Browse the current job offers or choose an item in the top navigation above. You will work within the project Art DATIS (Digital Art Technical sources for the Netherlands: Integration and improvement of sources on glass for a Sustainable future). Art DATIS is a research project (2018-2023) within the NWO Big Data/Digital Humanities programme. The project is a collaboration between the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam, RKD Netherlands Institute for Art History, the Free Glass Foundation, and Picturae. The production of free glass saw significant technological innovations in the twentieth century. Dutch glass artist Sybren Valkema’s (1916-1996) study of historical sources and his practical work contributed crucially to these innovations. What role did historical sources on the changing production of glass in Europe between 1500 and 1996 play in his work? How did he use these sources to innovate technology and education? Within the project these archives are enriched and linked to open data to answer these questions. One postdoctoral position is available for a Researcher in digital humanities. In collaboration with data scientists based at the University of Amsterdam (headed by Prof Evangelos Kanoulas) you will be responsible for the development of digital tools to make the archive accessible, and to conduct (technical art) historical research making use of these tools and the archives, to the project’s central questions about the history of glass technology and art education. The expected output includes two peer-reviewed articles, one in the digital humanities, the other in (art) history. Utrecht University The initial appointment (1.0 FTE), as from 1 April 2021, will be on a temporary basis for two years and four months.

Nazmus Saquib - Digital Humanities: Reflection,"January 25, 2021 On January 27th, the Islamicate Digital Humanities Network (IDHN) will organize a conference that will showcase a lot of my team’s research on understanding Hadiths as a narrative network. This is a special moment for all of us in the team, and definitely a milestone for me because I have been working on this meaty idea for close to a decade with my mentor/collaborator Mairaj Syed.  We have come together as a team (along with other colleagues) many times over the years to brainstorm, read, write code, visualize, and ponder about the implications of our results. I had the opportunity to attend and give talks in quite a few humanities workshops, conferences, and classes. I also read many papers in religious studies and worked with a few humanities researchers for this and other projects, so I feel comfortable to comment on the best practices for fruitful collaborations. In this post, I will summarize my understanding of the two very distinct cultures (sciences and humanities) as a scientist. This is solely based on my personal experience, but I hope it might help both sides of digital humanities to understand each other and manage expectations. Hadiths are a major source of available narratives on early middle eastern history. It is a huge body of narrations about the sayings of the Islamic prophet (and others) on different events and phenomena, that transmitters passed down from one generation to another (this claim is both refuted and supported by different evidences), and different generations recorded these in different books. Hadiths have far reaching implications to this day, as they often influence legal, cultural, political, and social decision making in the Muslim world, and they are also entangled with other cultures that are trying to understand Islam. The dynamics of these narratives reveal very important historical insights and provide a lens into the authenticity of the narratives and historical claims. I was an undergraduate student at Bard College (NY) studying physics and computer science when I met Mairaj in 2011. He was teaching an advanced Islamic Legal Theory class that I took. Even though science and engineering students often complain about their humanities classes and I was no different initially, the liberal arts culture at Bard slowly changed my views. I was drawn towards the humanities and was increasingly taking advanced humanities classes to fulfill my requirements, instead of the usual introductory classes science students take to get by.  Mairaj was a young professor, fresh out of Princeton with a PhD in religious studies, and I would approach him after the classes to talk about the kind of research they do in general. Mairaj used to be a student of information management and knew some coding and databases, so unlike many other humanities professors he would enthusiastically discuss possibilities in digital humanities research. We explored a few things in 2011 and 2012 on Isnads and Matn (information on how transmitters passed the Hadith literature). I wrote some code to combine Matns, and discussed results with Mairaj, but that was pretty much it. The project seemed to die down. After I left Bard to pursue a Master’s in Computing, I was increasingly drawn towards Network Science. In 2013, I reached back to Mairaj with the idea that we could interpret the Hadith literature as a social network of transmitters. Mairaj moved to UC Davis at the time. We collaborated again to explore some preliminary results in centrality metrics in the Hadith network. Mairaj was not an expert in any of web scraping, data mining, or network science, but over the next few years he taught himself a lot of the tricks by studying my and other people’s code.  When I started my PhD at MIT, we made an informal habit of visiting each other at MIT or UC Davis, and would have these few-days long hackathons where I would code non-stop and Mairaj would organize our data into better databases or historically interpret the computational results. We would discuss results and visualizations and talk about writing a book together. In fact, in 2015 I received a book offer from Princeton University Press, but we were not entirely sure if we could commit the time required for such a project so we passed the offer after drafting some parts of the book. From 2016, we doubled down on our efforts and made consistent progress. New members would join our team regularly. Some left and some stayed. Mairaj took care of all the management, with occasional support from myself. We started writing and getting grants. We eventually had some excellent technical people in the team (Danny Halawi, Mohamed Alkaoud, and recently Shuaib Choudhry) so I did not have to do heavy lifting on coding the analytics infrastructure anymore. We also had other humanities researchers give us feedback and discuss our work over long sessions. At this point, I shifted my attention and time to some of the theoretical questions that I have been exploring since the beginning, such as, what does the overall structure and dynamics of the Hadith network look like? What does it say about the current notions of Hadith transmission and disputes on early-Islamic history? I attended history and religious studies workshops and conferences since 2014, presenting my research on these questions. At the moment, our work's portfolio includes 1400 parsed books, with 50,000 authors and millions of links between them, and a collection of data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the narration dynamics in this huge network. Note that this was not my PhD research. My main interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Science, Interactive Computing, Design, and Wearable Sensors. However, I have been very passionate about this project, and whenever I got a chance or needed a break from my PhD work I would work on this. Having read some other religious studies PhD works, I feel comfortable to say that the impact of our team’s Hadith analytics works could be equated to several PhDs. I would not dare call it a second PhD for myself because I know my readings are not at the level of an actual humanities PhD. However, having done a lot of scattered readings over the years, I do entertain the idea at times that I should take a religion PhD qualifying exam to figure out where I am really at in this regard. With the background out of the way, let me summarize a few key differences between the sciences and humanities cultures. When speaking about science, I speak from experience in the CS, Physics, and Applied Math communities, but I have heard and read many stories from other science PhDs that I feel comfortable to make some general statements. Publication expectations: Probably the first thing a scientist (especially a computer scientist) would find surprising in the humanities land is the pace of publications. While quantity of papers doesn't reflect quality, computer scientists are used to submitting substantial new works and ideas to conferences every year. The pace at first may seem slow in a digital humanities collaboration.  One reason maybe is just the nature of research. Often times writing 500 lines of code to deal with a dataset is much easier than reading through big volumes of text and understanding the nuances presented by their authors. Even though coding clever algorithms is no small task, the humanities works often are the long and tedious ones. The other reasons for such prolific activity in the sciences have good and bad causal forces. The bad force is how money and grants are set up in the current system. The outcomes of grants are usually publications, and there is more money allocated for science/engineering. Therefore, many “garbage papers” are written in abundance in a “prolific” field like computer science to keep the money flowing. Even good scientists often feel pressured to churn out useless papers, and ignoring that mindset is a challenge when you are aiming for a job market.  Having said that, I think there is room for improvement in the humanities too, where the sciences are more or less doing it right. It boils down to team-based work. Team culture: The research works in humanities are often done by lone rangers, instead of large international collaborations and teams that are frequently seen in the sciences. For no-BS prolific scientists, frequent publications is the way to disseminate knowledge asap and open it up for critique, and science appears to move faster because of that. The challenge for a reader is to then filter through the incremental works described in #1 and find these gems. Once you build a reputation as a no-BS scientist/team, it’s easier to just find and follow your work.  This kind of international teamwork mindset could be adapted in the humanities too, with better means of knowledge distribution. Problem selection: When dealing with theory, I personally favor research in the Pasteur’s Quadrant, fundamental research that has applied use cases. Search for a never-ending series of abstractions — ignoring the human meaning making process — sometimes seems redundant to me. It is a view that I share with Sabine Hossenfelder, and this style of research seems to be prevalent among many theorists.  Interestingly, I think I have seen this trend in both the humanities and sciences. Without pointing out specific works, I would just say that the premature search for can-explain-it-all theories is quite abundant in both fields, whereas we should first look for provable hypotheses that may or may not generalize all too well. That is part of doing science. Superiority/Inferiority complex around technology: A recipe for disaster is to build an interdisciplinary team whose members don't know (or trust) each other’s strengths, or don't have the capability to understand the available strengths properly. Some scientists might think they are the genius here and doing others a favor. At the same time, humanities scholars may get excited at the prospect of applying technical methods without understanding the methods and their implications completely. It is inevitable for a new interdisciplinary team, and I was fortunate that in our team none of these happened, except occasional tensions at times.  I have observed such trends in other collaborations though. I have often seen HCI collaborations where a more technical person (say, a machine learning theorist) would be the person holding back the less technical but more humanities/social science oriented researchers, who may be waiting for the technical person to apply some cool techniques on their hard-earned, curated datasets. However, applying a cool method may not answer the question at hand, but both parties don’t seem to care as this might get them a new paper. To do good research, we need to understand each other’s works better. A corollary to this is that good team spirit in this realm means maintaining a delicate balance of trust and doubt, which brings me to my next point. Teacher and Colleague: In a good digital humanities collaboration, each person is both. As a teacher, you have to sometimes direct with certainty, but as a colleague you have to listen and trust. In our work, Mairaj’s subject matter expertise and mentorship guided my investigations. However, my emphasis on certain techniques paid off, and Mairaj had to trust me on my mathematical instincts on his subject matter. Presentation: This is a very minor but funny one. Let’s just say I was not impressed by slides with poor visual choices, such as cyan/purple backgrounds, full of yellow and red colored text, with no pictures, that some North American humanities professors were just reading out loud in some conference sessions. While I did see very good quality presentations in the same conferences, I didn’t realize slides that can instantly make you fall asleep could be part of the same sessions. You say I shouldn’t judge from a few conferences? I agree, but it was unexpected nonetheless. I am used to seeing demo videos with published papers, and well crafted slides for presentations in HCI. So naturally I would expect that professors who teach in US universities do not just read their slides that are full of text. Dissemination of knowledge in widely understandable and enjoyable formats should be prioritized by any researcher. I am not entirely qualified to comment on such a huge topic, but I can talk about this philosophy from the perspective of cognitive science and embodied mathematics, a field that formed the backbone of my PhD dissertation. To begin to understand the philosophical differences between sciences and humanities, and to act on reducing our existing biases and assumptions, we perhaps need to understand the nature of mathematical abstractions first. A. The nature of abstractions: Mathematics is feared by many, and a lot of works in the digital humanities require some level of mathematical maturity (coding is a form of mathematics too). The reason most people often feel lost in this land is because the gradual layers of abstractions and metaphors are often too many to form a coherent mental model. Let me explain with a diagram from my PhD dissertation. This is a rough sequence of mathematical abstractions that we are introduced to over a general learning trajectory in STEM. Embodied math is the domain that most humans understand naturally (object collection, shapes, drawing, manipulating small collections). The progression of subsequent mathematical reasoning is often based on abstractions that are introduced as metaphors. This view is championed by cognitive scientists.  The abstractions are often composed of layers of metaphors. For example, to really understand an algebra equation, you have to understand common metaphors in algebra, such as ""variables are boxes containing objects and each box can count how many objects are inside"", or + and - are the equivalent of adding or removing objects from the box. Just like a language, the metaphors can vary. Different metaphors may lead to the same outcome, and you can chain different metaphors together to get to an abstract concept. To put it simply, math is a collection of layers of metaphors. To understand math as a whole, we  need to establish connections between each metaphor, and at some point the layers may become cognitively arbitrary for many unless you actively trained to keep the connections in mind, which happens very rarely.  This is not only true for math. This is in fact true for any spoken language (George Lakoff's book Metaphors We Live By shows excellent examples of how a language is a collection of grounded symbols and layers of metaphors on top of these symbols), music (check out Adam Neely's excellent video ""what does music mean"" to understand how musical compositions are metaphors), sketching and drawing (check out Part V of the book Symbol Formation (1963)), etc. Sign game: mathematical rules can be arbitrary and context based. This does not only pose a cognitive challenge for the beginners, experts can be the victims of this trap too. Often a veteran computer scientist might use a wrong method because the context for the problem is different than what she thought the rules suggest. Sometimes the rules create new context, especially if you are always relying on the rules to guide yourself in making meaning. Wittgenstein called this phenomenon sign game. To put it simply, when you are relying on abstractions and not thinking through the metaphorical layers, there are chances that the shortcuts you are taking in your reasoning might land you in the wrong interpretation regions. B. Implications of abstractions: The way humans create meaning and form abstractions have profound implications in science, math, and humanities cultures. Any mathematical analysis of an event that is perceived by a human requires translating the event into symbolic abstractions, constructing the necessary layers of metaphors along the way. On your way back from the abstraction land to embodied meaning making, you may introduce some more metaphors and context that may or may not be consistent with the existing ones that you used on your way in. The same could be said about the humanities when a scholar applies a certain framework (say, a form of exegesis, feminism, a political theory etc.) to an event to make some nuanced meaning out of it. When viewed from this perspective, both data scientists and humanities scholars have something to be humble about. However, the burden is often more on the number-crunching folks. Translating embodied, perceived versions of events to an abstraction through metaphors is a tricky task. A data scientist treating numbers and data analysis as the truth will often fall into the trap of wrong interpretation, and this happens so often that it is embarrassing, and our predictions may turn out to be wrong. Does it mean we stop predicting using numbers? No. Mathematical abstractions are powerful tools for thinking and taking shortcuts in the process of ""meaning making"". What would be lifetime works of thousands of Hadith scholars, data mining, machine learning, and analytics can potentially turn that into a few days worth of work. However, it comes with the risk of wrong interpretations and predictions, or missing out nuances. A good approach to any problem is therefore to examine it from both perspectives. There is no greater or smaller work here. Stop thinking you are special if you know how to crunch numbers and many others don't! You simply are an expert in connecting some metaphor layers, and others can connect other forms of metaphors. I say this because I am tired of seeing how we, the computer scientists, are over-praised, and are over-confident about what we do to ""change the world"" in the name of innovation. Computer Science has given us very powerful tools and metaphors to model the world's information, but it comes with its own baggage. C. How do we get out of the abstractions trap? One possible way, out of a few, is to design better tools that take human cognition and cultures into account. Good tools would take away the headache of connecting the layers of metaphors, and/or make the connections between the layers clear for different contexts. This could eventually help both sides of digital humanities. Scientists use computational tools heavily, and the artifact(s) produced by these tools is their window into interpreting the reality. Tools that retain explainability is therefore the key, and such design efforts require collaboration between designers, algorithmists, and humanities scholars. You can read about how I approach this problem in my research on embodied math. The abstractions used in qualitative and quantitative research are fundamentally different. Each type of abstraction has its strengths and weaknesses. Some abstractions require more training than others, but I believe well designed tools can mitigate this problem eventually in the future. We also need a culture of appreciation for different abstractions. Just because I am connecting metaphor layers that some others have not trained for, does not mean they are connecting concepts, contexts, and metaphors that I will understand right away. So no one job is essentially “easy” or “hard”, it boils down to which abstractions your culture made you think were superior. As for the cultural differences I stated here, I hope these kinds of discussions will happen more, so the work and collaboration cultures become easier for both technical and humanities scholars.

UC San Diego Tommie Camarillo, Chair of the Chicano Park Steering Committee (CPSC), Stewards of Chicano Park, for over 40 years, has maintained an extensive library/archive of the history of Chicano Park. Chicano Park and the Chicano Park Monumental murals located in Barrio Logan/Logan Heights in San Diego, California is a National Landmark (2016) and listed on the National Register (2013). The archive/library documents a community’s self-determination to defy the City of San Diego and the State of California to build their own park in response to the Intrusion of Interstate 5 and the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge that displaced 75 percent of the residents in less than 14 years. The Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center’s Logan Heights Archival project is to digitize and inventory the Tomasa Camarillo archive/library of Chicano Park and Community history and to highlight a unique archival method embodied in the life of Tommie Camarillo and rooted in community values and empowerment that comes from the heart.

UC San Diego Co-PI: Diana SolisVisual Artist, Photographer & EducatorChicago, IL[Photo by Lucas Anti] The Latino Catskills is a digital project that resituates the rural Catskills region, located 100 miles northwest of New York City, as a generative space of Latino culture and identities. As this project documents, from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s, the Catskill mountains were a popular summer destination for countless Spaniards, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and others of Latin American descent. These Latino travelers took day trips (known as giras) or stayed at private dwellings and the many resorts owned by fellow Spanish speakers, such as the historic “Villas Hispanas” in Plattekill, New York. Our project reconstructs this important archive of Latino leisure culture through the development of a digital archive and map. By telling the stories of these forgotten sites, the project recenters recreation and leisure as important social components of the Latino experience, complementing dominant narratives of New York Latinidad, which have traditionally focused on the racialized experiences of urban poverty and toil.

University of Miami Libraries (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas: The Aida Barrera Digital Project highlights Aida Barrera’s career as creator of Carrascolendas. Through a close study of Carrascolendas, a bilingual children’s show produced during the 1970s in Austin, Texas, this digital humanities project demonstrates how Barrera, like other Latinas in the United States, engaged in social activism and contributed to race, gender and labor equality. While contextualizing Carrascolendas within broader histories, this project emphasizes the significance of Barrera’s labor and agency as a Latina in television production during the late twentieth century and examines how the Chicano and Civil Rights Movements influenced her approach to bilingual education. Additionally, (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas contributes to a wider understanding of race, gender, migration and language in the US-Mexico borderlands by underlining the immediate and long-term significance of Carrascolendas for Latino audiences.

Tejana Historias will additionally explore how the concepts of transborderism/transfronterizismo and transregionalism complicate these histories through a deep engagement of geography. This project will use both primary and secondary materials to provide a literal or figurative cultural/historical visualization that represents Tejana experiences. Visualizations will include artwork, photographs, newspaper articles, legal documents, treaties and maps, among other possible “artifacts.” The timeline will be composed of seven themes/periodizations: 1) Indigeneity y Tierra Natal, 2) Conquest and Colonization, 3) Migrations and Translocations within Modernity, 4) Empowering Communities in Juan Crow, 5) Articulations and Migrations, 6) Revolutions and Radical Transformations and 7) Reconquista. This phase of the project will concentrate on the first two themes and will be readily available for classrooms dedicated to social studies, Ethnic Studies or history as well as nontraditional educational settings as a tool of engagement for grade levels high school and above.

Lone Star College-North Harris, Houston El primer número del periódico La voz se publicó en Nueva York en julio de 1937, estableciendo desde su editorial que se trataba de una empresa de intenciones democráticas. La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años. Su trabajo intelectual sirve de base para el estudio de las fuertes conexiones entre feminismo y antifascismo que los artículos de La voz ponen de evidencia.

University of Connecticut #MAOD1889 is defined as the Modesta Avila: Obstructing Development Since 1889 multimedia, digital-arts project. Modesta Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Mexican/Mexican American folks. There are various versions of Modesta Avila's life and the various actions she took in the late 1880s to keep the Santa Fe Railroad from developing on her family's land, which was located in in the same region of what is now the San Juan Capistrano Train Station. The project will trace and focus on Modesta Avila’s life via a virtual timeline, a research contribution to the Recovery Program via their Omeka site and augmented reality. #MAOD1889 builds movement culture by preserving and re-presenting history from a people of color (POC) point of view. Among academic documentation, #MAOD1889 cites relevant photos, historical documents, media publications and urban tales from the community and local POC artists who have focused on Modesta Avila’s mugshot image to produce contemporary work. The archives will be used to source an online and book publication as well as a live hologram presentation. Through the use of the digital humanities, #MAOD1889 will provide readers and researchers the opportunity to scan the images with their phones and witness Modesta Avila come to life to tell her own story.

University of California-Berkeley The Puerto Rican Literature Project is a digital archive that maps the literary production of Puerto Rican writers from the archipelago and the diaspora since the Jones Act. It contains various photos, ephemera, and images of manuscripts in progress, some of which are housed at the archive at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, where a portion of this project began at a summer fellowship. In addition, we are creating various free digital teaching aids that educators can use to teach Puerto Rican literature in the classroom. Finally, the project will feature a page documenting the work of contemporary Puerto Rican writers through interviews, scholarly essays, craft talks, and book reviews.

92Y's Unterberg Poetry Center This project emphasizes the recovery of Ramírez’s maternal abuela’s writings. Her abuela, doña Ramona González, was born in El Paso, Texas in 1906 and wrote short stories, poems, fables, dichos, and more in 1960 – 1975. As an early Chicana writer, she published some of her writings in the important Chicano literary journal of El Grito’s (1967-1974) special issue Chicanas en la literatura y el arte of 1973. This project, however, focuses on doña Ramona’s seven hundred and fifty plus primary documents that she produced over her lifetime. Five years ago, the González/Hernández family (Ramírez’s immediate family) uncovered these documents tucked away in a cardboard box. These documents have now all been digitized, and a large majority have been translated by Dr. Ramírez’s father, Dr. Neil J. Devereaux. This project’s main goal is community accessibility of these primary document to the greater Latinx community. The Ramona González Papers Exhibit: The Ramona González Papers PI: Cristina Ramírez, PhD

University of Arizona This project understands 19th-century Latino publications from immigrant editors of Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico as fundamentally transnational phenomena engaged in the larger press networks of the Americas. The interactions between these three communities in the US often occurred in exchanges that have been lost or erased from the historical record despite their relevance to understanding how race and nationhood came to be understood locally and across national borders.

Morreale  (Harvard University)  The Medieval Academy announces that the 2022 Digital Humanities Award will be given to The Documentary Archeology of Late Medieval Europe (DALME).  This web-based research project was created to support the study of material culture of Europe from the thirteenth to the early sixteenth centuries .  Its dataset comprises inventories of various households and estates throughout Europe.  Although it only went online in January of 2021, the project houses over 500 records in twelve different languages.  Those records include ecclesiastical inventories, inventories from various regions in Italy, as well as inventories from Jewish households from Northern Europe. Each record includes a digital facsimile of the archival source, along with a diplomatic transcription of the relevant folios or pages (and in some cases published inventories that are no longer in copyright).  A second collection of individual objects is also part of the database, but this is still in the early stages.  DALME stood out amongst the other candidates because of three factors.  First, the web interface was well designed both aesthetically and functionally.  The user is able to navigate easily from record to record (and from page to page within a record).  In addition to a general search option, the dataset is well organized by coherent categories.  Each category also has a histogram to indicate how the records are clustered chronologically.  Second, the content is clearly scholarly and is the result of strong linguistic and paleographical skills of its contributors.  The quality of the content will ensure that this resource will be of use to both student and scholars.  As one referee noted, ""One of the happy consequences of this [project's] methodology is that DALME is useful to an interdisciplinary community of archaeologists, art historians, anthropologists, historians, linguists, and philologists, among others.""  Moreover, DALME has already been deployed in the classroom, which speaks to its diverse use and scholarly quality.  Finally,  DALME attends to the standards of open technologies and practices.  It has avoided using proprietary software and has adopted data standards already well established in the DH community. Moreover, those standards will provide opportunities for DALME's dataset to be integrated with other datasets using these same open standards, and this can open up future research opportunities.   This project also presented the best use of github in the storage and dissemination of the project.  While it is currently unclear if third-party applications can at present harvest from DALME's dataset, the infrastructure has already been established.  Such a strategy will ensure the longevity of this project when the project reaches its own terminus point.",https://zurl.co/bGFb

La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años. Su trabajo intelectual sirve de base para el estudio de las fuertes conexiones entre feminismo y antifascismo que los artículos de La voz ponen de evidencia.

The Digital Black Atlantic — University of Minnesota Press,"Coming soon Roopika Risam and Kelly Baker Josephs, Editors  Exploring the intersections of digital humanities and African diaspora studies  This timely collection of essays about the relationship between digital humanities and Black Atlantic studies offers critical insights into race, migration, media, and scholarly knowledge production. It spans the African diaspora’s range—from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean—while its essayists span academic fields—from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies.

 How can scholars use digital tools to better understand the African diaspora across time, space, and disciplines? And how can African diaspora studies inform the practices of digital humanities? These questions are at the heart of this timely collection of essays about the relationship between digital humanities and Black Atlantic studies, offering critical insights into race, migration, media, and scholarly knowledge production.  The Digital Black Atlantic spans the African diaspora’s range—from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean—while its essayists span academic fields—from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies. This transnational and interdisciplinary breadth is complemented by essays that focus on specific sites and digital humanities projects throughout the Black Atlantic. Covering key debates, The Digital Black Atlantic asks theoretical and practical questions about the ways that researchers and teachers of the African diaspora negotiate digital methods to explore a broad range of cultural forms including social media, open access libraries, digital music production, and video games. The volume further highlights contributions of African diaspora studies to digital humanities, such as politics and representation, power and authorship, the ephemerality of memory, and the vestiges of colonialist ideologies.  Grounded in contemporary theory and praxis, The Digital Black Atlantic puts the digital humanities into conversation with African diaspora studies in crucial ways that advance both.

 Jan 27 Wed, 27 January 2021 17:00 – 19:00 GMT Online event Despite the professional caricature of historians being uninterested in technology, historians have had a long track record of engaging with born-digital sources. This has necessarily involved critical conversations around digital preservation and access. These early encounters were driven by a wave of digitally-aware historians in the 1960s and 1970s, who were then then relatively central within the historical profession. The interdisciplinary journal Computers and the Humanities was established in 1966, and indeed, by 1970 the prospects for “computer-assisted historical projects” suggested the possibility of a wholescale transformation of the discipline. This current peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s.  At the same time, archivists and librarians were exploring digital preservation in earnest. During these first conversations about electronic records, historians played a prominent role at the table, helping to shape the conversation. This interdisciplinary engagement helped to shape early digital preservation efforts. Conversations would continue into the web age, with impact on this turn to networked information. By the mid-1990s, a small group of economic historians – tracing their lineage back to these early encounters – would help underscore the need for digital preservation and source stewardship. Their arguments presaged contemporary ones around computational history, forming an essential part of the historical context for any history of the digital humanities in general and digital history specifically. Yet, by the late 1990s (with some exceptions), historians largely disappeared from the conversation – unfortunately at a time when they were needed more than ever. In this presentation, part of my broader project “Averting the Digital Dark Age,” I explore the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Electronic records, to these historians, imperilled society’s collective memory. What was to be done? All are welcome.  The event will run on Zoom. The link and passcode will be provided on your confirmation email when you register. This event is organised by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, which is part of the UCL Institute of Advanced Studies.

Transkribus is run by the European Cooperative Society READ-COOP SCE. The University of Denver, as part of the first cohort in the Collections as Data: Part to Whole Mellon funded initiative in collaboration with the READ-COOP is hosting a workshop that  will introduce the main features of the Transkribus platform. Attendees will learn how to upload their documents to the platform, how to generate training data, how to train the HTR engine and how to apply their own models or existing ones. They will get some background knowledge on the technology used and what should be obeyed in order to get the best results. In the advanced part of the workshop they will also learn how to transform existing transcriptions from former projects into a format which can be used to train the Transkribus engine. Finally attendees will also get an insight into the web-applications for searching and displaying Transkribus documents on the web.

Her scholarly work focuses on utilizing visual analysis, historical perspectives, and interdisciplinary theories in order to understand the importance of art in cultural events and debates throughout history.  Through her course American Monument Cultures, Hutchinson invites students to examine the intersections between visual art and postcolonial studies and learn about the history of monument culture in the United States. “A monument that celebrates a slaveholder or a colonizer might seem to some to point merely to history, to the past,” Hutchinson said. “But for others who are experiencing the ongoing legacies of those violent histories, these symbols structure their comfort and ease moving through public space.” Students in Hutchinson’s course study historical contexts to understand the role of monuments in public spaces and created digital projects centering a monument’s impact on a city or town. They also learn how to integrate virtual story maps, timelines, and intensive research skills to produce projects that expand on course content.  Additionally, Hutchinson uses this course to emphasize the crucial link between activism and public visual art. “What I hope students will come to understand is that works of art are powerful and they speak to specific times and places,” she said. “I also want them to know that activism matters and to understand how change can take place in the [public art] landscape.” To learn more about Hutchinson’s American Monument Cultures course, watch the video above.  — SOLBY LIM ’22

Call for Participation: Digital Humanities Summer Institute Conference and Colloquium 2021 (Online!) – The Digital Humanities Commons,"Those of you who have been following the development of the DH Commons from the beginning will know that Professor Ray Siemens of the University of Victoria, Canada gave the keynote address at our DH Commons launch event in November 2019. Ray looms large as a figure in North American DH circles not just because of his scholarship but also because of the spirit of open-minded and friendly collaboration that he brings and encourages others to foster in the DH community.   As a part of that spirit, Ray is also the head of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at University of Victoria. Each year, the DHSI community comes together for two weeks in Victoria to participate in a series of foundational and advanced week-long workshops and conferences. This year, DHSI is transitioning to an online program, and as a part of that program there will be a conference and colloquium. This will consist of pre-recorded paper presentations ranging from 5 to 20 minutes in length. Topics for the papers can cover any field or discipline related to digital humanities and/or the application of digital methodologies to transform traditional research. The colloquium is actually a collection of conferences which include specific CFPs for the following topics: As yet there are also two associated events as part of the colloquium. These include a workshop on Research Data Management for Digitally Curious Humanists, hosted by Lisa Goddard ( U Victoria Libraries), Shahira Khair (U Victoria Libraries), and James Doiron (U Alberta Libraries). and the GraphPoem event hosted by UC Louvain’s Altissia Chair of Digital Humanities, Professor Chris Tananescu.  The online conference will take place during the two weeks of DHSI, which are scheduled during the weeks of 7-11 June and 14-18 June 2021. According the CFP, “[a]fter the event, we will invite participants to contribute papers to a special issue of Interdisciplinary Digital Engagements in Arts & Humanities (IDEAH), a peer-reviewed, online, open-access journal founded as a mechanism for distributing the innovative, engaging scholarship shared annually at DHSI.” Each of the above listed conferences within the colloquium has its own CFP, and the deadline for submissions for ALL of the CFPs is Thursday, February 25, 2021.

Introduction to Digital Humanities | edX,"Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. As primary sources of information are more frequently digitized and available online than ever before, how can we use those sources to ask new questions? How did Chinese families organize themselves and their landscapes in China’s past? How did African slaves from different cultures form communities in the Americas? What influences informed the creation and evolution of Broadway musicals? How can I understand or interpret 1,000 books all at once? How can I create a visualization that my students can interact with? The answers to these questions can be explored using a wide variety of digital tools, methods, and sources.  As museums, libraries, archives and other institutions have digitized collections and artifacts, new tools and standards have been developed that turn those materials into machine-readable data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for example, have enabled humanities researchers to processvastamounts of textual data. However, these advances are not limited just to text. Sound, images, and video have all been subject to these new forms of research.  This course will show you how to manage the many aspects of digital humanities research and scholarship. Whether you are a student or scholar, librarian or archivist, museum curator or public historian — or just plain curious — this course will help you bring your area of study or interest to new life using digital tools.

Visionary Futures Collective,"The Visionary Futures Collective is a community of humanists working in and around higher education. Our goals include increasing transparency, sharing vulnerability, and working collectively to imagine and create a better future for higher education. First Friday Tarot Parties: Join us on zoom to read tarot and talk about the future of higher education. All are welcome. Email visionaryfuturescollective@gmail.com for the Zoom link.  Postcards of Rage and Renewal: We are working with Inkcap Collective to mark the second anniversary of the coronavirus lockdown with a collective art project. Sign up to participate.  We also occasionally communicate via our  newsletter. We have a few remaining academic tarot decks for sale.  Scroll down to learn more about our work and our mission. Want to get involved? Send us an email: visionaryfuturescollective@gmail.com  Using data to visualize campus responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Visionary Futures Collective brings together humanists across the United States to tackle challenges relating to the present and future of higher education.  This group is made up of scholars of the humanities. Many, but not all of us have or are currently pursuing graduate degrees. Many, but not all of us work or study at universities. Some, but not most of us, are professors. All of us believe in the transformational power and vital importance of the humanities. This group believes that the study of human history and cultural expression is essential to a more just and meaningful society. Our purpose is to create the conditions in which this work can thrive.   We begin with the premise that current conditions in higher education are incompatible with the work of the humanities. We formed at the start of the coronavirus pandemic because we understood that this public health crisis would exacerbate the structural inequities that characterize U.S. higher education. Our work is shaped by the long-overdue national reckoning with racial inequities led by the Black Lives Matter movement.   We believe that humanities labor must be carried out under conditions that do not put our lives or our health at risk. We believe that humanities labor is valuable, and must be credited and compensated fairly and equitably.  We believe the systems in higher education that depend on labor exploitation, racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, and other forms of oppression must be dismantled.   We believe that higher education should be for the public good, and that the work of the humanities should be conducted for and with our communities.  We recognize that these conditions will not be created through top-down change, and so we aim to build collective action from the bottom up.  We are constantly learning new ways to enable change, but this group focuses on increasing transparency in higher education; creating compassionate communities through shared vulnerability; and working collectively to shift institutional practices.

 The purpose of this paper is to examine the structure, patterns and themes of interdisciplinary collaborations in the digital humanities (DH) research through the application of social network analysis and visualization tools. The sample includes articles containing DH research in the Web of Science Core Collection as of December 2018. First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among disciplinary were extracted from the subject category. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators and interdisciplinary communities were calculated. Third, the research topics of different interdisciplinary collaboration communities based on system keywords, author keywords, title and abstracts were detected. The findings reveal that while the scope of disciplines involved in DH research is broad and evolving over time, most interdisciplinary collaborations are concentrated among several disciplines, including computer science, library and information science, linguistics and literature. The study further uncovers some communities based on closely collaborating disciplines and the evolving nature of such interdisciplinary collaboration communities over time. To better understand the close collaboration ties, the study traces and analyzes the research topics and themes of the interdisciplinary communities. Finally, the implications of the findings for DH research are discussed. This study applied various informetric methods and tools to reveal the collaboration structure, patterns and themes among disciplinaries in DH research.

"My application to the Office of Digital Humanities wasn’t funded, what’s next?  | The National Endowment for the Humanities","Alert for Individual Applicants: Grants.gov & Deadline Extensions After several months of waiting for that email notification, you learn that the NEH did not select your application for funding. You are extremely disappointed and wonder if you should apply again, and if so, how to go about revising and resubmitting.   For every round of grant announcements, there are far more rejected applicants than awardees, so remember you are not alone. In fact, you are in very good company. The funding ratio for the Digital Humanities Advancement Grants (DHAGs) announced in December 2020 was at 10%.   When reading the big list of new NEH awardees, what you can’t see is that many of those individuals and project teams did not receive a grant on their first try. Indeed, 38% of December 2020’s DHAG awardees had received rejections from the NEH in the past year.   Below are a few tips for moving forward after receiving a rejection from the ODH, intended to help you rethink your application and project design for another round.   Soon after you receive your notification email, request anonymized peer review evaluations by emailing the Office of Digital Humanities (@email).   Please note, we are a small office and so this process can take a few weeks because of the volume of requests. And don’t forget to include your application number in your email!  Evaluations of grants submitted to the ODH typically reflect feedback from 3-5 experts in digital humanities, representing a wide spectrum of the field. Reviewers read 10-20 applications individually, meet virtually to discuss the applications with program staff, and then finalize their evaluations. The feedback you receive will reflect this long and careful process.  Review the comments when you are really ready to receive them. This may mean reading them quickly once they arrive in your inbox, feeling annoyed, and then returning to them the next day when you’re ready to read them alongside the application you submitted.   Ask yourself: Have your evaluators identified some issues that you had not considered? Was there something about your project that reviewers did not understand? Were you unclear in sections where you now could add more detail to help the evaluators? Did you address all of required elements of the application? Was your budget reasonable for the activities proposed? Did reviewers recommend that you investigate a different NEH grant program?   Spend some time analyzing and reviewing comments and the ratings, much like you would after receiving readers’ reports on an article or manuscript. Note where reviewers are consistent in their praise, meaning there is less work in certain areas, and focus on where they are consistent in their critiques.   Peer reviewers, however, do not always agree on strengths and weaknesses of applications. Highlight those places of disagreement for discussion with your colleagues, and perhaps with ODH program staff.    Ask yourself some difficult questions: Are you prepared to spend multiple weeks/months revising this application in pursuit of this funding opportunity? Might there be smaller or less competitive sources of funding to pursue for your project or to test out your ideas?   Sometimes the revisions required to turn your project into a competitive application will not serve your bigger goals. On the other hand, sometimes a rejected application only needs a few minor edits to become fundable. It's always worth taking the time to make sure that a revision is a good course of action.  If you are unsure whether to re-apply, or how best to incorporate reviewer feedback into a new application, contact the ODH. One of our program staff members will be able to review the comments with you and help to identify areas that might need the most attention in revising the application or in the project design. Please remember that staff’s comments are not part of the formal review process and have no bearing on its final outcome.  If appropriate, ODH staff may also direct you to another grant program at the NEH that might be a better fit to fund your digital project. (Read this blog post we have created to help direct applications to the right NEH grant program for funding digital projects.)   When you revise an unfunded application and resubmit it for a new deadline, it will be reviewed by a completely new set of peer reviewers who will not know that you submitted in the past.   You do not need to state that your application is a resubmission. The peer reviewers will not have access to your prior application or reviews.  It is a fresh start, and we encourage all applicants to make use of the materials available for writing strong applications:  Read the updated Notice of Funding Opportunity carefully as requirements change from year to year.  Read sample applications available on the grant program’s page (for example, the Institutes for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities program)  Watch a program webinar, if available (for example, for the Digital Humanities Advancement Grants program).  Find and read blog posts written by ODH on preparing strong applications.   Submit a draft before the program’s deadline (check program pages and NOFO for dates).  We hope these tips will encourage you to consider all options available to you after learning that your ODH application was not funded.  And if you are ready to discuss your options with the ODH, please get in touch about the possibility of revising and resubmitting your application.   Scam Advisory: Recent reports indicate that individuals are posing as the NEH on email and social media.

Programming for Humanists at TAMU,"Programming4Humanists provides courses designed to introduce participants to methodologies, coding, and programming languages associated with the Digital Humanities. We focus on creation, editing, and searchability of digital archives, but also introduce students to data mining and statistical analysis.   Our forte at Texas A&M University (TAMU) is Optical Character Recognition of early modern texts, a skill we learned in completing the Early Modern OCR Project, or eMOP. Another strength that the Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) (http://codhr.tamu.edu) at TAMU brings to this set of courses is the Texas A&M University Press book series called Coding for Humanists. We use draft and final versions of these books, as well as many additional resources available on companion web pages, for participants in the workshop. The books in this series are of course upon publication available to anyone, along with the companion sites, whether the person has participated in the workshop or not. However, joining the Programming4Humanists (P4H) course enables participants to communicate with the authors of these books for the sake of asking questions and indeed, through their questioning, helping us to improve the books and web materials. Our goal is to help people learn Digital Humanities methods and techniques. Those who should attend include faculty, staff, librarians, undergraduates, and graduate students, anyone interested in acquiring skills for work in digital humanities and cultural analytics. Generally, the Fall semester of P4H is for anyone interested in making archival and cultural materials available to a wide audience while encoding them digitally according to best practices, standards that will allow them to submit their digital editions for peer review by organizations such as the MLA Committee for Scholarly Edition and NINES / 18thConnect. Participants will learn to code documents and manipulate them. The Spring semester is more advanced, presenting methods for data mining. Participants will learn a programming language in order to perform textual analysis on largely unstructured documents.

Inspired by her unit on indexing, as well as by the ideas explored in three other key texts – Lewis Carroll’s An Index to ‘In Memoriam’ (1862), Stephen Ramsay’s call for play in “The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around,” and Ronald Day’s comparison of indexing to “surface reading” in Indexing It All – students in ENG 398: Digital Victorians did two things. First, they created an index for Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “Sonnets from the Portuguese” (1850). Second, they wrote a brief essay assessing the implications of using indexes versus digital tools to “sort” and comprehend a literary work. Although we worked with a set of poems, this assignment can easily be adapted to a novel, set of novels, or a collection of short stories (i.e., the Sherlock Holmes stories or Kipling’s Plain Tales from the Hills). In addition to having students comprehend the purpose and (brief) history of the index, the learning objectives of this assignment were three-fold: To make this assignment engaging and comprehensible, we broke it into discrete steps that took place over four class meetings. Class Meetings 1 & 2:  In preparation for these class periods, students skimmed Lewis Carroll’s index and looked over excerpts from Henry Wheatley’s What is an Index? (1878) and How to Make an Index (1902). They also read the guidelines for creating an index from University of Georgia Press as well as Day’s “Indexing It All.” After discussing how, why, and when an index might be useful, students were asked to read “Sonnets from the Portuguese” with an eye to creating an index. Students discussed the relationships among concepts and words and how an index differed from a “key words” list. By discussing the purpose and methods of indexing, students came to appreciate why word searches and tools for text visualization alone could not generate an effective index (e.g., Voyant, Wordle, or Lexos). Class Meeting 3:  For homework, students created seven index entries and a rationale for their entries. These were posted on the course blog. In class, we shared entries and rationales. Interestingly, this opened onto a larger conversation about subentries and cross-references, and how such organizational categories reflected and inflected how we understood “Sonnets from the Portuguese.” As a class, then, we used Google Docs to compile our individual entries into a single index. We spent 50 minutes doing this. While students were working on adding and refining the index on their laptops, we had a discussion on what the index should look like (i.e., formatting, font, etc.) and how the index might serve a reader. Class Meeting 4: For the final class period, students did a close reading of select sonnets in order to see how “reading indexically” differed from “close reading.” We also broadened our conversation to talk about how these practices of reading intersected with or departed from reading practices we had explored earlier in the semester, including surface reading and distant reading.   Students thus were equipped to write a 1000-1500 word essay about their experiences. Their essays responded to some of the following questions:   This assignment yielded a number of interesting insights into “Sonnets from the Portuguese,” as well as into indexing, digital tools, and practices of reading. Moreover, the final essays generally were thoughtful, creative, and full of fascinating associations and connections. Students found this assignment to be an easy way to explore issues related to information, organizational systems, and reading practices – issues that are also, yet differently, explored in the digital humanities. I lay out the structure of this assignment in the hope that others can adapt it to examine a novel, set of novels, or short stories.    Winter Jade Werner, Wheaton College More information about text formats University of North Texas

DH in Korea: The Digital Humanities Lab at the Academy of Korean Studies – The Digital Orientalist,"The Digital Orientalist Practical examples and theoretical reflections on the do's and don'ts of using digital tools for your study and research in African and Asian Studies. In a previous post I briefly presented some of the richest and most commonly used online resources for Korean Studies. There I suggested that despite the plethora of premodern textual material that is freely available online, it remained to be seen what kind of digital humanities work scholars of Korea would be able to produce. Many factors contribute to this lukewarm reception on the peninsula itself, but chief among them is the sentiment among scholars that the barrier to entry is too high. The time investment required to learn how to generate meaningful research using computer-assisted analysis is too great in the publish-or-perish world of Korean academia. This is a reality that many of us in the West understand all too well. However, a younger group of scholars more at ease with digital interfaces and forward-thinking established faculty with graduate student assistants, are producing notable DH projects and making incremental progress towards establishing an ecosystem that encourages the consumption of historical facts and digitized archival data by scholars, students, and the general public. In this post I will introduce the Digital Humanities Laboratory initiative at the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS) as a case study of the use of the wiki platform to create and publish premodern content. The initiative is comprised of seven groups that are responsible for different aspects of the DH Lab’s overarching goal which is to “encourage the innovative reproduction of human knowledge in creative ways in the digital environment.” Based on the concept of the wiki platform, each group has its own wiki site with linked and nested pages that provide more information about a project or a piece of cultural heritage. These are linked, most with English titles, at the top of the bare bones landing page. Of these, the “Jangseogak Wiki” is worth noting because the results of some of the annual academic workshops and training programs held at the Changsŏgak Archives are published here as collaborative wiki content.   For instance, the 2016 Hanmun workshop’s translations from literary Chinese to English of selected documents from the Chosŏn (also transliterated as Joseon) Dynasty are available as English language wiki pages along with the original text, images of the original documents, and references for further research. This type of translation work, although extremely beneficial to scholars and fields of study as a whole, is very often eschewed by scholars because they are time consuming and because the evaluative systems for tenure in academia do not value translation as worthy scholarly output. Publishing translations generated collaboratively in training workshops as wiki content, though it does not adequately address all the issues mentioned above, may be a model that other fields of study might want to iterate on to address this issue. Another interesting cluster in the AKS DH Lab is the “Encyves.” This is a neologism that blends the concepts of the encyclopedia and the archives together. As opposed to traditional encyclopedias, the contents of the Encyves are structured as nodes of a network, where each entry is linked to related entries through relationship tags displayed as a network visualization graph (an example is the featured image at the top of this post) and table at the bottom of the page. These visualizations help users see macro-level patterns in the historical documents more readily than text and encourage exploration of the Encyves‘s other entries. Further multi-media offerings like video content, 3D animations, and VR of sites and objects add to the discovery of the subject of an entry in various formats. A VR pavilion of historical buildings, objects, and past museum exhibitions gives users from all over the world access to an immersive experience of being on site. As well as the augmented reality capabilities of being able to  on icons in the simulation.  VR simulation of the Hoeam-sa temple site in Yangju, Kyŏnggi province, South Korea. Users can move through the site by ing on labeled guide circles on the screen.   Some of these entries have been grouped into general themes, such as “monk stupa stele inscriptions” that lists all actors, places, objects, and texts that are related to monk stupa stele inscription entries in the Encyves. These types of groupings point to the wealth of content on this site and provide an alternative structure to the alphabetical listing that traditional encyclopedias would employ to organize knowledge. This, however, obviates the ways in which the DH Lab privileges specific types of cultural history and relationships. It is truly to the DH Lab team’s credit that they have been able to organize and present such a staggering amount of premodern material in a digital format. Self-identified as a work in progress, there are several areas that could still benefit from further development. Beyond the numerous broken links and empty wiki pages, the Encyves do a poor job of combining the archive with encyclopedia. For example, it is surprising that the entry for the Mogŭnjip 牧隱集, a collection of poems written by the late Koryŏ scholar Yi Saek, does not include or directly link to the freely available text. Another aspect of the Encyves project that should be reconsidered is the presentation of digital media, such as 3D imaging and VR, as appropriate parts of an archive. Though these models are based on photography and 3D imaging software, they are nevertheless recreations of an object or place hundreds of years later than the date presented in an Encyves entry. The current format offers engagement with objects and places as holistically as possible, but this is often times at odds with the incomplete actuality of the thing or site itself. This is an important issue for cultural heritage preservation, archaeology, and art history that I will address in a subsequent post about digital images and remote research.   On a practical note, this portal is a great tool for students who are interested in learning about Korean History. The DH Lab even has an entire department that features English language wikis on Korean Studies topics called Korea 100. For those who are teaching in an online format this coming semester, these wikis are accessible and helpful assignments especially since they touch upon some underrepresented topics and can contribute to diversifying your syllabi. Ultimately this initiative, though insufficient in many ways, models many of the ideals digital humanities projects aspire to: collaboration, dynamic and multi-faceted use, iterability. It also offers an alternative to the current incommensurability between an academic publishing system that still has yet to figure out an acceptable way to deal with born-digital or digital-reliant humanistic scholarship. The AKS DH Lab provides a prototype for other fields to build upon and showcases the potential of the wiki platform in the digital dissemination and creation of scholarly and public-facing historical content.

"One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr. Roberto Busa in His Own Words | Data, Culture & Society"," Close Jointly hosted by the Centre for Data, Culture & Society and UCL DH, this event features contributors to the new volume One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa S.J. in His Own Words edited by Julianne Nyhan and Marco Passarotti (Springer 2020). Roberto Busa S.J. is often described as one of the founders of the field now known as Digital Humanities, but many of his writings are difficult to access. One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa S.J. in His Own Words draws on extensive archival research to select and contextualise previously out of print or inaccessible writings of Busa, translated into English for the first time. Each article is paired with a new introduction; in addition, a substantial new chapter analyses Busa’s intellectual legacy for Digital Humanities methodology. A complete bibliography of Busa (1949-2009), and an oral history interview with Busa’s translator (Philip Barras), is also included. This authoritative collection makes available, for the first time, fundamental primary and secondary sources that are crucial for the writing of histories of the Digital Humanities. The book moreover presents a deeper, more complex account of the data-led work of Busa, whose work is highly-cited yet little critiqued, and thus a new insight into the data-foundations of the (Digital) Humanities. This seminar features discussions from contributors and is chaired by CDCS Director Professor Melissa Terras. 1. Melissa Terras (University of Edinburgh): Introduction 2. Julianne Nyhan (UCL) and Marco Passarotti (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore): ""Reflections on the production of One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa in his own words."" 3. Geoffrey Rockwell (University of Alberta): ""Knowing through algorithms: How exactly did Busa and Tasman process words with calculating machines?"" In this paper Geoffrey Rockwell will look at different descriptions of the innovative process developed for concerning by Busa and Tasmin. This will lead to reflections on how Father Busa, a philosopher, thought computing could model knowing. 4. Steve Jones (University of South Florida): ""Where Was CAAL?"" In 1956, Roberto Busa, S.J., founded CAAL, the Centro per L'Automazione dell'Analisi Letteraria. After several years in temporary locations, in 1961 CAAL settled in a former textile factory outside Milan. What is the significance of that physical plant and location when it came to the institutional realities of CAAL and its work?   First broadcast on 20 January 2021.

"New Department “Digital Humanities and Social Studies“ › Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology","New Department “Digital Humanities and Social Studies“ As part of the High-Tech Agenda Bavaria, the new Department of Digital Humanities and Social Studies (DHSS) started its work on 1 January 2021. The new department is dedicated to the research challenge of translating cultural and social worlds into data and formal models and interpreting the computer-assisted analysis to draw conclusions for our lives in society. The department at a glance: New HTA professorships: The new department is keen to promote strong interdisciplinary connections and targeted collaboration with selected central institutions at FAU. As a university which offers the entire spectrum of academic disciplines, FAU offers the perfect framework for interdisciplinary collaboration, a clear advantage when it comes to establishing digital humanities as a key research priority. The transdisciplinary nature of the new professorships will allow established subjects in the area of humanities at FAU to benefit from increased digital expertise. Since 2016, a degree programme in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences has been offered at Bachelor’s and Master’s level. The HTA at FAU The new department (short DHSS) is mirrored by the new department for Data Science (DDS) at the faculty of natural sciences, which will include five professorships and focus on base research on the mathematics of data science and statistics. The concepts for both departments were selected from a range of internal concept proposals and were evaluated and recommended by the Executive Board, the deans and external review panels. Established professorships and institutions of other faculties and departments will be cooperating with the new departments, for example by means of primary or secondary membership, supporting a maximum of interdisciplinary work. Both departments forego conventional chair structures and are thus piloting innovative concepts for the structural development of FAU. ‘I am very proud of the way our universities are seizing the opportunities the High-Tech Agenda Bavaria and the acceleration programme High-Tech Agenda Plus offer for widening the scope of their research. FAU is a shining example of how new, additional professorships can collaborate with existing ones,’ says Bavarian minister of science Bernd Sibler. ‘The future is built on ideas, visions and expertise. That is clearly reflected in FAU’s concept. Interdisciplinarity has always been a feature of FAU. Bringing researchers together in these new structures, however, will move the collaboration which has until now been more on a case by case basis into a whole new dimension.’ ‘By establishing these two new departments, we are powering ahead with the next stage of the High-Tech Agenda at FAU at the same time as driving forward our own university strategy for the future #FAU2025,’ explains FAU President Prof. Dr. Joachim Hornegger. ‘The professorships included in the new departments will also perfectly complement the research of their colleagues in the newly established Department of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering. I am particularly pleased about the huge potential benefits for our students. The degree programmes Data Science and Digital Humanities & Social Sciences will profit from an even greater level of subject expertise and a wider range of topics.’

UK-Ireland collaboration in digital humanities – UKRI,"Last updated: 12 April 2021                     Apply for funding for digital humanities research. Your project must be large, innovative and multidisciplinary. UK and Ireland-based researchers must collaborate on the project. The themes are: AHRC will provide up to £320,000 per project for UK costs, at 80% of the full economic cost. The Irish Research Council (IRC) will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%). Your project must start on 1 August 2021 and last for up to 36 months. Standard eligibility criteria (please see section two of AHRC’s research funding guide) will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK principal investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the principal investigator and any co-investigators to devote an average of at least four hours per week to the project. The UK component must fall within the remit of AHRC. Inter-disciplinary proposals are welcome but the majority of the methodologies, research questions and outputs must fall within AHRC’s subject remit. Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a project partner letter of support. Guidance on what needs to be included in a project partner letter of support is provided on page 71 of the AHRC research funding guide. Co-investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s international co-investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the case for support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration. Please refer to the AHRC research funding guide for further information on AHRC’s international co-investigator policy and which costs are eligible within a UK budget. The Irish principal investigator and co-investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the IRC’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the digital humanities field. Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date. In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the IRC before the award’s commencement. There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified. Please note that attendance at the programme’s UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Networking Workshop (October 2019), and/or engagement with its Research Networking Call, is not a pre-condition of application to this call. Specifically, the call aims to support a diverse range of projects that: The projects should take innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to explore the broad and inclusive themes: AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project. The IRC will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%).  Each award must start by 1 August 2021 and should have a duration of up to 36 months. The principal investigator in the UK will be responsible for submitting a joint UK-Ireland proposal through the research council’s Joint Electronic Submission system (Je-S). Applications should be submitted through the Je-S system by 18 March 2021 16:00, and will need to go through the appropriate institution submission process prior to this. To prepare a proposal form in Je-S: Je-S will then create a proposal form, displaying the relevant section headings. Using the blue question marks and the ‘Help’ link at the top of each section will provide guidance relevant to that section of the form. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one principal investigator to be included in a proposal. For this AHRC-IRC call, there is to be one principal investigator from the UK and one from Ireland. On the Je-S form the principal investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a co-investigator. Such terminology must be considered as a built-in system feature, and does not challenge the equal status and co-leadership of the UK and Irish PI. All investigators named on the Je-S application form, whether based in the UK or Ireland, must have a Je-S account. Where a named investigator does not already have a Je-S account, one can be easily set up, but please note that the process can take a number of days. It is therefore strongly recommended that the process is started well before the application deadline. Following the deadline for submission, all proposals will be checked for eligibility. After the deadline for submissions, PIs will be informed of any outstanding return for amendment requirements. Five working days will be given for the return for amendment process. More information about this process will be provided at the relevant stage of the call. Eligible proposals will be reviewed by AHRC and IRC nominated reviewers and there will a principal investigator response stage in April/May 2021. The PI response should be submitted by the UK principal investigator in consultation with the Irish principal investigator. A joint moderating panel will take place in early June where the eligible proposals will be graded and ranked. The panel will be comprised of members of the AHRC’s Peer Review College and academic reviewers nominated by the IRC. The panel will moderate the reviewers’ scores for each proposal, agree a ranked priority list of applications and make funding recommendations to the AHRC and the IRC. The panel will be asked to be consider the following criteria when making recommendations to the AHRC and IRC for funding. Excellence and vision: People, partnerships and management: Data management: Value for money: Outputs, dissemination, impact and sustainability: It is expected that 4 to 6 awards will be made under this call, with the aim of having a balanced portfolio of awards across the thematic areas, (subject to proposals meeting the criteria and quality standards detailed above). Outcomes will be issued in early July 2021. Enquiries: fic@ahrc.ukri.org Dr Jamie Davies, International Partnerships and Engagement Manager Enquiries: digital.humanities@research.ie Dr Chiara Loda, Programme Manager Brenda Blake, Research Support Officer The Research Grants Call is part of a collaborative funding programme between the AHRC and the IRC which aims to deliver a transformational impact on digital humanities research in the UK and Ireland. The programme will exploit complementary strengths in the digital humanities in the UK and Ireland, leading to new partnerships and cross-disciplinary projects, building capacity and enhancing the integration of humanities and technology in digital humanities development. It builds on the ‘UK-Ireland Collaboration in the Digital Humanities’ scoping workshop that took place in Dublin from 22 to 23 October 2019 and the UK-Ireland Collaboration in the Digital Humanities Research Networking Call. You can find answers to frequently asked questions on the IRC website (PDF, 308KB). This may be updated whilst the call is open, so please check for further updates.

Heimonen_abstract | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki,"Abstract The presentation examines what insights text mining in the ECCO and other Enlightenment databases can bring to musical analysis of Mozart's piano concerto corpus. The music analytical part of research is based on a narratological model of dialogue in Mozart's concerto form developed in my dissertation that juxtaposes internal dialogue with cultural influences. Here one argues for a novel explanation of mechanism of dialogue between solo and ritornello (orchestra) sections in concerto form. The presentation is based on an existential semiotic framework that seeks resemblances of morality, passions and related concepts between Enlightenment society and narratological features in concertos. Of special importance are those concertos (KV 467, 482, 453, 456), where this interaction is the result of historical layering of discourse and the deontic forces that arise in the ensuing dialogue. The paper further enquires if this is a symptom of a broader stylistic change that rearranges baroque, classical and romantic influences within classical style paving the way to romanticism and possibly provoking parallels with the idea of a second Enlightenment. In analyzing the text corpus distributional semantics will serve the purpose of finding such occurrences that hold resemblance to moral terms and topics found in the concerto corpus. A thoroughgoing issue in the paper is how the examination of these phenomena can be supported by DH methodologies. To build up a sense of representation of an individual in society within a concerto's solo-ritornello alteration, one needs a methodology to describe an 18th century person's sociability. In terms of topics and morality one needs to be able to identify them as belonging either to individual or social spheres. A close counterpart would be private and public spheres as they were conceived in the Enlightenment. A third factor to be considered is the ancient regime with a sociability of its own. To match with the concertos an examination of individual-social -relation from Baroque to romanticism is needed because of the historical layering of concerto dialogue. The nature of interaction is subject to change in individual's reaction to changing societal norms that in the study are depicted as deontic statements in natural language. In finding co-occurring terms distributional semantics helps to find similarities and differences between moral terms and topics and to form corresponding groups of concepts. Here the role of benevolence is especially central. In the above group of four concertos the interaction is especially geared toward progressive sociability and the group serves as a corpus for a study that is more limited in scope. In a wider study of the whole concerto corpus an even broader parallel examination of stylistic and historical changes of moral and topical content becomes possible. In the process a conception of representation of culture will emerge. The latter research will also allow a stylistic re-evaluation of Mozart's concertos and the model of concerto form behind it.

A Practical Toolkit on Successful Grant Writing Skills: A Workbook for Development Professionals The AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project.
The IRC will provide up to €270,000. Each award must start by 1st August 2021 and should have duration of up to 36 months.
Eligibility Criteria Proposals must include at least one researcher from both the UK and Ireland and must have a Principal Investigator (PI) in each country. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one Principal Investigator to be included in a proposal. On the Je-S form, the Principal Investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a Co-Investigator. UK applicants:
Standard eligibility criteria will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK Principal Investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the Principal Investigator and any Co-Investigators to devote an average of at least 4 hours per week to the project.
The UK component must fall within the remit of the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a Project Partner Letter of Support.
Co-Investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s International Co-Investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the Case for Support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration.
Irish applicants:
The Irish Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the Irish Research Council’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the Digital Humanities field.
Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date.
In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the Irish Research Council before the award’s commencement.
There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified.

Mapping the Scottish Reformation – A database of the Scottish clergy, 1560 to 1689 contains data extracted from over ten thousand pages of manuscript evidence housed in the National Records of Scotland, this website offers researchers powerful new tools to trace the careers of around seven hundred Scottish clergymen and almost five hundred of their wives from Lothian and Tweeddale (the region surrounding Edinburgh) between 1560 and 1689. Each map view offers users a hitherto unavailable set of tools to refine their research questions. By showing users full manuscript references, researchers can use the website as a starting point for their research into the rich and complex archival records at the National Records of Scotland and maps provided by the National Library of Scotland and the historical maps API. The ISG staff who did the web/data work are Stewart Cromar, Hristo Meshinski and Ewan McAndrew. The project is  an international collaboration led at Edinburgh University by Professor Jane E. A. Dawson and Professor Julian Goodare.

"The Digital Classroom: A Digital Humanities Primer on Tools, Methods, and Resources | American Studies Journal","ISSN 2199-7268 This article will focus on teaching with digital humanities (DH) methods and tools as they relate to their practicability in the context of the classroom. It will concentrate on the specific challenges that the teaching of computational methods pose to educators who are experts in their discipline but might feel that they lack the technical know-how to steer their students towards DH. In particular, the article will introduce a number of tools that allow school students and educators to access digital approaches and to start appreciating their relevance for research. These include online resources for literary analysis, simple programs that may be used for research into media, and archival projects that stem from the collaboration of students and staff and bring neglected histories to an outside audience. While these tools do not demand any practical programming knowledge, I will also present resources that teach widely used coding languages such as Python and R on a step-by-step basis. The third and final part of the article will introduce a number of methods and services that empower educators to create a digital classroom with quantitative approaches and distant learning as their primary characteristics. Teaching these methods might prove challenging at first.; yet the hands-on, collaborative, quality of DH also leads to classroom situations in which students and staff become co-learners, and therefore leads to a democratizing effect.  Kahoot   Allison, Sarah, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti, Amir Tevel, and Irena Yamboliev.

UCLDH / CESTA / Uppsala Seminar Series | UCL Centre for Digital Humanities - UCL – University College London,"UCL Centre for Digital Humanities  Technology is global, but where we live affects how we apply digital solutions to humanities work. We all have what Roopika Risam described as a digital humanities (DH) “accent”. This seminar series explores those accents by looking at DH research here, and there, and over there too. This is a chance to build greater global awareness and empathy about regional and local approaches to digital humanities in the twenty-first century. It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed differently around the globe, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots. This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon our successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

"Virtual Martin Luther King, Jr. Project – A rhetorical digital humanities project of the ""Fill Up the Jails"" public speech","The Story of the Virtual MLK Project Just days after the start of the Greensboro sit-ins In February 1960, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered what would become a widely influential speech titled, “A Creative Protest.” Despite the historical and rhetorical significance of what is commonly known as the “Fill Up the Jails” speech, no recordings exist. Here, for the first time, using advanced digital and audio technology, we provide an opportunity for scholars, students and citizens to experience and explore this important speech.

Where to Start? On Research Questions in The Digital Humanities | Trevor Owens,"How should digital humanities scholars develop research questions? Spurred on by this recent conversation on twitter, I figured I would lay out a few different ways to go about answering this question about questions. The gist of the dialog is that Jason Heppler suggested that one should “Fit the tool to the question, not the other way around” in terms of working with various kinds of new digital humanities tools. I take tools here to mean any computational instrument employed to understand the world; for examples GIS, topic modeling, creating simulations using cellular automata or agent based models, analyzing frequencies of audio files, or visualizing trends in images. I get where Jason was going, but at least as it was formulated I don’t think it is the right advice. The conversation prompted me to try and clarify a bit of how I see the relationship between research questions, primary sources, and tools and methods. Start with the Question, the Archive or the Tool? Some historians start with their question, some start with a familiarity with a period that suggests that exploration of a particular archive or collection of primary resources could answer. Here are two examples I can recall from colleagues who I worked with doing research in the history of science. One colleague was aware of the shift that had occurred between classical and modern physics in one astronomer’s work, documented in a recent essay. So he went to look at the papers of another astronomer, which had not yet been particularly well explored, to see if similar or different responses to the notion of a distinction between classical and modern physics had emerged in that astronomer’s work. In short, it was largely about abstracting the results of one exploration into the information available in another individuals archive. In either case, it’s a bit of a dance between formation of questions and the ways that those questions open up or shift and change as one gets into the complicated, rich and vast space of the possibilities of primary sources. The Function of Research Questions in History/the Humanities Back up a bit. What is the purpose of research questions in the humanities? I would posit that the purpose of them is to clarify what is in and out of scope in a project. To define where a project should start and end. Lastly, research questions provide a constant point of reference to check back on when working on a project. You write down your questions as you go, and you can always pull them out again and check to see if, in fact, you are actually working to answer them or if you have drifted off to some other problem. Research questions are useful structures to organize your work and inquiry and they are valuable tools for signifying to others what to expect from a piece of scholarship. Research question are functionally an attempt to establish the set of criteria by which a piece of scholarship should be evaluated. The Problem of Research Proposals and Fancy Writing One of the big problems in talking about research questions is that one often describes research questions and methods in research proposals (for grants or dissertations etc.), and those proposals are often really a form of what Joe Maxwell calls “fancy writing.” That is, those kinds of research proposals are more about the performance of demonstrating how smart you are and why you should be given permission to do work than they are about actually trying to get research done. If you haven’t read it, I can’t recommend Joe’s Qualitative Research Design: An Interactive Approach strongly enough. In focusing on the actual purpose of research design and not the performance of proposal writing he cuts through a bunch of the fancy stuff to get to the way that research questions actually develop and evolve. He calls it an interactive approach, but I think iterative would be just as descriptive. In Maxwell’s approach, there are five components of research design as it is actually practiced. The diagram below illustrates how 5 components of design interact Illustration of how research questions should be iteratively defined and developed in relation to goals, conceptual framework, methods, and validity threats. From Maxwell 2014 The main point of the diagram, is that your research questions should be iteratively revised and refined throughout the work based on all the four other things that you are working on. So… research questions aren’t something you state and then follow through on, they are best thought of as statements about your inquiry that are iteratively refined through the process of defining what you are working on. Generally, the way that research questions are stated in quantitative research is bogus, or at least, bogus in terms of the way that people who do more qualitative research think of research questions. That is, you do a lot of work and scholarship before you can ever formulate a hypothesis that you can test. In that case, you end up with a research question at the end of an exploration not at the front of it. Tools, Archives, & Research Questions are Inherently Theory Laden  Getting back to the issue of questions, tools, and sources; being good humanists, it is worth leaning back to grok that all method is theory laden. That is, every attempt to answer a question comes with inherent theoretical assumptions about the problem and limitations in what that method can provide in terms of answers. This is true of method broadly conceived; every method for collecting sources/evidence, the original intent by which records and sources are collected create silences, identifying a problem, interpreting sources, composing and reporting on results, all of that, comes with some inherent biases. That is, all tools, all archives and all research questions are in and of themselves instrumental. We use them in an attempt to understand the world. That is they all serve as lens like tools reflecting and refracting back information in a tool like fashion. I’ve always liked the way that Umberto Eco explains this in Kant and the Platypus as a core concept in hermeneutics; we make interpretations but the underlying reality of existence exerts the force to resist some of those interpretations by simply saying “No” by making it clear that an interpretation can be refuted. A hermeneutics of data that emerges through the use of tools. So where to start? Start wherever, as long as where you start is anchored in your goals. The hermeneutics of screwing around is itself invaluable. A technique of messing with tools and datasets at hand may well surface interesting patterns that no one would have found if they were working at sources in a another fashion. Pick and archive and find the questions. Or, just start with your questions and work it that way. Whatever you do, realize that it’s an exploratory process. What matters most in where you start is your actual goals in doing the research. That is, why is it that you are actually doing your work? What is it that you hope your work will potentially do. Don’t confuse your goals with what you are interested in, realize and recognize that your goals area about the purpose of your work. If you want to do work that ultimately helps to understand and give voice to the voiceless then you likely don’t want to start messing around with the text of inaugural presidential speeches. If you want to figure out new kinds of things that can be done with topic modeling then you would presumably want to start with some sources that are in a form or close to a form that you can topic model. Thanks to Thomas Padilla and Zach Coble who reviewed and provided input on a draft of this post.    I’m glad to see that questions of research are being addressed here in relation to digital tools. I think these are often overlooked in digital projects. I don’t know how many presentations I’ve been to where someone shows off a new tool, or a new database, without a clear sense of what kinds of questions would be made available that weren’t available before. It’s not enough to say that, now that we have a new tool or database, people can ask whatever they want. That doesn’t mean that everything must be worked out in advance – far from it. The questions become clear as you immerse yourself in the area.  It seems to me that questions are the coin of the realm in research. In my own area of philosophy, we’ve often thought of our atomic structure (that is, the irreducible building blocks) as being claims. I’m not sure that’s true. I think it’s well-asked questions. This may be why there are relatively fewer philosophers doing digital humanities projects than there are other disciplines – philosophers have yet to be convinced as to the value of the digital for asking new philosophical questions. I think they often just don’t give it a chance, and don’t explore much, but the issue remains – each discipline has a set of questions that it recognizes as its own, and some have done a better job of figuring out how digital tools and environments can help to refine/change/advance those questions than others.

Digital humanities in the K-12 classroom - NEO BLOG,"In my previous post we explored the origins and definitions of digital humanities and covered a few examples of how the techniques are being applied in higher education. Today, I’d like to look at ways the K-12 teacher can utilize some of the very exciting techniques and tools of digital humanities in their classrooms. The suggestion when it comes to dabbling in DH (Digital Humanities) in the classroom is to take an exploratory, curious and light approach. Don’t try to tackle all of the concepts and techniques in one go, but rather allow your students to “play” with the tools. In that vein I will list a few tools and inspiring projects as a soft guide to your class’s DH journey. Enjoy, and don’t forget to let me know your DH thoughts and experiences in the comments. StoryMap is a tool developed by Knight Labs of North Western University. In true DH-style, it brings designers, developers and journalists together to develop tools that bring stories to life. The software allows users to plot out events across a geography — it gives visual aides to any narrative, be it fictional, historical or personal. From a Digital Humanities point of view, it uses technology to further visualize data, that then enhances both one’s ability to comprehend the narrative, as well as share it. Another useful part of the tool is that students can build the story maps together. (Ever struggled to follow Arya’s (rather complicated) journey through the Game of Thrones? Wonder no longer as there’s a Story Map for that!) Of course applications such as these are probably too technical for younger students, however story maps remain an important tool assisting younger students to “map” out storylines, characters and places in a story. There are a number of analogue printables aides online that will help elementary school teachers bring a new dimension to story-time. Story maps have also been shown to assist comprehension in other areas such as math (where students use the aide to break-down the problem into smaller pieces), social studies and science (where the narrative of an experiment is broken down into its composite pieces and actors). Google also has great story mapping software, called My Maps. Students can collaborate using the software to create both historical and contemporary maps, adding layers that could include images, links, videos, graphics and small descriptions. Naturally because it uses “real” maps it is not necessarily adaptable to fictional environments — for that the Story Maps app is more flexible. Some teachers have found useful ways to include My Maps as a station in their blended learning classrooms, where each student contributes to one map as they cycle through the stations. Read more: 4 Models of blended learning to implement in the classroom N-what? An N-gram is a “word unit”, so it could either be a phrase, a word or only part of a word, such as the “i” in iPod, iMac etc. Ngrams are used by linguists to chart or map word and phrase usage within specific texts, as well as across whole swathes of literature. The frequency of ngrams can tell scholars a lot about the emergence of trends within society, the spread of knowledge, and indeed even the emergence of bias, fake news and beliefs. Now the fun part. Google has developed an Ngram Viewer that searches for whichever ngram you input, across all of the books the search engine has scanned, currently standing at about 25 million of what Google estimates to be 130 million total books. Books scanned so far include publications from between 1500 – 2000 and include English, Chinese (simplified), French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. At first the Ngram Viewer may appear dull to the average student — it’s literally a line graph, but once you start playing around with it, it becomes increasingly engaging. For instance my name, Susannah, enjoyed a highpoint of popularity in 1904. For other fun examples of how ngrams can reveal trends, usage and indeed history itself perhaps start with the Ngram info page. The varieties of graphs that can be produced by the viewer can, in fact, be overwhelming. Once again, perhaps explore it alongside your students using the following ideas as a jumping off point: GapMinder is an epic non-profit data-based project that moves from the basic premise that nobody really knows the real facts about the world. Founded on typical DH values such as open-source software, social awareness, collaborative data collection and tool development the foundation has, in the last 15 years, developed a wonderful array of data visualization tools that give true insight into how other people live, bringing vast data sets to life with relevance and a timely sense of urgency. Read more: A call for more visual learning elements in schools For starters their GapMinder Tools allow users to find maps and charts demonstrating statistics from around the world across a wide variety of subsets. Ever wondered how Math achievement among fourth graders has changed across the world between 1997 and 2013? Looking for an animation showing how aid per capita has increased the median life expectancy in the world? These tools will find that chart, delivering an animated starting point for fact-based, yet engaging lessons on anything from healthcare and infrastructure, to unemployment and education. A second inspired project from GapMinder is what they call Dollar Street. Dollar Street is a visualization of the globe’s socio-economic profile, as if each country was a household on a single street. Using community captured data, and real stories, from real families, this tool and data-base has a wealth of accurate information that will give your students a real world-view of how other people live. A good place to start with Gapminder is their Teacher page. Digital Humanities is delivering incredible tools and techniques to help students understand their world a bit better, and in the process deepening their understanding of society, history, language and culture. The tools are typically easy to use, and can be adapted across grades and subjects — a true blend of technology and pedagogy delivering platforms for real insight as well as demystifying how data can reveal true knowledge. Susannah has years of writing experience. She would have liked to be forever a student, but life had other things in mind. So NEO is the perfect place for her to address topics about e-learning and ed-tech for schools. We’ll keep you updated with the most valuable E-learning tips and resources.

Turning the Page,"Emory’s leadership in digital publishing and open access expands the scope and reach of new humanities scholarship By Senta Scarborough | Jan. 14, 2021 A groundbreaking effort within Emory College of Arts and Sciences brings books by humanities faculty to wider audiences through open access publication, making the works freely available online to anyone in the world with internet access. Supported by Emory’s Digital Publishing in the Humanities initiative, university presses have published seven open access scholarly books, or monographs, by Emory faculty since 2018. Four more are forthcoming by 2022. “This initiative increases the impact of scholarship in the humanities — and allows our faculty to cultivate new audiences for their research — while also positioning Emory as a leader in the creative expansion of open access digital publishing,” says Emory College Dean Michael A. Elliott, who is the principal investigator for the $1.2 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that funds the digital publishing initiative.  The scope in scholarship spans the subjects of molecular feminism, early Soviet Union architecture, Korean letter writing, standup feminist comedy, segregated Jim Crow era psychiatric hospitals, race and food origins in the early United States, and others.   “What drives me and most faculty is the dissemination of our research and discoveries. This (open access) is going to reach a bigger audience than if you required it to be purchased,” says Jacob Wright, associate professor of Hebrew Bible in Emory’s Candler School of Theology. Within days of publication this summer, Wright’s newest book had thousands of online views. “War, Memory, and National Identity in the Hebrew Bible” (published several months ago with Cambridge University Press) has a global market, making open access optimal for students and scholars. It’s particularly important for Wright’s international Coursera students. “For a student, say, in Bangladesh to buy a book on a Bible causes political problems. Students all across the world can go online privately without having to order something and be watched for what they are reading. And it’s free,” says Wright.  Jacob Wright, associate professor, Candler School of Theology Jacob Wright, associate professor, Candler School of Theology   Elizabeth Wilson, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Elizabeth Wilson, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Another scholarly benefit is open access simply makes research easier, says Elizabeth Wilson, a Samuel Candler Dobbs professor and director of undergraduate studies in the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies department. “In doing research, I can pull up a book and, in a minute, find the quote I am searching after. The searchability function is really important. I don’t have to plow through a book looking for these things,” says Wilson. Her book, “A Silvan Tomkins Handbook: Foundations for Affect Theory” (University of Minnesota Press), published in August, not only has academic appeal but is a useful guide for psychologists and clinics.    Lauren Klein, associate professor, Department of English and Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods Lauren Klein, associate professor, Department of English and Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods  Monographs are often written for scholars in a particular field, and engage in field-specific conversation. That specificity narrows the audience, but not the relevancy to other disciplines, says Lauren Klein, director of Emory’s Digital Humanities Lab and an associate professor of English and quantitative theory and methods. “An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States” (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) is her monograph digitally published in May. These books are part of Emory’s commitment to open access through TOME, Toward an Open Monograph Ecosystem, where universities pledge to subsidize digital publication. “The TOME project is geared towards these scholarly books that are the gold standard in humanities disciplines, and because of that — the institutional and disciplinary pressures — it’s hard to get a broader audience without external mechanisms like funding,” Klein says.   Unlike its academic counterpart, the sciences, the humanities are new to the world of open access publishing. Cynthia Willett, a Samuel Candler Dobbs professor of philosophy, didn’t publish digitally until 2019 with her fifth book, “Uproarious: How Feminists and Other Subversive Comics Speak Truth” (University of Minnesota Press). She’s heard from stand-up comics who she doubts would have discovered the book if only printed.  “It broadened the scope of the idea of who the audience would be and that was exciting,” Willett says. “It challenged us and we expanded it.” Monographs are expensive to publish and purchase. Open access publication allows academics and non-academics to give the material a chance.   Cynthia Willett, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy Cynthia Willett, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy    Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty and professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty and professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies   Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty for ECAS and professor of neuroscience and behavioral biology and women’s, gender and sexuality studies, never imagined her book, “Molecular Feminisms: Biology, Becomings, and Life in the Lab” (University of Washington Press, 2018) would be read by artists and architects or be taught interactively with students in Australia. She’s also had an increase in global speaking engagements from Romania to Singapore. “I think open access has had an impact. The international attention to the work is more than I had anticipated,” Roy says. Wright says people need to understand that knowledge isn’t free. Even open access books are expensive to produce.  Costs include the years scholars spend researching and writing, the price of university presses publishing the book, and the “invisible” university expenditures in editorial and technical support.  The Digital Publishing in the Humanities initiative is based in Emory College’s Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry. Collaborators include the Scholarly Communications Office of Emory Libraries, the Center for Faculty Development and Excellence (CFDE) and the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. Together, they create an infrastructure that supports faculty developing digital monographs.  For example, Lisa Macklin, associate dean of research, engagement and scholarly communications in the Emory Libraries, helps authors navigate copyright challenges with university presses, crafting book contracts to meet open access requirements.   Hwisang Cho, assistant professor, Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures  Hwisang Cho, assistant professor, Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures The CFDE provides workshops on public scholarship, funds for developmental editing, and writing groups. Korean studies assistant professor Hwisang Cho received a grant from its Scholarly Writing and Publishing (SWAP) fund for his book, “The Power of the Brush: Epistolary Practices in Chosŏn Korea,” which was published open access in October by the University of Washington Press.  Emory’s project began in 2014 as a faculty working group searching for new models in humanities publishing led by Elliott while he was serving as executive associate dean for Emory College.  In 2016, Emory received a $1.2 million Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant. Under Elliott’s direction, the grant helps university presses offset open access publishing costs while fostering new opportunities for faculty to experiment with digital publishing. Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship “It’s not unusual in the sciences to come to the university with a lab package, but the humanities haven’t had that opportunity,” says Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. “The Mellon grant was encouraging universities to offer subsidies to presses to publish monographs online and demonstrate every university should support its faculty in this way.” So far, Tullos says the grant has “been a success” with scholars increasingly opting for online publishing. Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing, helms the initiative, supporting individual projects and keeping the humanities community informed. “The open access and digital publications landscape is continually evolving, so our hope is to include everyone in the conversation — even those who are not actively working on a digital monograph,” McKee says. The initiative offers workshops and lectures to help spread the word. This fall, the annual Open Access Authors Reception was a virtual celebration, with a new website built to showcase open access works from across the university.   Kylie Smith, Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor of nursing Kylie Smith, Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor of nursing “Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South” won’t be published by the University of North Carolina Press both in print and online for two years. The author, Kylie Smith, an Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor at Emory, didn’t want her book to remain on a shelf. Like other digital book authors supported by Emory, Smith is writing the book traditionally — not posting the book until it is peer reviewed and published. But Smith enters new digital terrain: as she writes and researches, anyone can follow her process online.  She uses the Manifold platform to post blogs about ongoing research, essays and links to other publications. “People get to be part of the journey and be aware that the work is happening,” Smith says. “I can test what works rather than wait.” It has provided early feedback, increased collaboration and accountability, widened her perspective on her work, and expanded her creativity. Her photographs of an abandoned Alabama asylum will be posted as an online essay. “It’s another way of expression to help me in my emotional and thinking process,” Smith says. Smith, with input from her publisher, chose to work with Manifold, a publishing platform developed in collaboration between the University of Minnesota Press and the Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. Manifold allows more interactivity and multimedia than a conventional e-book.  In 2019, Emory participated in a Manifold pilot project to share knowledge and resources. Manifold staff have trained Emory staff and faculty to help show them how to formulate digital projects using its platform. “It was new for us and new for them. Emory has been a great partner for us to learn what is useful and meaningful for an institution — installing and using Manifold with faculty,” says Susan Doerr, an associate director of the University of Minnesota Press. Manifold’s digital flexibility is important to Smith, who wants to “capture the lived experience” of African Americans hospitalized in the poor conditions of psychiatric hospitals during the Jim Crow era in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.  She is working with the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship to find ways to translate her research into an engaging online experience. That innovative digital landscape includes interactive databases, documents, photographs or 3-D tours, maps and charts, videos or other multimedia. “Our goal is to work with the authors and presses to come up with designs and use these platforms to enable new forms of publications,” Tullos says. “The key is collaboration. No one person knows all the technology or the scholarship. It has been quite remarkable and well received.” As a former filmmaker, Smith began recording her interviews. While she was working with Rose Library archives, staff realized her work could fill a gap in their Civil Rights oral history collection. Together, they are creating a special collection called the Southern Mental Health History Project. “Writing a book is an isolating experience: I wouldn’t have ventured down this (digital) path on my own,” Smith says. “Emory is willing to collaborate and support me in resources, time and money. I have a team making this with me. It’s a great feeling.”",https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/01/digital-publishing/index.html
Grants-in-Aid - Arte Publico Press,"The University of Houston US Latino Digital Humanities (USLDH) program is a digital scholarship/research undertaking to provide training and research on US Latino recovered materials. Proposals must draw from recovered primary and derivative sources produced by Latinas/os in what is now the United States, dating from the Colonial Period to 1980 (such as Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage collections, other repositories and/or the community). The Grants-in-Aid program is designed to provide a stipend to scholars for research and development of digital scholarship in the form of a digital publication and/or a digital project. The grant covers any expense connected with research that will advance a project to the next stage or to a successful conclusion. Descriptions of the 2021-22 and 2020-21 grants-in-aid cohorts are listed below. This project seeks to highlight the histories and lived experiences of people of African descent in pre-US California in order to examine the changing ways race has been made in California across various colonial regimes. It will identify, locate and recover historical primary or derivative documents and/or popular culture illustrating the long presence of Afro-Latina/os, Californios of mixed African descent and Black Mexican settlers and citizens (by birth and naturalization) in the regions of Spanish and Mexican Alta California that now comprise US California. The first phase of this project will consist of identifying and digitally mapping the location of relevant archival materials. PI: Caroline Collins, PhD

UC San Diego Tommie Camarillo, Chair of the Chicano Park Steering Committee (CPSC), Stewards of Chicano Park, for over 40 years, has maintained an extensive library/archive of the history of Chicano Park. Chicano Park and the Chicano Park Monumental murals located in Barrio Logan/Logan Heights in San Diego, California is a National Landmark (2016) and listed on the National Register (2013). The archive/library documents a community’s self-determination to defy the City of San Diego and the State of California to build their own park in response to the Intrusion of Interstate 5 and the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge that displaced 75 percent of the residents in less than 14 years. The Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center’s Logan Heights Archival project is to digitize and inventory the Tomasa Camarillo archive/library of Chicano Park and Community history and to highlight a unique archival method embodied in the life of Tommie Camarillo and rooted in community values and empowerment that comes from the heart.

The Festival was a Latina-organized, Latina-led, one-day street festival coordinated by Mujeres Latinas en Acción (MLEA), an important early Latina organization. The Festival provides a window into Chicago’s Mexicana-Chicana feminism in 1979—its individuals, groups and alliances across generations, ethnicities and races.

UC San Diego Co-PI: Diana SolisVisual Artist, Photographer & EducatorChicago, IL[Photo by Lucas Anti] The Latino Catskills is a digital project that resituates the rural Catskills region, located 100 miles northwest of New York City, as a generative space of Latino culture and identities. As this project documents, from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s, the Catskill mountains were a popular summer destination for countless Spaniards, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and others of Latin American descent. These Latino travelers took day trips (known as giras) or stayed at private dwellings and the many resorts owned by fellow Spanish speakers, such as the historic “Villas Hispanas” in Plattekill, New York. Our project reconstructs this important archive of Latino leisure culture through the development of a digital archive and map. By telling the stories of these forgotten sites, the project recenters recreation and leisure as important social components of the Latino experience, complementing dominant narratives of New York Latinidad, which have traditionally focused on the racialized experiences of urban poverty and toil.

Lehman College, CUNY The Música de los cultos africanos en Cuba collection consists of field recordings of music, chants and prayers produced by Lydia Cabrera and Josefina Tarafa in the mid-1950s, along with liner notes and photographs, and it is arguably the single most robust multimedia archive of Afro-Cuban musical traditions in the mid-20th century. Our project will develop an online, open access multimedia platform for the Música de los cultos recordings, creating a digital environment which will make the entire collection available to the public for the first time and establish a collaborative research project based on the recordings. The USLDH grant will support the creation of archival metadata for the collection and a proof of concept for a dynamic digital environment which incorporates the recordings, archival images, manuscripts and ephemera from the Lydia Cabrera Papers of the Cuban Heritage Collection, along with commentary from scholars, artists and priests.

University of Miami Libraries (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas: The Aida Barrera Digital Project highlights Aida Barrera’s career as creator of Carrascolendas. Through a close study of Carrascolendas, a bilingual children’s show produced during the 1970s in Austin, Texas, this digital humanities project demonstrates how Barrera, like other Latinas in the United States, engaged in social activism and contributed to race, gender and labor equality. While contextualizing Carrascolendas within broader histories, this project emphasizes the significance of Barrera’s labor and agency as a Latina in television production during the late twentieth century and examines how the Chicano and Civil Rights Movements influenced her approach to bilingual education. Additionally, (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas contributes to a wider understanding of race, gender, migration and language in the US-Mexico borderlands by underlining the immediate and long-term significance of Carrascolendas for Latino audiences.

Lone Star College-North Harris, Houston El primer número del periódico La voz se publicó en Nueva York en julio de 1937, estableciendo desde su editorial que se trataba de una empresa de intenciones democráticas. La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años. Su trabajo intelectual sirve de base para el estudio de las fuertes conexiones entre feminismo y antifascismo que los artículos de La voz ponen de evidencia.

University of Connecticut #MAOD1889 is defined as the Modesta Avila: Obstructing Development Since 1889 multimedia, digital-arts project. Modesta Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Mexican/Mexican American folks. There are various versions of Modesta Avila's life and the various actions she took in the late 1880s to keep the Santa Fe Railroad from developing on her family's land, which was located in in the same region of what is now the San Juan Capistrano Train Station. The project will trace and focus on Modesta Avila’s life via a virtual timeline, a research contribution to the Recovery Program via their Omeka site and augmented reality. #MAOD1889 builds movement culture by preserving and re-presenting history from a people of color (POC) point of view. Among academic documentation, #MAOD1889 cites relevant photos, historical documents, media publications and urban tales from the community and local POC artists who have focused on Modesta Avila’s mugshot image to produce contemporary work. The archives will be used to source an online and book publication as well as a live hologram presentation. Through the use of the digital humanities, #MAOD1889 will provide readers and researchers the opportunity to scan the images with their phones and witness Modesta Avila come to life to tell her own story.

University of California-Berkeley The Puerto Rican Literature Project is a digital archive that maps the literary production of Puerto Rican writers from the archipelago and the diaspora since the Jones Act. It contains various photos, ephemera, and images of manuscripts in progress, some of which are housed at the archive at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, where a portion of this project began at a summer fellowship. In addition, we are creating various free digital teaching aids that educators can use to teach Puerto Rican literature in the classroom. Finally, the project will feature a page documenting the work of contemporary Puerto Rican writers through interviews, scholarly essays, craft talks, and book reviews.

92Y's Unterberg Poetry Center This project emphasizes the recovery of Ramírez’s maternal abuela’s writings. Her abuela, doña Ramona González, was born in El Paso, Texas in 1906 and wrote short stories, poems, fables, dichos, and more in 1960 – 1975. As an early Chicana writer, she published some of her writings in the important Chicano literary journal of El Grito’s (1967-1974) special issue Chicanas en la literatura y el arte of 1973. This project, however, focuses on doña Ramona’s seven hundred and fifty plus primary documents that she produced over her lifetime. Five years ago, the González/Hernández family (Ramírez’s immediate family) uncovered these documents tucked away in a cardboard box. These documents have now all been digitized, and a large majority have been translated by Dr. Ramírez’s father, Dr. Neil J. Devereaux. This project’s main goal is community accessibility of these primary document to the greater Latinx community. The Ramona González Papers Exhibit: The Ramona González Papers PI: Cristina Ramírez, PhD

"UCLDH ONLINE: From Engagement to Retreat? Historians and Digital Preservation, 1968-2003 | UCL Centre for Digital Humanities - UCL – University College London","UCL Centre for Digital Humanities 
              27 January 2021, 5:00 pm–7:00 pm             Ian Milligan (Uni of Waterloo) explores the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Despite the professional caricature of historians being uninterested in technology, historians have had a long track record of engaging with born-digital sources. This has necessarily involved critical conversations around digital preservation and access. These early encounters were driven by a wave of digitally-aware historians in the 1960s and 1970s, who were then then relatively central within the historical profession. The interdisciplinary journal Computers and the Humanities was established in 1966, and indeed, by 1970 the prospects for “computer-assisted historical projects” suggested the possibility of a wholescale transformation of the discipline. This current peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. At the same time, archivists and librarians were exploring digital preservation in earnest. During these first conversations about electronic records, historians played a prominent role at the table, helping to shape the conversation. This interdisciplinary engagement helped to shape early digital preservation efforts. Conversations would continue into the web age, with impact on this turn to networked information. By the mid-1990s, a small group of economic historians – tracing their lineage back to these early encounters – would help underscore the need for digital preservation and source stewardship. Their arguments presaged contemporary ones around computational history, forming an essential part of the historical context for any history of the digital humanities in general and digital history specifically. Yet, by the late 1990s (with some exceptions), historians largely disappeared from the conversation – unfortunately at a time when they were needed more than ever. In this presentation, part of my broader project “Averting the Digital Dark Age,” I explore the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Electronic records, to these historians, imperilled society’s collective memory. What was to be done?

Drawing on my experience co-editing the volume The Digital Black Atlantic for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series (University of Minnesota Press) with Kelly Baker Josephs, this talk explores the challenges of putting postcolonial digital humanities into practice by producing a volume on African diaspora digital humanities. From series editors who struggled to see the difference between our proposed volume on the digital black Atlantic and another proposed volume on global digital humanities to difficult editorial choices we encountered, the process of assembling the volume raised the critical question of how “the digital” travels throughout the African diaspora, changing and being changed by local contexts for digital knowledge production. The roots and routes of the digital in the African diaspora - from Nigeria to Dominica to South Africa to the United States to Jamaica and on - offer a critical transformation of digital humanities praxis that, I argue, is a practice of cultural survival necessary to ensuring a central place for the African diaspora in the digital cultural record.

The case of Tholos IV at the Palace of Nestor In 1953 Lord William Taylour directed the excavation of a monumental vaulted tholos tomb known as ‘Tholos IV’, a stone’s throw away from the later discovered and infamous ‘Griffin Warrior Grave’ at the site of ancient Pylos, Messenia, Greece. The excavation was conducted over two months, from which detailed notes were recorded in three notebooks now kept in the Archives of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The formal publication of Tholos IV, however, contains only a basic narrative of the excavation, offering neither precise detail on stratigraphy, object find spots, nor even a complete inventory of small finds. The present study rebuilds virtually Taylour’s excavation, combining data from the original notebooks with a new digital survey of Tholos IV. A comprehensive and accurate 3D GIS model for Taylour’s excavation has now been built that lets one wind back the discovery of the tomb. Furthermore, the GIS has been produced in such a way that its dataset is directly comparable with new excavation data currently generated in the ongoing Palace of Nestor Excavations (PONEX) project. Discussion follows on how the production of this GIS deepens our understanding not just of the legacy excavation, but also of the site and its wider landscape. To view Dr Loy’s talk, please  here.  Thursday 18th March, 5pm Open to all, via Zoom (please email k.l.mcdonald@exeter.ac.uk for the link) Dr Daisy Dunn In a Nutshell: The World According to Pliny Pliny the Elder – historian, statesman, and tragic victim of the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 – left behind the most remarkable account of the world in the shape of his encyclopaedia of Natural History. Covering everything from the habits of elephants to the perils of oysters, the book makes for particularly fascinating reading today as we refocus our efforts on protecting the environment. In this original talk, author Dr Daisy Dunn – winner of the 2020 Classical Association Prize – offers an entertaining tour through this most surprising of ancient books, uncovering observations to inspire – and to puzzle – as we seek to draw closer to nature.  Daisy Dunn is an author and classicist. Her books include In the Shadow of Vesuvius: A Life of Pliny, Of Gods and Men: 100 Stories from Ancient Greece and Rome, Homer: A Ladybird Expert Book, Catullus’ Bedspread: The Life of Rome’s Most Erotic Poet and The Poems of Catullus: A New Translation.  Wednesday 28th April, 5pm Open to all, via Zoom (please email k.l.mcdonald@exeter.ac.uk for the link) Dr Dan Diffendale (American Academy in Rome) The Stones that Rome was Built With (during the Monarchy and Republic) The city of Rome was already populated with temples and other monuments centuries before the introduction of those stereotypical Roman building materials, concrete and marble. As early as the 6th century BCE, Roman builders began to exploit the natural resources of the city’s volcanic landscape, quarrying a variety of local tuffs to use as building stone. Developing scientific techniques allow these stones to be traced to their quarries of origin in and around Rome. The results of these analyses indicate a higher degree of architectural and economic sophistication among early Roman builders than previously understood, and they suggest some new ways of understanding the work of Roman laborers.

 Recommend it Silke Schwandt, Universität Bielefeld, Deutschland 1. Why did you choose this topic? I have been working in the field of Digital Humanities for quite some time and one of the biggest challenges was always to find projects willing to embark on the - often complicated - journey of implementing computational methods in the humanities. So I decided to make a book about the challenges, but also the ideas and perspectives that lie in wait for those who do engage with digital humanities methods. I am grateful to all contributors for letting other researchers in on their experiences. 2. What new perspectives does your book offer? The books offers a unique insight into the everyday practices of a big cooperative project with its organizational challenges as well as the chances and opportunities such collaborations yield. Every article speaks from its own disciplinary perspective, which allows us to evaluate the impact of digital research methods in different humanities disciplines. 3. What makes your topic relevant for current research debates? The field of Digital Humanities is evolving quickly and some see it as an emerging discipline in its own right within the humanities. Its genuinely interdisciplinary nature works against that, though, and our book shows this by highlighting the disciplinary gains through computational methods, but also pointing out the different challenges and theoretical as well as methodological critiques that come from the various research fields the authors represent. 4. Choose one person you would like to discuss your book with! That is a difficult question. But I guess I would like to discuss it with my father who had nothing to do with academia but who believed in me and was always supportive of my endeavors big and small. This book certainly bears witness to that. Within academia, I would like to discuss this with any humanities scholar who is still reluctant about the digital turn and hear his or her reasons. I might just be able to convince them otherwise. 5. Your book summary in one sentence: Digital Methods in the Humanities is a tour guide for the journey into Digital Humanities providing practical insights as well as warnings about the pitfalls along the way.

Specifcally, Swanstrom addresses works which allow nature to correspond with humans in a shared environment, posing provocative questions about the idea of agency itself as expressed in an ecology of action.

This essay is excerpted from Swanstrom's monograph, Animal, Vegetable, Digital: Experiments in New Media Aesthetics and Environmental Poetics (under contract to be published by the University of Alabama Press).   Mark C. Marino explains the rationale for the Critical Code Studies Working Group, a six-week experiment in using social media for collaborative academic production. Marino also analyzes the first week's discussion, which focused on debates about what it means to read ""code as text."" Entering the 'cyberdebates' initiated by Nick Montfort, John Cayley, and Rita Raley, new media scholar Mark Marino proposes that we should analyze and explicate code as a text like any other, 'a sign system with its own rhetoric' and cultural embeddedness.

"Feminism, Activism, and the Digital Humanities: An Interview with Danica Savonick | HASTAC","Fostering innovative and open methods and tools in the classroom and beyond. Expanding the scope and impact of traditional and digital humanities for the contemporary world. Thinking critically about the role and design of technology, data and the social sciences in our lives and learning. Promoting openness, access, and diversity in technology, and education in service of an equitable society. Promoting change in schools, museums, libraries, and other organizations. Advocating for new forms of scholarly communications, including blogging, multimedia, open publishing, and academic journals and presses. I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Danica Savonick over the phone on May 18, 2020. I am grateful for her time and energy towards this project and especially appreciate the opportunity to elevate her important insights about the transformative power and potential risks of using digital technologies in the classroom. As the pandemic ravages on, her considerations here remain all too relevant as teachers continue to adapt to the online classroom while working to equip students with the critical thinking skills necessary to grapple with this historical moment.  Rebekah Aycock: How did you come into the field of digital humanities? Danica Savonick: Well, I think like a lot of us I came into the field indirectly.  In 2012, when I began grad school, I was involved in some organizing, especially organizations coming out of the Occupy Wall Street movement. With Occupy Sandy we were trying to help out in the aftermath of the hurricane that had devastated the city and we were trying to get resources to people who needed them. I was also involved with the Free University of New York City where we would host pop-up universities throughout the city, and professors from Columbia, NYU, CUNY, The New School, and Rutgers would come and hold their classes outside in these parks alongside activists and local community organizers who taught workshops and skillshares. With this organizing, I was interested in the behind-the-scenes ways that we were using technology. I worked with the website and social media and became interested in the power of platforms to get the word out and spread awareness about things, and also how tools allowed us to collaborate on large projects. Through these activist efforts, we used technology to bring people together, share resources, and support marginalized communities. I became interested in how technologies can be used to do good in society.  I also pursued a PhD at the CUNY Graduate Center where there was a lively digital humanities community. The majority of the DH I was exposed to was people using technology for activist purposes, and to support pedagogy, students, and advocacy for marginalized communities. I was really excited by Cathy Davidson’s arrival at CUNY. She brought HASTAC and started the Futures Initiative, programs dedicated to equity and innovation in higher education. So it wasn’t necessarily the kind of distance-reading version of the digital humanities, it was exploring how we can use technology in service to social change.  The last key moment that I’ll mention was that I went to a summer HILT workshop (Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching) organized by Roopika Risam and micha cárdenas on de/postcolonial digital humanities. That gave me broader exposure to these activist traditions of digital humanities - people who were using technology to do feminist, anti-racist, queer, post-colonial research.  RA: How did being involved with the HASTAC community contribute to your graduate education and now your career?  DS: HASTAC changed everything. There’s no way I would be where I am today were it not for HASTAC. I started as a HASTAC scholar, writing blog posts, contributing to collections like The Pedagogy Project, and attending HASTAC conferences. Participating in this kind of online scholarly community raised new questions for me. How does a blog post differ from a peer-reviewed journal article? How can we write about complex research in a way that is exciting and engaging and will keep someone wanting to read even if they are exhausted after a long day of teaching? For decades, famous feminists like Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, and Toni Cade Bambara have been urging readers, writers, and publishers to consider the material conditions that underscore reading, writing, thinking, and teaching. Readers might work multiple jobs, maybe they have a family, maybe they can only read for a few minutes here and there. All of that is to say that HASTAC has taught me a lot about audience.  HASTAC also gave me the sense that my research was in conversation with audiences beyond my graduate program and even beyond my discipline. This interdisciplinary audience forces you not to use jargon and also to try to provide vivid, tangible examples to support your points. Writing is kind of like teaching in that sense, right? Students aren’t going to believe something is true because you say it, you have to provide them compelling evidence and examples without jargon. ________________________________________________________________________ ""...when students have a sense that their words are going to be read by someone beyond the classroom, that a student in another college classroom might be reading it, then it’s going to actually have an impact and they’re more motivated to create something that they are proud of and that they care about."" ________________________________________________________________________ HASTAC also impacted my teaching. Every semester now my courses conclude not with a final paper that’s submitted only to me but with some kind of public project or blog post that can be read by audiences beyond our classroom. Sometimes this takes the form of an actual post on HASTAC. Stephen Berg, a member of the HASTAC community, created a group called Scholarly Voices within HASTAC to showcase undergraduate writing. Students can read the work of other undergraduates and then write their own post for that group. I’ve been so excited by the ways that these kinds of public writing assignments increase the quality of student writing. Sometimes when students are only submitting something for the professor it can feel tedious, like, “Why are you torturing me? Why are you making me revise these sentences over and over and over again?” But when students have a sense that their words are going to be read by someone beyond the classroom, that a student in another college classroom might be reading it, then it’s going to actually have an impact and they’re more motivated to create something that they are proud of and that they care about.  HASTAC has also taught me about the importance of networks and communities. I came to realize that for those of us who are interested in teaching and social change, part of that activism is sharing what has worked well for us in our own classrooms so that other people in other classrooms and contexts can learn them and build off of that. It's interesting how a contemporary online network like HASTAC has shaped my archival and historical research on feminist pedagogy. For decades, scholars, activists, and teachers have created these kinds of teaching communities and shared resources, syllabi, lesson plans, and assignments. They’ve reflected on their teaching and written about what works, as well as other failures and missteps along the way. My research only goes back to the 60s and 70s - I’m sure you could find activist communities going much farther back than that. RA: How can the digital humanities gain greater legitimacy in traditional academic spaces? How does this work count, or not, when often it’s not taken as seriously or is seen as supplemental, or it just doesn’t get recognized by the usual metrics evaluating scholarly work?  DS:  I think that institutions need to shift what counts as knowledge. Katina Rogers’ recent book Putting the Humanities PhD to Work argues that expanding what we value and what we reward as scholarship can make higher education more equitable, inclusive, engaged, and responsive to the needs of diverse communities. The Torn Apart/Separados project always comes to mind as an example of what engaged, transformative, digital scholarship can look like.  RA: I really loved your piece “Timekeeping as Feminist Pedagogy.” It was something I could relate to as a student and brought up concerns I’ve tried to address as a teacher - thinking about our responsibility to actively make space for student contributions. How do you think the digital humanities can serve as a radical feminist space for teachers? DS: I love that question. In some ways, digital humanities is bringing attention to some of the things that feminists have actually been doing and saying for years. At least in terms of feminist pedagogy, something that may seem new - like having students do a collaborative, public project instead of a paper - has roots in feminist and anti-racist activism.  For years, intersectional, Black, and women of color feminists have been exploring how women and people of color have historically produced knowledge in ways that have not necessarily gotten to count as legitimate or important and that have not been valued by academic institutions. I think of Alice Walker’s essay ""In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens"" and how gardening and quilting have been key artforms for Black women. I also think of Barbara Christian’s ""The Race for Theory,"" which looks at how Black women’s creative, intellectual work - plays, poems, songs, and stories - hasn’t gotten to count as theory. All of that applies to academia as well. We don’t all think and produce knowledge in the format of a scholarly monograph. I think it’s a feminist project to expand what counts as research, in classrooms and at every other scale of the institution. Digital humanities has brought attention to the fact that research can take the format of a timeline, or a website, or a podcast, something that Black, intersectional, and women of color feminists have been saying for many years now.  Another example: Since at least the 1960s, activist educators have been developing assignments that challenge students to write for different audiences and communities. For example, author, activist and “cultural worker” Toni Cade Bambara told students “do not write term papers for me… make sure they are useful for someone else as well” and would suggest formats, such as a magazine, puppet show, annotated bibliography, or activist event on campus.  ________________________________________________________________________ ""At its best, digital platforms can help us nurture students’  activist sensibilities: that idea that when you see something that is missing, when you see a problem in society, how can you use whatever skills, resources, knowledge that you have access to in order to address that problem in some way?"" ________________________________________________________________________ This resonates with contemporary digital humanities pedagogy. Cathy Davidson writes really well about having students make a public contribution to knowledge. At its best, digital platforms can help us nurture students’ activist sensibilities: that idea that when you see something that is missing, when you see a problem in society, how can you use whatever skills, resources, knowledge that you have access to in order to address that problem in some way? As someone who works at the intersection of feminist pedagogy and digital humanities, I often think of that as my job: helping students figure out where are the gaps, where are the omissions in dominant narratives in society, what information is missing? How can I help students develop a project that is interesting and meaningful, that makes an impact not only on them as learners but on audiences and communities beyond the classroom? RA: With the current situation with Covid-19, which has really exacerbated disparities across the board as we’re increasingly dependent on online spaces, how do you see the digital humanities stepping in in the coming months?  DS: I think scholars who have been warning us about the dangers of proprietary educational technologies are especially important right now. I teach a course called ""Digital Divides: Race, Class, and Gender in the Age of the Internet"" and we spend a lot of time talking about how digital technologies often exacerbate existing inequalities in society, but also how they can be used to promote equity. I’m thinking here of figures like Jesse Stommel and everyone involved with Hybrid Pedagogy, Erin Glass and the Ethical EdTech project, Safiya Noble’s Algorithms of Oppression, everything by Audrey Watters, and Chris Gilliard and Hugh Culik’s work on digital redlining. Universities spend a lot of money to make sure students aren’t cheating on tests, but those technologies often discriminate and are grounded in surveillance and policing. Instead, we should invest in creative, meaningful, and exciting assignments that help students develop transferable skills like collaboration.  I think we have much to learn from those who have been teaching engaged, student-centered, transformative, activist online classes for decades: people like Lee Skallerup Bessette and the members of FemTechNet. This pandemic has also shown us how important it is to have networks like HASTAC where people can share ideas and resources and information quickly, when academia is not at all known for its speed. As we abruptly moved online last spring, HASTAC helped circulate Brandon Bayne’s “adjusted syllabus,” Jacqueline Wernimont’s “Resources for Those About to Start Teaching Online Due to Covid 19,"" and has since served as a space for us to share strategies for online teaching. What do you think?  RA: Well, I feel what you’re saying, and I’m just very grateful to be in a department that understands and is trying to, imperfectly, put a lot of these things into practice. It’s hard to reckon with online teaching normally, let alone right now. Now is so not the time to prove a point about rigor or productivity. This is an opportunity to put a lot of what we teach in American Studies into practice. If we really do believe that disparities, like with race and gender, exist, if we say we take all of that seriously and it doesn’t resonate in our response to moving online, then it doesn’t mean much of anything. So I think what we pull from DH should be about these creative responses, but not in an attempt to recreate or add to the burdens of students or teachers.  I did finally want to ask about your book manuscript. Could you share some about that project? DS: Yeah, definitely. I’m completing a manuscript Insurgent Knowledge: The Poetics and Pedagogy of Toni Cade Bambara, June Jordan, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich in the Era of Open Admissions. In the late 1960s, amidst the height of the Women’s Movement, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, and protests against the Vietnam War, these authors were teaching down the hall from one another at Harlem’s City College. Through archival research on their syllabi, lesson plans, and assignments, the project explores the reciprocal relations between teaching and writing in their work. I’m interested in the ways they drew on their activism and work as writers to develop creative methods of teaching students to advocate for social change, and the ways that their work with students impacted their writing. I’m also interested in their advocacy for public higher education.  ________________________________________________________________________ ""...for these writers, teaching was a meaningful form of intellectual, creative, and political work, deeply related to their writing. I’m hoping that by sharing some of their stories, we can think more deeply about the collective value of learning, not just for individuals, but for the collective flourishing of our society."" ________________________________________________________________________ I do think there’s a real devaluation of teaching in our society. It’s seen as the less important thing that professors do and is often treated as secondary to research. But for these writers, teaching was a meaningful form of intellectual, creative, and political work, deeply related to their writing. I’m hoping that by sharing some of their stories, we can think more deeply about the collective value of learning, not just for individuals, but for the collective flourishing of our society.    Danica Savonick, PhD is an Assistant Professor of English at SUNY Cortland, where she teaches courses on multicultural literature, feminism, and digital humanities.  Rebekah Aycock is a PhD Candidate in American Studies at the University of Kansas.

Planning your DH Institute: What and Why | The National Endowment for the Humanities,"Alert for Individual Applicants: Grants.gov & Deadline Extensions Flamingoes, study folder for the book Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom by Abbott Handerson Thayer. Smithsonian American Art Museum This is the first of three posts (post 2  | post 3 ) written to help you conceptualize and describe your Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities. Note: This was originally published in 2020. It has been updated for the 2021 application cycle.   The concept behind the Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities (IATDH) program is simple.   These awards provide funds for digital humanists of all kinds to bring people together with the goal of learning about advanced methodological or conceptual approaches to DH, and building community among practitioners with shared interests. Defining the format for an IATDH is up to you. An IATDH might be organized around a disciplinary theme (like archaeology), a technical problem (like GIS), or a methodological challenge (like Indigenous DH). It might be held as a residential three-week summer institute, a series of three-day workshops, or a hybrid multi-year program with in-person and virtual components. It might be taught or attended by advanced graduate students, faculty members, librarians, technical experts, or other humanities professionals. Our goal with these blog posts, then, is not to tell you how to organize your IATDH. Instead, we want to encourage you to consider proposing an IATDH, and to provide insight into what happens to proposals as they go through the review process. We want to draw your attention to how the review criteria connect to your proposal, and to patterns that we have observed after reading hundreds of pages of aggregated peer review feedback. With this first post, we’ll be focusing on the Significance and the Curriculum and Work Plan sections of the grant proposal, and talking about them in terms of the following review criteria: You can find a full explanation of the review criteria in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate the project’s intellectual significance for the humanities. To consider how this is done, let’s look at an example from the first section of the application for Early Modern Digital Agendas, a 2013 IATDH from the Folger Shakespeare Library: Recent debates concerning Digital Humanities (DH) have raised major methodological and epistemological issues at the core of DH approaches to literature. Yet most scholars of early modern literature recognize that they cannot return to a point before digital technologies; they need to acquire digital literacy. What makes this an effective statement of intellectual significance for the humanities? It identifies a need (digital literacy) within a humanities-specific discipline (early modern literature), and shows how the institute will address that need. Emphasizing the humanities significance is particularly important for programs that focus on a technical area, like cartography, text encoding, or big data analysis. Readers want to know that you will be pushing the humanities forward with your institute. If a proposal is too focused on skill building, absent a clear sense of its applicability to the questions and concerns of humanities scholars and professionals, reviewers may mark it down. Other areas that reviewers highlight when evaluating the significance of a program include: the relevance of the topic for the intended audience, the need for the program given the current landscape of professional development opportunities, and programmatic attention to long-term impact. Here’s how the Early Modern Digital Agendas proposal addressed those topics: Early Modern Digital Agendas seeks to create a forum in which participants can historicize, theorize, and critically evaluate current and future digital tools and approaches in early modern studies, with discussion growing out of, and feeding back into, their own projects. As part of a culminating digital footprint, the participants will produce a DH resources hub for early modernists. In addition to humanities significance, reviewers look for both quality and clarity of expression when reviewing the significance section, which should be accessible to an audience of non-expert readers: reviewers express concern if the language seems overly technical or esoteric. At the same time, reviewers express concern when they feel like a project has not been fully conceptualized. This may occur when the relationship between the goals of the institute and the curriculum has not been clearly articulated, or when reviewers are not convinced that the structure of the institute best suited to accomplish the program’s goals. Reviewers want to see consistency among the needs being met, the community being served, and the pedagogical approach being taken. Return applicants should take note that this section now encompasses what was formerly two sections: the ""curriculum"" and ""work plan."" New for 2021, your narrative description will be supplemented by a required detailed work plan and schedule, to be attached separately in Attachment 3: Work plan and course outline. Note that the comments here refer specifically to the narrative section, but may also apply to Attachment 3. Also new to this section for 2021 is a request for information about planning for changes in your institute once the project is underway.  As we have all learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, you must have a Plan B and we want to you to describe your strategies in your application. So you will need to identify any risks that may occur, such as staff attrition and travel restrictions, and note how they might adversely affect the overall schedule. For example, could you move from an in-person to an online institute to mitigate these risks? Applicants may take a number of different approaches to describing their curriculum in the narrative section. For example, Early Modern Digital Agendas offered a day-by-day overview of the planned institute, including the topics of study and names of guest speakers. In contrast, in the application for the Digital Methods for Military History, a 2020-2021 institute, the proposers provided a brief overview of the general organizational structure, and included a detailed schedule as an appendix. In other cases, we have seen the ""curriculum"" used to describe a pedagogical philosophy or approach. Because the ""curriculum"" section is also where the institute’s organizational structure is described, reviewers look here for an explanation of why you decided to hold, say, a one-week residential institute, or a multi-year virtual program. While there are many, many ways to organize an institute, the key is communicating how your decisions were made, and how they will help participants to achieve the institute’s goals. For example, in the case of one successful proposal, a reviewer remarked that the institute was well thought out and attentive to best practices in digital pedagogy. In another case, a reviewer lauded the proposal’s serious attention to the specific pedagogical needs of the intended participant group. Reviewers express concern when they feel that the way the institute will be carried out is unclear, and they sometimes have questions about specific features, like why a lecture was offered instead of a hands-on session, or whether there’s enough time scheduled for community development or creative experimentation. (Pro tip: when we get feedback from program organizers at the end of an institute, they also often express regret that they didn’t schedule more time for community development and creative experimentation.) Reviewers will also identify gaps in a curriculum; for example, reviewers often express concern when an institute offers technical skills without building in time to focus on the ethical challenges of a particular tool or approach. But without question, the most common concern that reviewers express is when a curriculum appears to be overloaded. Reviewers will take note if the curriculum seems to be covering too many topics, or if the schedule looks overly busy. The answer here, as is so often the case, is to develop focused, achievable plans. When it comes to teaching, less is almost always more! The ""work plan"" is where you describe the steps involved in organizing and running your institute. Based on feedback from past IATDH organizers, we can say that these are labor-intensive programs that require careful planning and implementation. Some aspects of the work plan that were included in the successful 2019 Further Expanding Communities of Practice proposal, for example, include hiring an institute coordinator, recruiting participants, arranging travel, scheduling curriculum planning meetings, arranging institute logistics, and scheduling post-institute mentorship and support. Though this section isn’t lengthy, note the level of detail here: one common concern raised by reviewers is that a work plan is “vague” or “murky.” When work plans are well-received, they are most often lauded for their “specificity.” Another concern that reviewers consistently raise has to do with labor. They want to be sure that all the work can get done, and that compensation is appropriate to the amount of time required for the program. It can be helpful to name the individuals who will be responsible for various tasks in the work plan (and make sure they also appear in the budget justification).  Ultimately, when it comes to the project narrative, reviewers are looking for evidence of a specific and clearly-defined vision. In the next post, we’ll talk about what’s involved in showing that you’ve done the planning necessary to make your vision a reality.

NYCDH Week – A Celebration of DH in the City,"NYCDH is happy to announce the 7th Annual NYCDH Week, February 7-11, 2022. Taking place at institutions home throughout New York City everywhere (again!), NYCDH Week gives individuals who are interested in digital humanities an opportunity to learn new techniques and skills, hear about DH projects, and become part of a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners. This year’s NYCDH Week theme is Support, as we build off of last year’s Care/Repair to show how a DH community can come together to support one another. While COVID still impacts us on a daily basis, and much of the focus of this DH Week will be on how to support one another in times of crisis, we also look to think beyond the pandemic and how we can reach out, and share our experiences, specialties, and sense of togetherness on a regular basis. This intention will come through in the roundtable we have planned for the kickoff event and through the annual announcement and presentation of the NYCDH Graduate Student Awards. In addition, we have added a series of support sessions that will provide our community with skills beyond the technical and academic realm, including project management, proposal and grant development, and early career development. Stay tuned for details about those. As we did last year NYCDH Week 2022 will take place in a fully online format, while continuing to do what it has done for the past six years — bring together individuals across the region who are interested in digital humanities, offering them opportunities to learn new techniques and skills, to hear about DH projects from across the city, and to connect with a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners.  The sculpture Support by Lorenzo Quinn In place of a traditional keynote lecture, this year’s kickoff event will feature a roundtable titled “Finding, Cultivating, and Sustaining Support for Your DH Project.” This roundtable will bring into conversation a variety of perspectives on the services, structures, and approaches necessary to conceive of and execute successful digital projects from experts in this field. The roundtable and subsequent discussion will help familiarize our NYCDH community with the wide range of structures of support that are available to NYCDH members and how to go about gaining access to that support. Read more here Roundtable participants will include As is tradition, following the introduction and kickoff roundtable we will be announcing the winners of our annual Graduate Student Awards with presentations by the winners, as NYCDH continues to support the next generation of scholars in the field.

UK-Ireland collaboration in digital humanities – UKRI,"Last updated: 12 April 2021                     Apply for funding for digital humanities research. Your project must be large, innovative and multidisciplinary. UK and Ireland-based researchers must collaborate on the project. The themes are: AHRC will provide up to £320,000 per project for UK costs, at 80% of the full economic cost. The Irish Research Council (IRC) will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%). Your project must start on 1 August 2021 and last for up to 36 months. Standard eligibility criteria (please see section two of AHRC’s research funding guide) will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK principal investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the principal investigator and any co-investigators to devote an average of at least four hours per week to the project. The UK component must fall within the remit of AHRC. Inter-disciplinary proposals are welcome but the majority of the methodologies, research questions and outputs must fall within AHRC’s subject remit. Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a project partner letter of support. Guidance on what needs to be included in a project partner letter of support is provided on page 71 of the AHRC research funding guide. Co-investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s international co-investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the case for support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration. Please refer to the AHRC research funding guide for further information on AHRC’s international co-investigator policy and which costs are eligible within a UK budget. The Irish principal investigator and co-investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the IRC’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the digital humanities field. Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date. In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the IRC before the award’s commencement. There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified. Please note that attendance at the programme’s UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Networking Workshop (October 2019), and/or engagement with its Research Networking Call, is not a pre-condition of application to this call. Specifically, the call aims to support a diverse range of projects that: The projects should take innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to explore the broad and inclusive themes: AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project. The IRC will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%).  Each award must start by 1 August 2021 and should have a duration of up to 36 months. The principal investigator in the UK will be responsible for submitting a joint UK-Ireland proposal through the research council’s Joint Electronic Submission system (Je-S). Applications should be submitted through the Je-S system by 18 March 2021 16:00, and will need to go through the appropriate institution submission process prior to this. To prepare a proposal form in Je-S: Je-S will then create a proposal form, displaying the relevant section headings. Using the blue question marks and the ‘Help’ link at the top of each section will provide guidance relevant to that section of the form. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one principal investigator to be included in a proposal. For this AHRC-IRC call, there is to be one principal investigator from the UK and one from Ireland. On the Je-S form the principal investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a co-investigator. Such terminology must be considered as a built-in system feature, and does not challenge the equal status and co-leadership of the UK and Irish PI. All investigators named on the Je-S application form, whether based in the UK or Ireland, must have a Je-S account. Where a named investigator does not already have a Je-S account, one can be easily set up, but please note that the process can take a number of days. It is therefore strongly recommended that the process is started well before the application deadline. Following the deadline for submission, all proposals will be checked for eligibility. After the deadline for submissions, PIs will be informed of any outstanding return for amendment requirements. Five working days will be given for the return for amendment process. More information about this process will be provided at the relevant stage of the call. Eligible proposals will be reviewed by AHRC and IRC nominated reviewers and there will a principal investigator response stage in April/May 2021. The PI response should be submitted by the UK principal investigator in consultation with the Irish principal investigator. A joint moderating panel will take place in early June where the eligible proposals will be graded and ranked. The panel will be comprised of members of the AHRC’s Peer Review College and academic reviewers nominated by the IRC. The panel will moderate the reviewers’ scores for each proposal, agree a ranked priority list of applications and make funding recommendations to the AHRC and the IRC. The panel will be asked to be consider the following criteria when making recommendations to the AHRC and IRC for funding.

Electronic Literature [Frame]works for the Creative Digital Humanities › electronic book review,"electronic book review digital futures of literature, theory, criticism, and the arts “Electronic Literature [Frame]works for the Creative Digital Humanities,” edited by Scott Rettberg and Alex Saum-Pascual, gathers a selection of articles exploring the evolving relationship between electronic literature and the digital humanities in Europe, North and South America. Looking at the combination of practices and methodologies that come about through e-lit’s production, study, and dissemination, these articles explore the disruptive potential of electronic literature to decenter and complement the DH field. Creativity is central and found at all levels and spheres of e-lit, but as the articles in this gathering show, there is a need to redeploy creative practice critically to address the increasing instrumentalization of the digital humanities and to turn the digital humanities towards the digital cultures of the present. Conceived as an ongoing conversation, rolling out 2-3 articles each month until the end of the year, all contributions are tackling at least one of the four following areas: Building Research Infrastructures and Environments, Exploring Creative Research Practice, Proposing Critical Reading Methodologies, and Applying Digital Pedagogy. “Introduction: Electronic Literature Frameworks for the Digital Humanities” by Scott Rettberg and Alex Saum – August 2020 “Appealing to your better judgment: A Call for Database Criticism” by Hannah Ackermans – August 2020 “Something there badly not wrong: The Life and Death of Literary Form in Databases” by Joseph Tabbi – August 2020 “Building STEAM for DH and Electronic Literature: An Educational Approach to Nurturing the STEAM Mindset in Higher Education” by Claudia von Vacano et al. – October 2020 “Documenting a Field: The Life and Afterlife of the ELMCIP Collaborative Research Project and Electronic Literature Knowledge Base” by Scott Rettberg – January 2021 “Digital Creativity as Critical Material Thinking: The Disruptive Potential of Electronic Literature” by Alex Saum – August 2020 “Addressing Significant Societal Challenges Through Critical Digital Media” by Scott Rettberg and Roderick Coover – August 2020 “What Should the System Say?

“Blog Post: What Do Girls Dig? | Bethany Nowviskie” in “Debates in the Digital Humanities” on Debates in the DH Manifold,"PART III ][ Blog Posts What Do Girls Dig? BETHANY NOWVISKIE “Has data-mining in the humanities emerged as a gentleman’s sport? Two and a half conversations about gender, language, and the ‘Digging into Data Challenge.’” A two-day conference has been announced, associated with an international funding program, rightly (I think) hailed as transformative for the humanities. I was excited. I ed the link. I scrolled down. I did a double take, which means I scrolled up and then down again. Next, I scrolled very slowly, counting. I almost didn’t tweet this, but then I did: Instant feedback: There were some other comments, and retweets, too. I was starting to feel a little sheepish about sparking a negative and public discussion of an issue uncomfortable for many, and about which I often feel ambivalent—but I knew that the group would shortly hear from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), one of several funders of the program. These guys are always plugged in and ever responsive. If you “welcome suggestions” on Twitter, you will get them. More with the instant feedback: Those were the serious suggestions, taken seriously. (Another NEH staffer picked up the thread on my Facebook page and gave a very sensitive and cogent response, including an appeal for names of particular researchers and communities of practice to reach out to.) Meanwhile, things on Twitter seemed to get silly. But maybe these questions about the rhetoric of data mining actually get at another side of a serious issue. At the very least, they gesture at a subtler, but equally worthwhile brand of digital humanities outreach: attention to our language. So …what do girls dig? On Facebook—where a colleague pointed out what he called a similar “boys on the podium” gender imbalance in a “future of academic libraries” symposium (“the future is manly!”)—the discussion generated a steady, ridiculous, and slightly dangerous stream of jokes. A manly future for libraries in beer and electric guitars. Flowered gloves and gardening trowels as more appropriate for ladylike digging into data. A duty to lie back and think of England as our data furrows are ploughed. That last one was mine. And since I started this whole mess, and in a rather flippant way, you may think I’m just full of snark. In fact, I believe NEH and other “Digging into Data” supporters do a consistently brilliant job of identifying sensitive and qualified peer reviewers and funding worthy projects. NEH’s digital humanities programs, in particular, always strike me as broadly representative of the actual makeup of the field. I’m sure that gender imbalance in this area has little to do with the Digging into Data grant-making process and more with broader issues, going all the way back (yes, that chestnut) to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education for girls in the public schools. But mostly, I suspect, all this is about the number of female academics both qualified and inclined to do data-mining work, and who find themselves both at a stage of their careers and possessed of adequate collaborative networks to support their applications for such grants. Although it wasn’t exactly what I was going for, I respect my pals’ advocacy, highlighted earlier, for funders’ launching of an aggressive campaign to identify and mentor more women applicants for programs like “Digging into Data.” And clearly there’s institutional work to be done on the level of our schools, colleges, and universities. Personally, however, I feel less strongly about both of those things than I do about the need for the entire digital humanities (DH) community to be as thoughtful as possible about the way we describe this kind of work—about the language we use. I’ve heard three kinds of responses from female colleagues and students about the “Digging into Data” Challenge. One (the rarest) is simple enthusiasm; though it’s interesting that presumably few women applied and none of their projects were compelling enough to fund. Another is trepidation: Is this too hardcore? Involving too much math or statistical analysis I never learned? Do I understand the scholarly possibilities and have the support network I’d need? In other words: this is a challenge. Am I competitive? (in every sense of that word). The third kind of response (which includes my own) has more to do with framing and rhetoric. I suspect I haven’t gotten super-interested in this kind of work because I’ve heard few descriptions of it that really speak to my own interpretive/hermeneutic/experiential/design-oriented approach to DH. (Though the one that looks at quilts as a source for visual and stylistic analysis is very cool.) And I have a hunch that it’s not just me—that the disconnect from certain brands of digital methods felt by many researchers of my ilk (note that ilk is not gender) has more to do with the language being used for methodological and research-findings descriptions, and the intellectual orientation of the people doing the describing, than with the nature of, say, data mining itself. It’s easy to make a joke about imperialist and gendered undertones in the “digging in” rhetoric, but to some degree the advertising campaign for this program set the tone, for a broad and new community, of DH’s engagement with data mining. So that’s what I was after, when I raised the issue with an offhand comment or two online. Improved outreach to particular underrepresented groups is never a bad idea, but I’d prefer to see NEH and its funding partners (and individual DH centers and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations and our publications, etc.) start by becoming more thoughtful about the language we all use to describe and to signal data mining to a very broad community of researchers. After all, digital humanities nerds, we are still the minority in most of our departments, are we not? A little attention to audience and rhetoric can go a long way toward making applications and results of digital methods seem comprehensible, inspiring, and potentially transformative. Even to scholars who didn’t think digging and delving was their (dainty, fine-china) cup of tea. And there’s always this option—an idea, I assume, free for the taking: NOTE This chapter was originally published on April 7, 2011, at http://nowviskie.org/2011/what-do-girls-dig/ and http://storify.com/nowviskie/, first as an experiment in using the online Storify system, then in beta release.

Opinion | Just How White Is the Book Industry? - The New York Times,"By Richard Jean So and Gus WezerekDec. 11, 2020 During last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, books written by people of color climbed the best-seller lists. Was last summer a vision of equality to come for the publishing industry? Or a flash in the pan? 
Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah had just turned 26 when he got the call in 2017 that Mariner Books wanted to publish his short-story collection, “Friday Black.”
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah suspected that the contract he signed — a $10,000 advance for “Friday Black” and $40,000 for an unfinished second book — wasn’t ideal. But his father had cancer and the money provided a modicum of security.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah’s uneasiness over his book deal became more acute last summer. Using the hashtag #PublishingPaidMe, writers had begun to share their advances on Twitter with the goal of exposing racial pay disparities in publishing. Some white authors disclosed that they had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their debut books.
 

 

 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah wanted to share his contract. But he knew that doing so could make his publisher look bad and hurt his career. “It’s scary when it’s your life,” he said.
 
	Reticence gave way to action, though, when he thought about Jesmyn Ward’s tweet about how she “fought and fought” for a $100,000 advance, even after one of her novels won a National Book Award.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah started to type.
 
As #PublishingPaidMe spread online, more than a thousand people in the publishing industry signed up for a day of action to support the Black community.
 
	Publishing executives responded by releasing statements expressing support for racial justice, announcing antiracism training and promising to put out more books by writers of color. If they follow through, last summer’s activism could diversify the range of voices that American readers encounter for years to come.
 
	But measuring progress isn’t easy, and requires a baseline to compare against: How many current authors are people of color? As far as we could tell, that data didn’t exist.
 
	So we set out to collect it. First, we gathered a list of English-language fiction books published between 1950 and 2018. That list came from WorldCat, a global catalog of library collections. We wanted to focus on books that were widely read, so we limited our analysis to titles that were held by at least 10 libraries and for which we could find digital editions.
 
	We also constrained our search to books released by some of the most prolific publishing houses during the period of our analysis: Simon & Schuster, Penguin Random House, Doubleday (a major publisher before it merged with Random House in 1998), HarperCollins and Macmillan. After all that we were left with a dataset containing 8,004 books, written by 4,010 authors.
 
	To identify those authors’ races and ethnicities, we worked alongside three research assistants, reading through biographies, interviews and social media posts. Each author was reviewed independently by two researchers. If the team couldn’t come to an agreement about an author’s race, or there simply wasn’t enough information to feel confident, we omitted those authors’ books from our analysis. By the end, we had identified the race or ethnicity of 3,471 authors.
 
	We guessed that most of the authors would be white, but we were shocked by the extent of the inequality once we analyzed the data. Of the 7,124 books for which we identified the author’s race, 95 percent were written by white people.
 
	Author diversity at major publishing houses has increased in recent years, but white writers still dominate. Non-Hispanic white people account for 60 percent of the U.S. population; in 2018, they wrote 89 percent of the books in our sample.
 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 
	This broad imbalance is likely linked to the people who work in publishing. The heads of the “big five” publishing houses (soon, perhaps, to become the “big four”) are white. So are 85 percent of the people who acquire and edit books, according to a 2019 survey.
 
	“There’s a correlation between the number of people of color who work in publishing and the number of books that are published by authors of color,” said Tracy Sherrod, the editorial director of Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins that is focused on Black literature.
 
	That correlation is visible in our data, exemplified by Toni Morrison’s career as an editor at Random House from 1967 to 1983. Random House’s first female Black editor, Ms. Morrison championed writers such as Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas and Gayl Jones. During her tenure, 3.3 percent of the 806 books published by Random House in our data were written by Black authors.
 
	The number of Black authors dropped sharply at Random House after Ms. Morrison left. Of the 512 books published by Random House between 1984 and 1990 in our data, just two were written by Black authors: Ms. Morrison’s “Beloved”  (through Knopf, which was owned by Random House) and “Sarah Phillips,” by Andrea Lee.
 
	(Random House published 12 books during this period by non-Black writers of color such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Michael Ondaatje, according to our data. In a response to our analysis, Random House pointed out that it was the longtime publisher of Maya Angelou, whose autobiography “All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes” was released in 1986; because it is a work of nonfiction, it is not included in our statistics.)
 
	In 1967, the same year that Ms. Morrison joined Random House, Marie Dutton Brown started as an intern at Doubleday and eventually rose to the rank of senior editor. Now a literary agent, Ms. Brown said that she witnessed how ephemeral gains for Black writers can be.
 
	“Black life and Black culture are rediscovered every 10 to 15 years,” said Ms. Brown. “Publishing reflects that.”
 
	Ms. Brown attributed the fluctuation in publishers’ support for Black writers to the news cycle, which periodically directs the nation’s attention to acts of brutality against Black people. Publishers’ interest in amplifying Black voices wanes as media coverage peters out because “many white editors are not exposed to Black life beyond the headlines,” Ms. Brown said.
 
	The lack of diversity among authors might be obscured by a small number of high-profile nonfiction books written by athletes, celebrities and politicians of color, according to Ms. Brown. “It gives the appearance that there are a lot of Black books published,” while publishers’ less famous “mid-list” authors are overwhelmingly white, she said.
 
	Literary prizes may also make publishing appear more diverse than it actually is. Over the past decade, more than half of the 10 most recent books that were awarded the National Book Award for fiction were written by people of color; Colson Whitehead has won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction twice in the past four years.
 
	Look at the books that appeared on The New York Times’s best-seller list for fiction, though, and a different picture emerges: Only 22 of the 220 books on the list this year were written by people of color.
 
	L.L. McKinney, an author of young-adult novels who started the #PublishingPaidMe hashtag, wasn’t surprised by the statistics on how few Black authors have been published relative to white authors.
 
	“I’ve heard things like, ‘We already have our Black girl book for the year,’” said Ms. McKinney. She also remembered comments suggesting books wouldn’t sell well if they had a Black person on the cover.
 
	In a 1950 essay titled “What White Publishers Won’t Print,” Zora Neale Hurston identified the chicken-or-egg dilemma at the heart of publishers’ conservatism. White people, she wrote, cannot conceive of Black people outside of racial stereotypes. And because publishers want to sell books, they publish stories that conform to those stereotypes, reinforcing white readers’ expectations and appetites.
 
	“It’s amusing to me when publishers say that they follow the market,” said Ms. McKinney. “They’re doing it because of tradition. And the tradition is racism.”
 
	Michael Strother, a former editor at Simon & Schuster, remembers the meeting in 2016 when he realized how limited his white colleagues’ imaginations were when it came to Black authors. Mr. Strother was trying to persuade executives to authorize a large bid for “The Hate U Give,” Angie Thomas’s young-adult novel about the fallout from a police shooting.
 
	Co-workers in the meeting praised the book; others teared up as they discussed its importance. “It was not only a good book, but a marketable book and an important book,” Mr. Strother said. “It should have been an easy yes.”
 
	Some of Mr. Strother’s white colleagues were hesitant, though. One asked, “Do we need Angie Thomas if we have Jason Reynolds?” (Mr. Reynolds is another Black author of young-adult novels.)
 
	“Their books are not similar at all except they both have Black characters,” said Mr. Strother, who is now a law student at New York University.
 
	Mr. Strother, whose account of the meeting was corroborated by one other person who was present, said he was authorized to bid far less than what he knew he would need to win the auction. Since it was published by Balzer + Bray, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 2017, “The Hate U Give” has spent 196 weeks on the Times young-adult best-seller list.
 
	Asked to comment on the acquisitions meeting, Simon & Schuster provided the following statement: “At Simon & Schuster Children’s Publishing, we are proud of our long and continuing history of publishing Black voices. While we typically do not comment on the acquisition process, each potential acquisition is considered based on its own merits. In 2016 we made a six-figure bid for Angie Thomas’s debut novel ‘The Hate U Give’ (plus a follow-up novel) in a heated auction between multiple publishers and the book eventually went to another publisher.”
 
A few days after Mr. Adjei-Brenyah tweeted his book deal, he received a message from his agent: Mariner Books wanted to restructure his contract and pay him “a lot more” for his second book.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah viewed his publisher’s reaction to his tweet as a small step toward dismantling decades of racism in publishing. “I’ve been growing into my courage,” he said. “Now I have to carry that energy forward.”
 
	A number of signs indicate that publishers are also carrying forward the energy from the summer’s protests.
 
	In October, Hachette Book Group announced the creation of Legacy Lit, one of several imprints started this year that are devoted to publishing books by writers of color. Krishan Trotman, who will lead the imprint, said she’s seen waves of support for Black authors come and go, but that Legacy Lit represents a real commitment to diversity by Hachette.
 
	“There will be a huge boom of books — all of a sudden Black women are hot or urban fiction is hot — and then there will be a backslide,” said Ms. Trotman. “That’s why we need these imprints. They’ll be here even after all the hoopla dies down.”
 
	Along with Dana Canedy at Simon & Schuster and Lisa Lucas at Pantheon and Schocken Books, Ms. Trotman is one of several Black women who were named to senior publishing jobs this year. Like Ms. Morrison 50 years ago, they may be able to clear the way for more writers of color to flourish.
 
	The bottom rungs of publishing are also a source of hope. When Ms. Brown started at Doubleday in 1967, she was the only Black intern in her year’s cohort. In 2019, almost half of all publishing interns identified as people of color.
 
	Whether those interns can grow into careers like Ms. Trotman’s or Ms. Brown’s will depend on publishers’ continued willingness to hire, promote and listen to people who they have historically sidelined. Our data suggests that progress toward diversity can be as short-lived as a single editor’s tenure.
 
	“The presence of Black editors is really important,” said Ms. Brown. “But you need more than one at the table.”
 Note: If a book had multiple authors and at least one of them was a person of color, we categorized the book as being by a person of color. Our analysis is limited by its focus on the best-known major publishers, omitting decades of important work by publishers such as Quinto Sol Publications and Broadside Press.

International Webinar Series on Interdisciplinary Perspectives of Digital Humanities | KIIT University News & Events,"KIIT University News & Events - KIIT Deemed to be University News

 International Webinar series on Interdisciplinary Perspectives of Digital Humanities was held on 20th February 2021. The Inaugural Ceremony was graced by Prof. Kalyani Samantaray, Professor & Head, Faculty of Arts, Communication & Indic Studies, Sri Sri University; Prof. Hrushikesha Mohanty, VC, KIIT; Prof. Sudarshan Nanda, Head CIR; and Prof. A. K. Sen, Chairman, UG Progamme and Dean-in-Charge, School of Humanities.   Speaking at the inaugural session, Prof. Kalyani Samantaray talked about the future of Digital Humanities in an explicit way. Prof. Hrushikesha Mohanty expressed happiness that the School of Humanities has been conducting a number of webinars and wished the trend to continue in the near future. Prof. Sudarshan Nanda emphasized on the need of organizing more webinars on the subject for the benefit of the research scholars. Prof. A. K. Sen talked about the technical aspects of the Digital Humanities. Dr. Deepanjali Mishra, Convenor and Dr. Sukanta Chandra Swain, Associate Dean, School of Humanities also spoke on the occasion. At the first technical session, Dr. Nandini C. Sen, Associate Professor, Delhi University spoke on the topic, ‘Post colonialism, Gender and Digital Humanities’. She explained the meaning, scope, tool and techniques of Digital Humanities, while pointing out the existing digital divide and gender divide in today’s era. She also raised her concern about fake information and cyber crimes and suggested all the participants read ‘Things Fall Apart’. Ms. Sugyanta Priyadarshini, Faculty, School of Humanities moderated the session. At the second technical session, Dr. Liang Lao, Associate Professor Department of Modern & Classical Languages and Literature and Cultures, University of Kentucky, USA began her talk with the legendary Chinese story, ‘The white Snake’. She made a comparison to the snake that takes the form of a lady and tries to live as a human (but fails). She then spoke about ‘Alice in the Pandemic’ where the female protagonist playing the role of a nurse poignantly portrays about her mental and physical constraints. Dr. Lao concluded her talk with a short 8 minute video of Indrani Pal titled ‘Lady White Snake’, which is an amalgamation of eastern concept of snake spirit with western version of vampire.

Introducing Emily | Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP),"Hi Emily! Can you please tell us a bit about your career trajectory so far? It’s been something of a wandering trajectory! I completed my BA in History and English at Monash University in 2002, returning to Monash for Honours in History in 2005, and on to Melbourne for my PhD in 2007, looking at Australia and the United States during the development of Australian federation, which I finished in 2018. At the same time I worked in different call centres, including at Yarra City Council, and eventually was able to move into the role of Community Grants Administrator there in 2012. I also was able to take up some different research and teaching related roles in this time, including a summer internship at the Library of Congress in Washington, and as an intern with The University of Melbourne’s Digital Studio where I worked with fellow MDAPer, Aleks (Dr. Aleks Michalewicz). While studying I became increasingly interested in the digital humanities and the possibilities available for researchers there, and after finishing my thesis started learning different programming languages, which ultimately led to me starting my dream job with MDAP in February 2020. Tell us about an interesting project at MDAP? I’m just diving into a new collaboration that I am very excited about. The MDAP team is working with Prof. Julie Willis and Soon-Tzu Speechley in the Australian Centre for Architectural History, Urban and Cultural Heritage. They have been doing interesting work looking at architectural history in a new way, and we will be collaborating to visualise the data they have, to show how architects moved and worked within and across the British Empire in the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. What are some of the solvable, difficult, and wicked problems on your horizon? I think the ever present problem is keeping on top of the different tools and techniques for data analysis, and knowing or working out which is the best option for any given situation. On the plus side, this means I’m constantly learning new things, which is the way I like to be. Can you tell us about your latest adventure or next planned one outside of MDAP? My last big adventure was travelling around the United States for a month after I finished my thesis. I was able to visit friends in Dallas, Boston, Baltimore, Washington and Atlanta; be a tourist in Los Angeles; meet an old family friend in Chicago to go and see Hamilton, and spend a week in a mansion on the outer banks of North Carolina blues dancing. It was magical! In the context of a rapidly evolving global environment and UoM’s research strategy, what would you most like to explore, challenge, or innovate in your work in the future? I’m also looking forward to working more in less familiar domains, and with different members of the MDAP team, expanding my skills and experience and contributing my humanities background to all sorts of projects.   — Lead image: Emily seeing Hamilton in Chicago in 2018.

(Student Voices) The Topography of Data: Visualizing NEH Grants | Humanities for All,"(Student Voices) The Topography of Data: Visualizing NEH Grants Screenshot of the interactive map the students created in ArcGIS. This is the first of two blog posts written by graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). In Fall 2020, the National Humanities Alliance partnered with a digital humanities course on three semester-long projects that the students worked on in groups. In this post, Ben Williams describes his experience working as part of the group tasked with creating a map of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grants with a congressional district overlay for the NHA’s NEH for All initiative. This map combines several data sets into one visually accessible map and is an invaluable resource in highlighting the widespread impact of the NEH.  -- While enrolled in English 76-829, an introductory course to digital humanities at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 2020, our class collaborated with the National Humanities Alliance (NHA) on three digital humanities projects. My group’s task seemed simple: build a comprehensive map with a congressional district overlay that could communicate the impact of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant funding throughout the United States. In other words, we were asked to make the geographically widespread impact of the NEH more visually accessible for advocates. Our project was seemingly objective and its visual representation obvious, but over time we found ourselves having to continually reassess how we mapped data.  When we map, code, or quantify as humanists, questions arise about how power asymmetries might determine who or what counts. We thought deeply about not just the spatial spread of our data, but what I consider its topography. That is, the data’s layers built on humanistic contexts: robust stories, archived documents, and searchable details. Grants for exhibitions like “Picturing the Past” or “Adios Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950” were condensed to titles, geocodes, and program types. We knew little about their layered histories including their inception, implementation, and reception. Even within this relatively small data set, I was reminded of the need for what Tricia Wang calls “thick data,” 1
 which, with gesture toward Clifford Geertz’s notion of “thick description,” 2
 seeks to reveal “the social context of and connections between data points,” not just the “insights within a particular range of data points.” But to transform our data into thick data, we needed broad frames and minute details that might reveal the character of each of the data-funded grants, projects, and institutions captured in those Excel sheets and mitigate the issues of representation that come from staid data points.  We first had to sift through a surfeit of information about funding. And if there’s one thing I learned from looking at the collection of Excel sheets sent to us, it is that data overwhelms, and immense data overwhelms immensely. I found myself feeling adrift and incapable of contextualizing the information provided: unfamiliar names, unpredictably titled institutions, grants referred to by proxies or discrepant identifiers. Making sense of it required some investment in researching each of the programs in our data set. For example, we looked extensively at websites related to the “Muslim Journeys Bookshelf,” a collaboration between the American Library Association (ALA) and the NEH that provides public audiences in the U.S. with accessible and trustworthy materials related to Islam and Islamic civilizations. Rather than just seeing the geographic reach of the funding associated with this project, I started to understand the material and cultural impact of providing archival documents, books, films, and other programming resources to create space for audiences to become more familiar with people, places, history, faith, and cultures of Muslims around the world and in the US. Across testimonials, there was spirited reflection on the significance and positive reception of the content and materials from institutions and communities who now housed the bookshelf. Working through these details underscored the ways that feelings, thoughts, and reactions are often veiled by numeric data. Through this additional research, the data started to become more humanistic and helped us see what and who we were trying to map. Eventually, with ArcGIS, a mapping software, the data’s topography was rendered over a spattering of colorful dots on the US with outlines of congressional districts. However, we found that as the data points were placed on the map, there were areas with dramatic absences, making the map appear partisan. While data points were sparse in red states and rural spaces, blue states and urban areas were filled with them. We determined that including data from Chronicling America, an NEH-sponsored repository of historic US newspaper information, would help visualize the reach of the NEH more evenly at different scales on the map. But the data was sent as a text file, which came with its own set of issues. Columns were indistinct and locations were hidden in parentheticals that made mapping difficult. Chris Warren, our digital humanities instructor, sifted through the data and used Pandas to compile it into a readable and, most importantly, usable form. Once put into ArcGIS, we saw the fruits of our labor scattered throughout the map, filling in the blank spots and underscoring the NEH-funded projects’ truer geographic distribution. We were given the code used to turn the text file of Chronicling America into something we could put on our map, and in this moment, I was reminded of how digital humanities works. It’s about templates of knowledge. Python, Regular Expressions, and Pandas are all useful tools and modes of knowledge that are easily transferable, and by availing ourselves  to the code, we can put it to work when we encounter similar issues with messy data sets. So perhaps to revise an earlier comment, data does overwhelm, but less immensely when you have a template to help clean it.   Benjamin Williams is a Ph.D. student in Literary and Cultural Studies at Carnegie Mellon University. His research centers on how border rhetorics in literature, photography, and law construct conceptions of race, nation, and gender in the United States. He has presented his work examining migrant literature and visual culture at several conferences, including those hosted by Philosophy of the City, Comparative Drama, Northeast Modern Language Association (NeMLA), and Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS).

Alumna lends expertise to Georgetown slavery archive project - Georgetown Today,"In conjunction with Michigan State University and the University of Virginia, Georgetown is continuing its commitment to slavery reconciliation by expanding access to these institutions’ slavery-related archive material through the “On These Grounds” project. This collaborative initiative will implement a novel approach to connecting thousands of archival items across the universities, including letters and bills of sale. In addition, the linked-data approach will use context and events as guides to paint a more comprehensive view of the lived histories and backgrounds of the enslaved communities at these institutions. “On These Grounds” is financially supported by gifts from alumni and a $550,000 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which has funded other archival and digital humanities efforts across the three universities. While colleges and universities have distinct approaches to examining and interpreting their individual histories as slavery-complicit institutions, Dean of Georgetown University Library Harriette Hemmasi says that the project’s methodology will enable a broader understanding of the similarities and differences in these shared histories. With its focus on events recorded in the archives, the project will enhance the ability of scholars and the public to access and analyze these historical records and will allow descendants of those enslaved to gain a more dynamic picture of their ancestors’ lives. “The most important part of this project is that we are opening and connecting the archives in ways never before possible,” Hemmasi says. “In the past, we looked at each archive as if it were a separate, unique entity. With this model, however, researchers and the public will have the ability to examine and compare a wide range of archives to reconstruct a more comprehensive history, while also being able to delve more deeply into individual records. As the archives are allowed to speak, they will tell us the stories that shaped not only the lives of our institutions but, more importantly, the lives of those enslaved at our institutions,” Hemmasi adds. Sharon Leon (C’97), associate professor of history and digital humanities at Michigan State, birthed the idea for “On These Grounds” and now serves as the project director. As an American Studies major, Leon learned to examine critical questions about American culture and heritage. Her role in this project connects to her first encounters with Georgetown’s slavery archives during her sophomore year, when she “worked with primary sources from archival materials related to the Maryland Province Jesuits” as part of a digital humanities project she and her fellow American Studies students conducted. “In existing scholarship, the scope is really about the Jesuits and why they did what they did. Now it’s our job to expand that lens and find out as much as we can about the enslaved community, about their families, and about the conditions in which they lived,” says Leon. Thus far, Leon has researched about 1,200 individuals living between 1717 and 1838, including Henny, who was a midwife and George and Flora, who lost three of their six children in one year due to a smallpox outbreak in the early 1790s. Beyond her expertise in digital humanities, Leon says she feels obligated to take on this project because of her family’s legacy as Georgetown alumni. “My father not only attended and worked at Georgetown, but my father’s family was from colonial Southern Maryland,” Leon says. “So I’m certain that my father’s family was on the ground with the very enslaved people I’m learning about.” Hemmasi and Leon emphasize that the work to learn more about the enslaved communities at Georgetown falls on the shoulders of the entire university community. “Grappling with the history of slavery at colleges and universities is a contemporary issue. These institutions multiplied access to privileged white people and limited equitable access to the descendants of the enslaved in a way that has had lasting consequences,” Leon says. “Therefore, this is everybody’s problem, but especially my problem as an alumna. My family didn’t pay tuition, but this work is my tuition. This is my ongoing debt.” At 6 feet, 10 inches tall, Coach John Thompson Jr.—affectionately known as “Big John”—stood above many as an athlete, pioneering NCAA coach, architect of the Big East, three-time Olympian, and… Above: Aline de Souza, M.D., (left) and Xie Wu (right) do RNA prep for ACE2 studies led by Hong Ji, M.D. When the pandemic began widening in March 2020, Georgetown… The Crown Heights community is made up of mostly low-income families of color.

Digital Humanities Day |,"Thank you for attending DH Day 2021! You can watch the event recordings here. What does it mean to study the humanities? What can you do with an arts/humanities degree? Every year, there are articles lamenting the decline of the humanities and the dire prospects that arts and humanities majors face. The impacts of COVID-19 on educational institutions and the workplace have reignited the same old question: Who needs the humanities?  Digital Humanities Day 2021 will explore the value of the humanities in the current moment. Through panel discussions with UW students and alumni from the arts, humanities, and social sciences, we hope students will leave inspired to explore different possibilities for their future, and get an idea of what working in the humanities looks like in a variety of fields.",https://www.centerfornonprofitexcellence.org/jobs/digital-humanities-intern
Inventing the Digital Humanities through Freirian Praxis:  Folding-Unfolding-Refolding,"“[W]hat is broken and twisted is also beautiful, and a bearer of knowledge. The Deformed Humanities is an origami crane—a piece of paper contorted into an object of startling insight and beauty.” Mark Sample The Digital Humanities are actively being invented in this very moment. They have not taken shape as a concrete thing, but evolve as an ongoing and collaborative process still taking shape. This can be seen in how the Digital Humanities are being negotiated as a debate between building and breaking. What’s being built: word clouds, wikis, blogs, maps, games, comics, prezis, films, crowdsourced articles, MOOCs, curated social media stories, and greater access.  What’s being broken: traditional pedagogy, poems, images, borders, and potentially even the law. While this has been the dominant narrative, I want to propose a counter narrative where transformation and invention occur not through the building or breaking binary, but rather as a result of folding, unfolding, and refolding. This origami metaphor, I think, aligns with Freirian Praxis as a process of “engaging in a cycle of theory, application, evaluation, reflection, and then back to theory.” The need to develop this counter narrative was apparent after co-teaching an upper level English course. The course had two distinct instructor personas — a luddite and a cyborg — and we were on the path to creating another iteration of the dissonant building and breaking narrative. My assignments allowed students to build digital and multimodal artifacts. The other instructor urged students to break down texts from critically informed perspectives. However, by folding these two personal pedagogical approaches together, we were able to collaboratively realize Freirean praxis as a cycle of theory-practice-theory. Such an understanding of praxis encourages us to question assumed knowledge, challenge habits of mind, and oppose unreasonable prejudices. This folding counter narrative not only invigorates the collaborative power of praxis, but it can also help to advance the ongoing invention of the Digital Humanities in more meaningful ways. My first semester co-teaching was representative of the building and breaking narrative. My assignments asked students to build their own digital artifact using images, paintings, audio, and printed texts. It was a creative form of curation where students formed their own arguments through multiple modes of electronic production. My colleague relied more strictly on textual criticism, analysis, and interpretation through an elaborate process of close-reading. So while I had students digitally build things, my colleague had them break down texts. As someone who happily wore the title of a luddite, my colleague openly expressed his list of grievances with texting, Facebook, Twitter, as well as what he considered ten thousand other digital distractions. I struggled to convince him that these things might help to further the humanities in the 21st century while he struggled to convince me that the old methods couldn’t be strengthened by digital intervention. The result was a class divided. After our first semester co-teaching, my colleague and I reflected on the negative implications of reinforcing the building and breaking narrative. While both of our teaching traditions were beneficial in their own right, the stylistic divide between my colleague and I resulted in a weakened classroom foundation. Many students felt that literary criticism mars the original artwork, but my colleague found that criticism as a practice actually helps to build something new. In a similar phenomenon, despite the fact that students were building digital and multimodal artifacts, I found that they were simultaneously performing an act of criticism. As a whole, during our post-class reflection we discussed how we might combine our perspectives through more transformative practices. How could we coalesce our two methods to create an even stronger classroom pedagogy? From this discussion, we set out to fuse these aspects of building and breaking into one assignment. A year after my initial co-teaching experience, the digital and analog humanities began to fold together through an assignment that employed the metaphor of origami. Students integrated the primary text of a novel and film alongside various interviews, reviews, and criticisms centered around these primary texts; they used numerous critical angles provided by literary and film critics in order to create a situated multimodal and digital practice. The goal was to demonstrate that literary critics could use word clouds, popular memes, YouTube videos, podcasts, blogs, timelines, comics, and websites to visualize their data and research. At the same time, I wanted to demonstrate how digital practices might integrate close-reading strategies as well as more traditional modes of literary criticism, analysis, and the array of other rhetorical affordances akin to print literacy. In short, the assignment was successful because it fused together our once divergent views of the humanities. The spirit behind this collaboration corresponds with the tenets of “serious play,” which Robin Wharton models after how “Children learn — to communicate, to use tools, to count — by playing. Curricula in many early childhood educational settings are designed around this basic principle.” As a concept, “play” not only aided in the creation of the previous assignment, but when taken as a mindstate it can also help to unite the digital and analog humanities on one integral path. The collaborative process inherent to many forms of play allowed our digital and analog classroom practices to work together not as thesis and antithesis, but as two equally valuable processes that benefited from being folded together. One does not necessarily need to build digital artifacts to take part in the invention of the Digital Humanities. It’s also not necessary to break apart the entirety of traditional pedagogy. Freirian praxis tells us that there is action in critical reflection. In other words, invention can mean following our classroom practice with critical reflection, which can help to further inform subsequent actions. This awareness is at the heart of the folding-unfolding-refolding counter narrative. I am advocating for an approach that intertwines personal experience alongside collective or collaborative invention, particularly as it relates to the Digital Humanities. Freirian praxis defines the personal as systemic, and by generalizing from the personal we are enacting the folding-unfolding-refolding dialectic. Stated a different way, by questioning the motivation behind personal classroom practices, whether we profess to be cyborgs or luddites, those aspects of our teaching that normally go unquestioned can work to inform the ongoing invention and evolution of the humanities. Adeline Koh concurs with this sentiment when she says, “You are already a digital humanist, whether or not you know it.” Our contemporary human experience is mediated by digital technologies, and therefore to study the humanities is necessarily to study the Digital Humanities. I would like to end by evoking the concept of the “unfolded fold,” which Henri Michaux writes about in his poetic musing, “In the Land of Magic” (1941). Michaux speaks of educated people, or “mages,” who see between the folds not as a result of some unobtainable or esoteric knowledge, but from practically interacting with the world in unfamiliar ways. In this context, inventing the Digital Humanities might benefit not merely from implementing new tools and techniques (i.e. esoteric knowledge), but more simply from seeing our pedagogy in new and unfamiliar ways. Similar to how a piece of paper can be “contorted into an object of startling insight and beauty,” so too does this practice take the well known elements of the Digital Humanities and fold them into something new.

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. Through machine learning, researchers do not hardcode programs to perform tasks, rather they allow a computer to generate its own rules to perform these tasks. This is achieved via various methods of training. While machine learning has its conceptual incipience in the 1960s, it did not receive much public attention until the early 2010s. Over the past five years, the methods and applications of machine learning has grown substantially, while the resources for implementing machine learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and FastAI, have made it much more accessible. Despite this accessibility a large gap remains. This gap exists in two forms: conceptual understanding of machine learning and knowledge of programming. This presentation focuses on the former by providing digital humanists a basic introduction to machine learning while presuming no knowledge of mathematics or programming. The presentation will address popular misconceptions about artificial intelligence, explain the fundamental concepts and terminology of machine learning, and conclude with an explanation of the resources available to humanists for getting started. The goal of this presentation is, therefore, to provide viewers with a starting point for exploring machine learning and its potential application to their projects. William Mattingly is a Postdoctoral Fellow for the Analysis of Historical Texts at the Smithsonian Institution Data Science Lab in collaboration with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). His research has focused on developing text classification neural network models to identify sources in medieval texts. He is also developing named entity recognition (NER) models for ancient and medieval languages, such as Latin (Classical and Medieval), Ancient Greek, Old English, Old Norse, and Old High German. At the Smithsonian and USHMM, he is developing machine learning methods to aid, in among other things, a pipeline for automatically processing and cataloging hundreds of millions of Holocaust documents. He is co-investigator and lead developer for The Bitter Aloe Project project (https://www.rch.uky.edu/project_bitteraloe.html) and lead investigator and developer for the Digital Alcuin Project. He has a B.A. and M.A. in History from Florida Gulf Coast University and a Ph.D. in History from the University of Kentucky. His dissertation research explored using historical social network analysis, cluster analysis, and computational methods for identifying ninth-century intellectual and pedagogical networks. --10:00-10:50am-- ""Introduction to Python and its Research Applications in the Humanities""
What is Python, and why should humanists want to use it? Which digital humanities methods can Python be used for? And what are the first steps for a new Python-user to get started? This presentation, geared towards beginners, will address what Python is and how it can be used for specific research applications in the digital humanities (statistics, text mining, network analysis). The presentation will guide prospective users in the installation, first steps, and basic applications of these research tools, expecting no prior experience in programming or statistics. Specifically, after motivating the use of Python through its many applications, we will examine the installation process through the Anaconda distribution. We will then elucidate the differences between Python’s editor and markdown environments (Jupyter Notebook and Spyder), and then delineate the conceptual logic underlying Python through an introduction to object types (and the methods attached to them) and Python libraries (numpy, Pandas). We will combine what we’ve learned in a research application example to conclude the presentation. My hope is that participants walk away with the feeling that they know where to start if they want to pursue Python further, and that they will want to do so! Daniella Gáti (any pronouns) is a digital humanist, and scholar of contemporary literature, media, and digital culture. Their current work examines the relationship between social media forms of anti-racist and queer protest and contemporary dissent fiction. He is also developing a coauthored project with an economist that investigates how sentiment analysis of novels can be used to extract valuable information about society’s beliefs about its long-term economic prospects. Daniella received her Ph.D. in English from Brandeis University, an MA in English from the University of Bern, Switzerland, and an MA and BA in Economics, also from Bern. Her dissertation examines the vignette as a counterhegemonic representational form in and around the book in contemporary print and digital fiction, as well as in a book historical dimension. --11:00-11:50am-- “Advanced Features of Scalar”
Scalar an open source publishing platform available to the UIC community through Digital UIC (digital.uic.edu). It is designed to make it easy for authors to write and publish long-form digital scholarship. Scalar also allows users to assemble media from multiple sources such as YouTube and the Digital Public Library of America and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required. This presentation will cover the basics of creating a Scalar site and then move on to demonstrating the more advanced features available in Scalar. These more advanced features include annotation tools, collaboration and editorial tools, and built-in visualizations. Janet Swatscheno is the Digital Publishing Librarian at the University of Illinois at Chicago Library. Before joining UIC, she was the Digital Publishing Specialist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Library of Congress Junior Fellow at the John W. Kluge Center. _____________________________ Register here:

Possibilities for Digital Humanities at Community Colleges | Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,"I was pleased to present today at Houston Community College’s Spring 2019 English & Humanities Colloquium on “The Digital Classroom: Humanities, Literature & Composition.” Thanks to Dr. Helen Graham for the invitation. Here are my slides. Much of the presentation is built on Dr. Anne McGrail’s work on DH and community colleges. Anne McGrail authored our keyword, Community College, for Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities! Wonderful work! https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/community_college.md I am an English faculty member at Eastfield College in the Dallas, Texas, area. We have been trying to get our digital humanities (now digital scholarship to bring in all disciplines) program off the ground for about three years. The hardest part is convincing other faculty to jump in. As the chair of the DS committee, I have been trying to find the best ways to put together a kind of flow chart for our program, to manage program goals, and to encourage faculty to incorporate DS tools, creativity, projects into their pedagogy and assignments. I am looking for more training if you have any suggestions, I would love them! I’d take a look at Anne McGrail’s materials on doing DH in a community college context, e.g. https://blogs.lanecc.edu/dhatthecc/  You might also see if there are any area THATCamps (although I don’t see any scheduled in Texas).

What jobs can you get with a master's degree in Digital Humanities?,"Back to News Home We have many flexible accelerated and graduate degrees available online. Fill out this form to get more information.  Do you have a story idea or media inquiry for Concordia’s Strategic Communications team? Send an email to news@cuaa.edu. Digital humanities is a growing field, but what jobs can you get with this degree? If you love the humanities, but are unsure about what jobs are out there, you might be surprised by the amount of opportunities.   The digital humanities incorporate a variety of fields of study, such as history, theology, philosophy, English, to name a few. The digital aspect of the digital humanities requires students to use and design digital tools. Dr. Erin Laverick, Program Director for Concordia University’s M.A. in Digital Humanities, states: “These tools allow people to research and explore ethical, social, and religious issues relevant to local and global communities.” Working in the digital humanities is truly interdisciplinary. Digital humanities could be a great fit for you if you are passionate about a certain content area, but also want to have a relevant skillset. It’s true that there are a lot of bootcamps and courses out there that could help you achieve some of the skills you might want. But, a master’s degree unlocks more opportunities for you. One key benefit to a master’s degree is the potential for a higher salary. While bootcamps and quick courses can be useful, they often lack the depth and time required to learn a subject well. Earning your master’s in Digital Humanities tells your future employer that you took a deep dive into robust course content and research. Plus, each of your professors is an expert in their field, so you can be sure you’re learning from the best.   The sky is your limit with a Master’s in Digital Humanities. These are just a few examples of jobs you can get. This specific role can be as broad or as specific as it needs to be. Some of your responsibilities include project management, managing digital archives, and developing workshops. You’ll need to stay current with technological trends and data science. Oftentimes, libraries need a Digital Humanities Specialist.    If you’d like to hone your problem-solving skills in a creative way, you should consider web design. Betterteam states that proficiency in web languages and digital tools is essential for this role. Additionally, having a background in the digital humanities will prepare you to implement what you create. Web design is all about working with people to develop a concept that is then displayed on the web. Some other non-negotiable skills are: The digital world we live in demands strategic, critical thinking and creative problem solving, especially around digital content and media. Many organizations need an expert in both communications and digital tools. Betterteam describes the role of Digital Communications specialist this way:   Fred Beecher, Director of UX at The Nerdery, explains what UX designers do like this: “The short version is that…I humanize technology.” Career Foundry listed these essential tasks for UX designers: Truity describes an archives librarian as one who “preserves important or historically significant documents and records.” The day-to-day role depends on the organization, but here are some essential tasks of the job: Truity differentiates a curator from an archivist this way: “Curators lead the acquisition, storage, and exhibition of collections.” Oftentimes, they have to negotiate the sale and acquisition of artifacts. Here are some other responsibilities: One of the cool things about studying digital humanities is that you can pursue your passion while still honing your job skills. Michelle Obama once stated that the humanities define who we are as a people. We would be honored to walk alongside you in your journey toward a greater understanding of what it means to be human in a digital world.

Scholars as Bricoleurs: The Plurality of Digital Humanities | C2DH | Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History,"While theoretical debates about the role of digital scholarship in the humanities abound, comprehensive empirical studies are relatively rare. This talk will probe digital humanities (DH) from an empirical perspective, discussing findings of an ethnographic study of 250 scholars described in the presenter’s book “Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production."" We will first look at how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies in their research workflows, focusing on scholars’ practices, needs, and challenges at different stages of the research lifecycle—from collecting and analyzing research data, to sharing and archiving research outputs. We will then examine how humanists’ digital scholarship emerges spontaneously, based on specific research or teaching needs, and, once so adopted, interacts with scholars’ research practices as a subjective process of knowledge production. In a bricolage manner, humanists construct their digital workflows from a diverse range of tools and methods suited to their preferences and needs, engaging with digital technologies in an unscripted and highly personal way that corresponds to their style of thinking and working, to their intimate epistemology. The “unruly” approach of bricolage may be outside the boundary of most DH theory, yet it is important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and engage with this variety of voices and non-canonical technology uses, paving the way for the pluralistic future of digital knowledge production in the humanities.  Dr. Smiljana Antonijević explores the intersection of communication, culture, and technology through research and teaching in the USA and Europe. She is the author of Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production (2015), while her other recent publications focus on ethnography of DH coding (2020), data ethnography (2019), Internet and trust (2019), humanists’ digital workflows (2018), and others. In addition to academic work, Smiljana is engaged in applied research in Silicon Valley, focusing on artificial intelligence, intelligent automation, and digital security.     This event is part of ""New Horizons: Confronting the Digital Turn in the Humanities"", a lecture series organised by the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).      With the kind support of

Research in times of COVID – Digital Humanities Lab,"Digital Humanities Lab Leibniz-Institut für Europäische Geschichte by Jaap Geraerts COVID-19 has posed a challenge, to put it mildly, to how most of us go about living our lives. Either in our personal life or work life, most if not all of us had to make significant adaptions in order to deal with a world that still is in the grasp of pandemic. The experience I’d like to focus on in this blog post, is that of doing research at these unprecedented times. Fairly soon after COVID-19 broke out, it became clear that it would have huge implications for researchers and teachers. Due to travel bans and other restrictions, virtually all conferences were either canceled or were held online in some form or another. In a short time span, teachers across the world had to go to extraordinary lengths to move their courses online. As libraries and archives closed their doors and traveling to or from particular countries became severely restricted or even impossible, the access to primary and secondary sources, the very fuel of our research, was hampered to a large degree.  My own experiences chime with this general picture. All the conferences I was supposed to attend were canceled and the research trip to the Netherlands that I had planned for the last week of May had to be postponed. Luckily I could work on other aspects of my current research project and spent a couple of months doing boring but necessary work on the data set that I’m preparing, work for which I rely on online databases such as this one. Finally, because most Dutch archives and libraries started opened their doors from the beginning of June and the international trains from Germany to my home country resumed their service as well, I was  able to embark on a three-week research trip in August. I certainly wasn’t able to visit all the places I originally intended. For example, the limited number of seats offered by the Dutch National Archive were already reserved long in advanced of my trip. Nor could I consult the collections of the University Library in Utrecht since it only catered for the staff and students of the university. Apart from that, however, I managed to visit a surprising amount of provincial, regional, and local archives. These were gradually opened to the public again on the condition that everyone strictly adhered to the safety measures. At Het Utrechts Archief visitors were welcomed by a large poster detailing a set of clear instructions (see image 1), while the larger reading room of the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem was equipped with a set of colourful walk lines. In both archives, plastic screens separated members of staff from visitors and made safe communication between them possible. These buildings were equipped with hand sanitizing stations as well, although in Haarlem I was told that before touching the manuscript material we actually needed to wash our hands again with normal soap (it turns out that most hand sanitizers are rather bad for the archival documents). Although operating on restricted schedules, which translated into limited opening hours and a lower number of documents one could request on a daily basis, it turned out to be possible to get a lot of research done. This should be contributed entirely to the willingness of members of staff to go beyond what they were required to do, mainly by fetching more documents than their own guidelines stipulated. Indeed, somehow archivists and librarians managed to outdo their already high levels of service that we are so accustomed to in normal times. Their dedication does not stand in isolation. Since the outbreak of the virus we have witnessed a veritable outpouring of acts of kindness among the academic community, including sharing teaching materials, offering workshops and seminar on how to teach online, and providing access to primary and secondary sources. At the same time such heart-warming acts of generosity and support – academia at its very best – contrast sharply with the economic and politic realities we face. Already before the pandemic the state of academia in many countries was rather deplorable and its future looks even more grim due to the economic and political implications of the virus. In some case the deteriorating financial situation of universities has already resulted in the large-scale sacking of staff. It’s hard to believe, but the academic job market is likely to become even worse in the foreseeable future, further swelling the ranks of the academic precariat. Alas, the cultural sector cannot expect a much brighter future, with national stimulus packages being largely diverted to other sectors. So torn between the experience of solidarity and kindness one the one hand, and the harsh political and economic realities on the other, it is not easy to make sense of this period. Still, for me there is one major takeaway from all of this: the importance of community and collaboration. In a time when the academic and cultural sectors in many countries are the victim of an astonishing lack of political will to properly fund them (if not under direct attack from (alt-right) political parties), doing research during COVID provided yet another reminder that most of the academic activities that we are engaged in are fundamental communal in nature and are simply impossible without the existence of and access to a variety of well-staffed institutions, including archives, libraries, and universities. Hopefully the importance of the sciences and humanities in dealing with the virus and addressing its many cultural, economic, and social implications, will convince the powers that be that investing in the people and institutions that underpin and enable academic research and teaching is perhaps not such a bad idea after all.

"Digital Access, Inclusion, and the Humanities | School of Advanced Study","Convenors: Dr Naomi Wells, Early Career Researcher in Italian and Spanish with Digital Humanities, Institute of Modern Languages Research, School of Advanced Study and Professor Jane Winters, Professor of Digital Humanities, School of Advanced Study Across the world in 2020, the Covid-19 crisis led to the closure of the physical spaces where people engage in and with humanities research. University buildings, libraries, museums and archives were shuttered for more than a third of the year in the UK, and have only gradually been able to welcome back staff, students and visitors. Even twenty years ago, the impact of the pandemic on our ability to conduct research, to collaborate, to access cultural heritage and to share knowledge would have been devastating. Today, we have the web, social media, digitised collections of documents and objects, video and audio conferencing, online classrooms and MOOCs. All of these tools and more have been deployed to allow people to access from home the best that the humanities have to offer.   
But how equal is this access? How many children have been disadvantaged because they do not have their own computer or a reliable internet connection? How many of the university students learning and researching from home or in halls of residence have been able to consult the digitised collections that they need? Who has decided what does and does not warrant digitisation, and how much access to digitised material will cost? What is the impact of copyright, IPR and legal deposit legislation on people’s ability to work with digital sources? How evenly are the disadvantages and opportunities spread across different groups in society, and between different nations?

This conversation will explore the enormous value of digital tools and platforms in enabling, promoting and developing the humanities at a time of crisis, but it will also consider how the humanities can help us to examine the challenges and pitfalls of the digital.

Taking a walk (or a stroll?) through digital humanities – Digital History Methods,"Digital History Methods HIST 477/677 American University This may be an odd question, but how would you describe the way that you walk or move around in the world? Do you hold a certain posture? Does it depend on the people, places, and things surrounding you? According to Joanna Guldi, the way a person’s style of walking is described can carry a lot of contextual and cultural information, especially in London during the 19th century. Guldi used databases and keyword variants to research the cultural change through walking habits in her article “The History of Walking and the Digital Turn.” Making use of Google Book Search, The Making of the Modern World (MMW) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) databases, she explored the shifting terminology to reveal the changing discourse of walking in 19th century London. Guldi noticed expressions such as “lurching,” “dodging,” and “waddling” grew in popularity over time. She also observed a contrast between the use of the words “lounge” and “stride” that reflected “the struggle between aristocratic and middle-class views of city, strangers, and the body.” On the other hand, the word “slodge” appeared in 1829 to describe “a drunken, foot-dragging walk, with all the poverty and dissolution such a posture could imply.” After examining the change of language over time through digital tools, Guldi asks other historians to establish new methodologies to glean additional information from digital database resources. Did Guldi’s methods change the way that you view historical texts? Continuing the conversation of “big data” that we started last week, have you come across historians incorporating similar methods in their research? Ben Schmidt, who is currently the Director of Digital Humanities at New York University, also enjoyed experimenting with digital analysis tools. For one of his projects, he used Google Ngram to investigate the extent of anachronistic language in the popular British historical drama Downton Abbey. In his blog post “Making Downton more traditional,” shared his process of checking every single line of the show’s script for historical accuracy by running every two-word phrase through the Google Ngram database. (For a great overview of Google Ngram, check out Rosie’s blog post!) Schmidt gave a list of 34 anachronistic phrases that appeared in season 3 of the show. I have never seen Downton Abbey, and I was surprised to see the phrase “unicorn if” on the list. Schmidt also found that every episode included dozens of phrases following speech patterns that were more consistent with teenagers’ language during the 1990s than the characters in the show. The characters’ phrasing was not the only anachronistic aspect of the show. Schmidt acknowledged that “the sensibilities are obviously modern, easy for us to understand, and false to the reality of the past.” A couple of the commenters also discussed the show’s use of contemporary phrases to create a historical drama that appealed to modern audiences. (This may be an aside from the main analysis of the readings, but do you agree with the commenters? What is the balance between historical accuracy and appealing to contemporary audiences?) Guldi’s and Schmidt’s use of text databases and digital analysis tools demonstrate a facet of digital humanities’ many capabilities.  In the article “Digital visualization as a scholarly activity,” Martyn Jessop shares a variety of methods for visualizing information through images, diagrams, and animations to communicate messages. Visualization is not only a method for viewing information, but also a method for studying information. This includes examining spatial relationships, quantitative analysis, temporal relationships, and 3D visualizations of built environments. Are there some forms of data visualization that work better than others? Additionally,  Jessop claims that digital visualization’s greatest value is “not for analysis, but for synthesis and modelling.” Do you agree with Jessop’s assertion? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Mia, I think it can be appropriate to mix contemporary language in historical shows to make it more relatable. It helps viewers connect, but it has to be done well and the emphasis still has to be on presenting the information.  As far as data visualization it is an important tool that again can help viewers connect to the information. For me, it is much easier to see a space drawn out than see numbers listed. I do agree that it is great for synthesis and modeling but it can be useful for analysis as well. Some people are visual learners and understand better through visualization rather than numbers or words. Hi Amanda!  I think I usually feel the same way about connecting with visualizations that show space drawn out over those that show numbers listed. I feel like the context of the visualizations also informs the forms types of visualization for the project.  With Schmidt’s blog post, I kind of found the charts a little difficult to understand at first with the “over representation” versus “overall frequency” axes. I am also curious if there were other ways that he tried visualizing the data before he settled on the charts he put in the blog.   Were there any of the visualizations from the readings that you felt like you connected with  better than others? Mia, I really liked your question about historical accuracy vs. contemporary appeal–I think it is a good thing to think about! As someone who watched all of Downton Abbey (at the request of my mother but also, who am I kidding, I loved it) I can say that the historical appeal of the show wasn’t in their language, but rather in the visual depictions of a lost world and the relationships between the characters. While I think that historical accuracy is absolutely necessary in most places, TV shows that do their best and still make larger points about socioeconomic designations, war, and historical experience don’t need to live up to an academic standard. I would wager that very few individuals watch Downton Abbey to have an immersive historical experience. Most watch Downton Abbey to feel like they are part of a wealthy British world where kind servants bring you tea in the middle of the day. Ultimately, historians can (and should) contribute to conversations about historical accuracy in TV shows, but the struggle lies in creating something relatable to modern audiences. My mother had to look words and events up while watching Downton Abbey (and The Crown as well)–she learned about historical trends and vocabulary and lifestyle, and I think that is a pretty good accomplishment from a TV series. Hi Shae! Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Downton Abbey. Maybe I’ll give it a watch in the future! It’s awesome to hear about the ways that you and your mom connected with the show and learned more about historical lifestyles. It feels like most audiences take the history portrayed in historical dramas with a grain of salt anyways, and it could prompt people do some more research into the history after enjoying the show.  Were there any moments where you felt uneasy with the show’s portrayal of the past or found the anachronisms that Schmidt mentioned jarring? Yes I felt the same way about Downton Abbey when reading this. As an avid watcher of period pieces I don’t watch them for historical accuracy but instead for the simple entertainment of becoming invested in the lives of fictional characters and experiencing their adventures on screen. I love history but I do agree with Mia that it seems, for the most part, that period pieces take historical accuracy with a grain of salt to leave enough room for their creative take that will most definitely appeal to their modern audience. But for the sake of this class, it is fascinating that Schmidt could breakdown the language and cross reference it. Your email address will not be published.

Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon 2021 #DH­H21 | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki,"The Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon is a chance to experience an interdisciplinary research project from start to finish within the span of 10 days. For researchers and students from computer science and data science, the hackathon gives the opportunity to test their abstract knowledge against complex real-life problems. For people from the humanities and social sciences, it shows what is possible to achieve with such collaboration. 
 
For both, the hackathon gives the experience of intensely working with people from different backgrounds as part of an interdisciplinary team, as, during the hackathon, each group develops a digital humanities research project from start to finish. Working together, they formulate research questions with respect to particular data sets, develop and apply methods and tools to answer them, and present the work at the end of the hackathon. For information on what the hackathon was like in previous years, see #DHH19, #DHH18, #DHH17, #DHH16 and #DHH15. In 2021, the event was organized as an online hackathon. As a CLARIN, DARIAH and SSHOC summer school, the event was truly international, welcoming applications from all over Europe and beyond! Participation to #DHH is free to all accepted participants. 3–6 ECTS credits may be gained from participating in the hackathon for students in University of Helsinki and other universities. This year, the hackathon groups organized around the following seven themes, each of which has now been linked to the final output report written by the group (for the initial background presentations on the themes, see here). output: Eighteenth-Century English Versions of Pierre Bayle’s Dictionary: A Computational Study
 The hackathon took place between 19.–28.5.2021. The participants were expected to commit to the hackathon for the whole period; work took place mainly between 10 AM and 5 PM (Finland / EEST / UTC+03:00) on weekdays (the weekend was free!). In addition, there were three pre-sessions on Tuesdays 27.4., 4.5. and 11.5., between 2 – 4 PM for orientation, group formation and preparation for the intensive hackathon period. The participants were expected to attend also these pre-sessions. For more details, see the detailed timetable and further information on practicalities (including prerequisites and credits for students). Public presentations of the projects:

Data Literacy as Digital Humanities Literacy: Exploration of Threshold Concepts ← dh+lib,"where the digital humanities and librarianship meet For those who are both librarians and digital humanities instructors, we must either create new frameworks for teaching and learning or attempt to map existing ones to library instruction. “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance. Below, I propose threshold concepts for data literacy and illustrate how those concepts can provide a lens through which we can explore a piece of digital humanities scholarship. Defining threshold concepts will be useful in communication among digital humanists and our daily pedagogical work. To illustrate the application of these threshold concepts, I explore the data visualization project, Torn Apart/Separados, through a data literacy lens. The project team has clearly documented and shared their data collection processes and acknowledge the data’s limitations. Through these means, they invite a critical assessment of the data and its use, an overarching principle of data literacy (Calzada Prado & Marzal, 2013). “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance.
To discuss the utility of threshold concepts in data literacy, we must start from a shared understanding of them. Threshold concepts represent information previously not known by the learner, and once a person learns and understands that information, it permanently and drastically changes their perception of the topic (Meyer, Land & Baillie, 2010). A person who understands a threshold concept can ask more precise questions and will exhibit certain behaviors that show a deep level of understanding. “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance. Data literacy, broadly, is the ability to critically create, manipulate, manage, analyze, understand, and communicate data (Koltay, 2014; Calzada Prado & Marzal, 2013; Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). Based on relevant work in data literacy and digital humanities, and topics I’ve found to be pertinent in my teaching, I propose and discuss preliminary threshold concepts for data literacy in digital humanities below. I’ve used these as a basis for defining learning outcomes and assessing students’ learning around working with humanities data. These concepts are understanding data as human and/or machine created information, recognizing data as only one part of a narrative, and the role of data in scholarship. Data is not inherently objective, even when created through a seemingly objective process.  Key questions for exploration Information literacy sessions typically cover familiar forms of knowledge dissemination, like books and presentations, which are directly created by humans. Data, on the other hand, can be created or simply influenced by humans. Increasingly, computational systems may not need direct input to create data (think a timestamp on a saved file), or they can create new information based on previous input (think machine learning). Even lacking direct input, the system programmer decides when one thing happens, another thing must be true, or a behavioral researcher decides one variable is important to collect while another is not. Data is always affected by human intervention, even if a human did not directly create it. As such, data is not inherently more objective than a journal article or conference talk, though we often hear that students tend to see data in this way (Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). As much as we try to remove bias from our computing processes, decisions made during the creation process influence the final dataset because “people choose what to count or measure” (Schield, 2004, pp. 7). Data in Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 is gathered from multiple governmental sources, including the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division, and restructured to fit the needs of the project. One variable that ICE collects on its detainees is whether they are “criminal.” An early learner of data literacy might accept that information as fact, without asking more questions about how the value of “criminal” is determined. Criminal is a loaded term with meaning that can vary based on cultural, societal, and even demographic factors (do we consider a child who steals candy a “criminal”?). Which crimes earn a “criminal” signifier? A data literate person will ask questions about how the value is determined, who assigns the value, and what societal factors might influence the value. These are research questions in their own right, and the answers are not always readily (if at all) available. However, when learners understand the process of data creation as wholly guided by humans, they think critically about that process and how that affects any data they examine. These effects can be mitigated by supplementing a data-based result with other pieces of information. Data is one piece of a whole narrative, and cannot give a complete picture alone. Key questions for exploration Data serves as a “snapshot” representation of a particular reality. Because of the notion that data is inherently objective, we tend to believe data-driven conclusions more readily than other forms of knowledge (Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset. The ability to act when data is absent, and to understand the limitations of data-driven analysis, will continue to be highly desirable skills for all workers, not just those in DH (Davies, Fidler & Gorbis, 2020). A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset.
The base data visualization in Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 tells us that ICE-affiliated detention centers are widespread, which are in use, and some are not, the average daily population, and other characteristics. None of this factual information demonstrates how these centers can operate, a question which the project team set out to answer. Volume 2 analyzes the flow of money between ICE, government officials, and the contractors who complete work for them. This additional piece of information draws the story closer to a complete picture of the current state of immigration policy and enforcement in the US. A data literate person can effectively use the information in both Volumes 1 and 2 to draw correlations between operating costs and facility use, which was impossible without the new information Volume 2 provides. All of this information, from the data to the interpretations presented, are equally integral parts of the research process. A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset. Data is an artifact of the iterative process of research.  Key questions for exploration In digital humanities projects, data can appear both as the subject and product of research. Considering Christof Schöch’s distinction between “big” and “smart” data in the humanities is useful here, wherein big data is relatively unstructured but massive, and smart data is more structured and relatively small (Schöch, 2013). A dataset created by a DH researcher that is new, unique, and derived from multiple information sources is “smart” data. Like a published article, the dataset itself is an integral part of the research process. Findable, reusable, and well-preserved data ensures reproducibility and enables others to ask similar questions. A data literate person understands the flow of data from original source, to researcher, to final presented dataset, and knows how to find information on how the data was modified and recreated at each stage. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners.
Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 visualizes structured data garnered directly from other sources on a map for exploration and interpretation (another example of “smart” data). The original data is gathered from various organizations, and the cleaned, reformatted versions are preserved on the project’s GitHub repository. Project documentation explains the information in the dataset and its original sources. In this case, data is both the subject and product of research. A data literate researcher reusing or examining the project’s data can easily find documentation on how the data was modified throughout the project and, thus, gains a critical understanding of the process of data creation, transformation, and presentation. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners. These concepts are meant to serve as preliminary benchmarks to gauge learners’ critical understanding of data creation, use, analysis, and sharing.

Skill level: BeginnerPrerequisites/requirements: Google Chrome and Firefox top Instructor: Nada AmmaguiDate: Thursday, February 11, 2021Time: 1000-1200 EST | 1900-2100 GST  Google Sheets is a web-based spreadsheet program, equivalent in some ways to Microsoft Excel, with a wide array of features and uses. For people who would like to embark on a digital humanities project, it is one of many options for organizing data. This workshop is aimed at total beginners and will introduce a few ways to facilitate automatic data entry, organization, and visualization on Google Sheets. The skills presented in this workshop are suitable for anyone working with spreadsheets, and apply for any project in which there is repeated information (names, places, objects, dates). We will learn to sort and filter data, auto-populate cells, and organize sheets visually. The workshop is in three parts: first, an overview of Google Sheets and potential use cases (e.g., art exhibitions over time, books authored by a publishing house); second, a detailed explanation of some of Google Sheets’ features (Code Tables, Data Validation, Conditional Formatting, VLookup, Column Stats and Filters, and Pivot Tables); and third, a walk-through of these tools using a sample data set. Participants can follow along with the walk-through by using their own data or the sample set provided. Skill level: Total BeginnerPrerequisites/requirements: Basic familiarity with Google Sheets or Excel. The course will be carried out using Google Sheets. You will be added to a shared sheet using the email address that you provide for the registration, so a Google account is required. Participants can also observe the process without using the Sheets and can use their own data set to practice the skills learned. top Instructor: Victor WestrichDate: Tuesday, February 9, 2021Time: 1300-1500 EST | 2200-2400 GST This course will focus on using the programming language R as a way of visualizing spatial data. It will use four humanities datasets (pre-modern and modern, from Europe and the Middle East) and provide participants with the code required to carry out the visualization. We will discuss how participants might match different kinds of spatial datasets for different visualizations in Shiny. We will approach the visualization process in four steps: (1) discussing what the “story” of our data is, and which aspects or conclusions from it we want to illuminate via visualization. (2) preprocessing our data into a dataset. Here it is especially important to determine the aspects of a given dataset, i.e. if a two-faceted approach is satisfactory or if a more faceted approach (e.g. temporospatial) is required. (3) choosing the clearest and most efficient visual representation for our dataset. (4) selecting the most viable user interface to maximize accessibility and impact of our visualization. Skill level: IntermediatePrerequisites/requirements: Basic familiarity with Leaflet & a programming language such as R. The course will be carried out using RStudio Cloud. You will be added to an account using the email address that you provide for the registration and you will need to activate it by responding to an email before the session. Participants can also observe the process without being added to RStudio Cloud. top Instructor: Nicholas WolfDate:  Thursday, February 11, 2021Time: 1800-2000 EST | 0300-0500 GST (12 Feb)  This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to construct their own digital text corpus for conducting humanities data analysis. We’ll cover simple tools for turning printed texts in a variety of languages into computer-readable files, the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, and consider helpful tools for post-process correction of digitized texts. We’ll also look at open-access text-as-data sources available over simple web-browser-based API calls. The workshop is geared toward digital humanists needing to assemble text data that are not yet compiled or in computer readable form for analysis, and who are looking for an introduction to the workflows and software suited to building the research materials needed for analysis. We’ll learn how to use Tesseract, an open-source OCR software, consider the anatomy of an HOCR file (the output of OCR efforts), and deploy techniques for extracting structured information from a page. Skill level: IntermediatePrerequisites/requirements: Familiarity with using a web browser, willingness to try out some short command-line steps with guidance, interest in text-as-data analysis projects. Participants should have a computer with a text editor installed such as BBEdit, TextWrangler, Atom, Notepad++ or the like; administrator access to install open-source software (Tesseract). top Copyright © 2022 · Executive Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in",https://wp.nyu.edu/widh/widhnycdh-2021/
Opening the Anthropocene Archives - Public Books,"We are living astride two epochs in geological time. The first, the Holocene, began about 11,700 years ago; the second, the Anthropocene, now defines our troubled present. In a 2002 article, the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer suggested that we have entered a new era in geological time called the Anthropocene epoch. This shift to a “human-dominated, geological epoch” is significant, according to Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin, because the “impacts of human activity” will be “observable in the geological stratigraphic record for millions of years to come.”1
And yet, the Anthropocene has all too often been conceived in narrowly physical terms, such as rock layers and glacier ice. These physical records are undoubtedly crucial to understanding whether humanity has measurably affected the earth system. But deep analysis of digitized historical archives can allow us to understand how and why these changes occurred. Bridging the divide between scientific and humanistic understandings can only enrich the scientific models of this new human age.
Since the Anthropocene has been triggered by human actions, we can see a detailed record of those world-making activities in the newly accessible form of digitized archives. These were previously locked in libraries that required sleuthing, on the order of The Da Vinci Code or Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, through dusty manuscripts. And even though libraries and cultural-heritage institutions have spent millions of dollars over decades to digitize their holdings, still, they have mostly been used to pursue conventional humanities questions. How can we use these digital archives to envision the contribution of humanistic work on the scale of geological time, rather than just on the scale of literary history, canons, or periodization?








As one example, our Digital History of the Anthropocene project uses recent advances in digital-humanities methods, perhaps best known for their application to language patterns in literary texts, to mine these historical digitized archives in order to better understand what people since 1610 (one of the candidate years for the start of the Anthropocene) have been thinking about, discussing, and debating—how to define the idea of the earth and man’s changing place on it.
Put another way, the Anthropocene has long been discussed in terms of hard science. Yet, if it is an age caused and created by humans, then the Anthropocene must also be examined from all human perspectives. What, then, do the humanities have to teach about the Anthropocene?
Our archives are no longer stacks of historical documents for posterity. They contain an understanding of history as a geologic record written by the human hand.
The Anthropocene has provoked a far-reaching debate among scholars from a wide range of fields spanning the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The historian Dipesh Chakrabarty has prompted us to grapple with the sobering knowledge that human society has an effect beyond the passing of generations, or even civilizations—how can we conceptualize the collective impact of our activities within the staggering scale of geological time? How can we begin to fathom our future obsolescence by imagining our place in the fossil record alongside the dinosaurs?
For scientists, however, these existential issues have been pushed aside for more prosaic matters: In what year did this Anthropocene present start? In May 2019, the Anthropocene Working Group, composed of scientists from the International Commission on Stratigraphy, voted to approve the mid-20th century—the time range now recognized as inaugurating the atomic age and the “great acceleration” of society’s impact on the environment—as the officially recommended origin point of the Anthropocene period.
However, a backlash emerged from this dating, with scholars from a wide range of perspectives and disciplines arguing that it is far too early to set a date in stone. Although scientists are well equipped to understand if chemical forces shaping the physical and geographic record across time are present and measurable, they do not understand how and why humans caused such changes.
To understand these underlying causes, we must attend carefully to the human social and cultural record that describes, over time, how human beings have reshaped the earth. Our archives are no longer stacks of historical documents for posterity. These archives now contain an understanding of history as a geologic record written by the human hand.
Geologists and climate scientists have recently called for a broader debate, in order to define a more historically sensitive vision of the Anthropocene that engages, in the words of Erle Ellis, the “diverse array” of “material records of human alterations of Earth,”2 from records in historical and cultural archives that are as necessary to an understanding of the Anthropocene as are stratigraphic rock layers.

Why an Age of Machine Learning Needs the...
By Ted Underwood
						







Digital History of the Anthropocene focused on the Renaissance, because we have a good historical understanding of this time period; 1610 was nearing the end of Shakespeare’s dramatic career, and we have an abundance of digitized records, including scanned and transcribed texts from Early English Books Online, a digital archive of up to 130,000 texts from this time, and the HathiTrust Digital Library, which contains over 17 million volumes from the medieval period to the present day.
To work through these large digital archives, we adapted a range of machine-learning algorithms for text analysis. These were originally built for search engines and for social-media-platform ranking and filtering but can be retuned to identify large-scale trends within historical archives. The algorithm’s methods all work by identifying groups of words that have a very high likelihood of coexisting near one another within the sentences, paragraphs, and whole books composing the archives. These methods help us understand words and phrases as they were actually used and as they signified “in the wild” of human culture.
We used these methods to ask questions of the scientific rationale and the underlying historical assumptions for the different dates previous geological and chemical studies have proposed. Did Renaissance culture naively raze the natural world for the sake of inexorable technological and economic progress, as some origin narratives of the modern world and climate change begin? Like Dr. Seuss’s Once-ler character, who gained a self-conscious awareness of the error of his ways far too late to restore his ecosystem, can we, today, perceive man’s effect on the earth in a way that previous generations could not? Is this self-awareness of our ability to change the earth, which we now call the Anthropocene, a feature of our modern, technologically enriched and scientifically advanced era?
The Renaissance understanding of latitude, sunlight, and time was the original definition of “climate.”
What we found, in response to these questions, was more complex than what we had expected. We unearthed a fundamentally different Renaissance worldview and a bizarrely unexpected definition of life as it inhabits the earth. These ideas reshaped our understanding of the historical conditions at the beginnings of the Anthropocene epoch.
Our models persistently clustered words such as latitude, climate, zones, tropics, poles, complexion, and equinoctial in books from a wide, and seemingly unrelated, group of genres. As we examined these results, we saw that the common thread linking all of these words, phrases, and texts was a commonly assumed Renaissance earth system.
This system defined life across the globe in terms of the latitude bands dividing the globe into navigable global space. A latitude defines the amount of sunlight per day an area receives from the sun, with each degree of latitude representing increments of daylight. This system of latitude, sunlight, and time was the original definition of “climate.”
Rather than the long-term weather patterns we describe today, climate—in the Renaissance—was the spatial organization of the earth’s surface into latitude zones with a measurable amount of sunlight. This organization, in turn, dictated the environmental conditions of locations situated along that degree, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Most importantly, such an organization demonstrated—to the Renaissance mind—what plants and animals could survive and thrive in these places.

Strikingly, our models also repeatedly linked places and texts about a jumble of locations that seemed to have no relationship, and which we feared were spurious results. Books and passages about Virginia, Portugal, Spain, India, and China were grouped together in our models. This indicated that these locations shared similar word and phrase patterns, and that these texts used similar descriptive language for all of these places.
Unlike now, when our organization of the globe is by continents, or by hemispheric divisions such as “east/west” or “old world / new world,” in 1610 the world was organized by degrees of latitude. Locations along a latitude band would conceivably share more in common than locations at different latitudes on the same continent, or in adjacent nations. And so, in geographical explorations of the nascent Virginia colonies, Englishmen leaned on a comparative worldview that made sense of the new world in terms of other places at the same latitude. Such globalized thinking led to speculation that silk could grow profitably in Jamestown, because it shared the same climate as China.
This strange vitalist vision was able to closely affiliate two places 10s of thousands of miles apart, and it forced early-modern humans to define humanity and society in a fundamental relationship to the earth and its climate.

This may sound akin to an Edenic innocence, in which people were more attuned to the rhythms of the natural world. This interpretation, however, was not what we found in our models, which often contained results that were far darker.
The Renaissance definition—climate as a basis for biology at a global scale—was the principle upon which England built its idea of empire, by setting the parameters for how flora and fauna could be moved and transplanted across the earth in order to establish stable colonies. Climate was the spatial blueprint upon which England built colonial trade and its outposts—purposefully, along latitude bands, where living things could be easily exchanged.
Based on our experiments mining the digitized archives of the Renaissance, poring over texts—both famous and obscure—we found that the Anthropocene era and the global movement of life that triggered a global drop in carbon dioxide identified by scientists at the time was not a byproduct of colonialism. It was the motivation for colonialism itself.

Swimming in the Anthropocene
By Steve Mentz
						







Apart from exploring digitized historical archives from the Renaissance era, we are also expanding our research to examine literary and historical archives from the 20th century to understand the discourse around the mid-20th-century dating of the Anthropocene, as a more contemporary correlate to the historical analysis we have conducted for the 1610 dating. And we are using these methods on government environmental and weather data, as well as plant archives, to understand whether or not we can extract useful information from archival datasets to assess chemical and physical changes in the earth system.
We have designed our project as an example of the digital humanities whose primary goal is not to produce new readings of literary texts—many scholars already do this well. Rather, these methods scour our text archives for patterns of meaning and worldviews and debates that we have lost today, which challenge our assumptions about humans and their role in shaping the planet.

Neotopology | Digital Humanities at Stanford,"This is part of a talk I gave at #txdhc. It leaves out ""principles of interloping in network science"" which I'll try to put in a later post. When I was invited to give a talk at The Texas Digital Humanities Consortium's First Annual Conference about networks and specifically networks in the humanities, I asked myself the same thing I did when I was asked to write D3.js in Action: how can I speak on something for which I don't have a degree? How can I write a book about programming when I don't have a degree in computer science? Similarly, how can I give a talk about networks when I don't have a degree in network science? Obviously, I have some experience with networks, such as my work representing topic models as a network.  I’ve noticed, in the past, when I’ve given more involved talks or papers dealing with networks, that I find both my audience and myself more comfortable with focusing on network representation, commonly referred to as network visualization. The network visualization of the results of a topic model is rather effective and sophisticated, I think, but I also don't have a degree in design or information science, so once again I'm outside of my domain of credentialed expertise. So, sometimes I dodge that position and focus on the use of networks in the publication of research. Networks as a rhetorical device, in tandem with text and maps, especially in the genre of interactive scholarly works, like Kindred Britain, and especially its Stories component, that ties together text, maps, networks, and other data visualization.  But I'm not a publisher, and have never worked for a publisher. So, I fall back on my old standby, ORBIS, and instead focus more on transportation networks and especially historical transportation networks.  But I also don't have a degree in geography or in classics. Like many people who shift away from their original domain of expertise into a well-defined field with its own journals and conferences, I begin to feel like there’s really only one subject with which I might treat as an expert: Imposter Syndrome. But there are examples of successful practitioners working in fields like this with a wealth of established research. After all, Franco Moretti is not a statistician. Or, as you may have heard it stated: Franco Moretti is not a statistician!!!!!!11!111oneone!one And while he may not be a statistician, neither is he an imposter. Rather, like me, and like many people in digital humanities, he is an interloper. And so that’s what I’m here to talk about: Interloping. I think interloping, more than computational approaches or the digital broadly construed as the object of study, defines digital humanities. And scholars are not the only ones interloping. We find ourselves awash in accessible, powerful tools and techniques that seem well-suited for our research and entice us into fields and disciplines with which we haven’t the wealth of domain expertise that we do in our primary fields. It means that we approach these techniques in a naive manner, but as humanists, we have recourse to this seeming impediment. Yes, when you first begin to model your study of literature using networks, you do so as a beginner. But, as Shunryu Suzuki notes in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, this perspective is open to possibilities in a way that the better versed may not be. This approach is idealistic, I am not. I know, from experience, that the interloper is constantly exposed to critique for using methods naively, for not understanding basic principles of the research method and existing scholarship, and for suggesting narratives that clash with the traditional understanding of a field. There are, however, several mitigating factors when it comes to the principles of interloping in network science. The first requires a detour into geography. I know you didn’t sign up for a geography lecture, and so I’ll keep it short, but in my defense, I’m always mentioning networks when I talk about geography, so at least I’m consistently disappointing. I titled my talk neotopology because I believe that this network turn resembles the spatial turn in more ways than one. One of those ways is the presence of a vibrant community of practice growing outside the traditional domains where in one case network analysis/visualization and in the other case spatial analysis/visualization traditionally occurs. Neogeography, in short, refers to the use of cartographic and spatial analytic tools and techniques by designers, humanists, software developers and others outside of the traditional domains of GIS, GIScience and cartography. It has, at times, caused some consternation and led to fierce claims both in digital humanities and in the tech industry that the geographic information systems being developed by such interlopers are, ""Not GIS"". It has also elicited, from time to time, angry responses from these traditional domains directed at flaneurs running amok with ArcGIS and Google Maps API. Which itself has also spurred defensiveness.  But neogeography has produced incredible work, including the amazing Voronoi experiments that Jason Davies has been creating, satellite projected views of the US/Mexico border by Mike Bostock, and incredible innovation in the tile space, such as base maps that look like wood inlay, or Stamen's watercolor map here enhanced with semi-transparent satellite imagery for great effect:  Add to this online mapping applications developed in fan culture, such as that of the LOTR Project, and we can see a vibrant community of practice in a world once dominated by GIS Professionals and GIScience academics. While neogeography is a product of broad accessibility of GIS tools and techniques, it is further defined by its strong integration with information visualization. Geospatial information visualization refers to something besides maps and atlases, it refers, I would argue, to the primacy of a system or model for which the geospatial data is just one view into that model. There’s another thing that neogeography has in common with neotopology, and which allows me to end my geography detour: humanists are not the only interlopers in the field. In the same way that journalists, designers and software developers and humanities scholars have flooded into spatial analysis and visualization, the same groups are flooding into network analysis and visualization.     Here we see three examples among many. The first is Mike Bostock, creator of the D3.js information visualization library and award-winning journalist at the New York Times, taking a network perspective on the Oscars. The second is designer Christian Swinehart's amazing exploration of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novels, where the network connects passages in the novel based on the decision points at the ends of those passages, with gruesome endings in vivid color. The last is the result of my own look into the way in which TV Tropes works are connected by shared tropes, and what it might mean to bridge the disparate genres explored by that community. But there are striking differences in the situation surrounding the spatial turn and the situation surrounding the network turn. When the Anne Knowles edited Past Time, Past Place: GIS for History was published, it was 12 years ago. This was four years before Twitter, two years before Facebook and a time when English Wikipedia had only 20,000 articles. In 2002, scholars like Willard McCarty in ""Humanities Computing: Essential Problems, Experimental Practice"" were not even referring to digital humanities, but rather ""humanities computing"" and ""computer assisted humanities"": ...through Galison’s metaphor of the trading zone, it gives depth of meaning to the often ad hoc and ill-understood practice of collaboration in the computer-assisted humanities: it helps us to understand how people from very different fields can do laboratory-based research well--do research better than alone, or at all--while remaining undiluted intellectually… Most notably for humanist scholars trying to use GIS, they had access to either a very user unfriendly ArcGIS 8, or write their own code. Google Earth was an obscure hermeneutic toy known as Earthviewer 3D, created by a company you likely never heard of. And it's not even fair to peg Past Time, Past Place to 2002, since this volume was a collection of essays that occurred after an enthusiastic adoption from which we can extrapolate an even earlier date of sophisticated engagement. We are so early in the Network Turn that there has appeared, as yet, no comparable volume for networks. Our only real landmark comparison for Networks in Humanities is Tim Tangherlini’s “Networks and Network Analysis for the Humanities” funded by the NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities. It included participation by academics such as Katy Borner, Franco Moretti and Dave Blei, but also industry interlopers like Fernando Diaz, then senior research scientist at Yahoo! Research and now at Microsoft Research. In contrast to the bleak situation 12 years ago, we began making this network turn in a dramatically different ecosystem. This is not to say there are not conferences with the aim of focusing on networks in the humanities, such as Arts, Humanities, and Complex Networks, a satellite symposium at NetSci that's been running for five years. Rather, I mean that network analysis in digital humanities scholarship is so early on that it hasn't even managed to put together and publish a single edited volume. There is another, and for academics sharper, contrast. The network turn, after all, is taking place after the spatial turn. That means it's taking place with a model for how to respond to collaboration and colonization by a method and its attendent experts. And while there are rich reflections on what it means to bring spatial analysis in contact with humanities scholarship it is even more readily apparent in the covers and titles of similar volumes published since Past Time, Past Place, most of which do not have covers featuring maps made with GIS packages but rather word clouds, the Peutinger table (neogeography from the Roman world), or abstract paintings. As digital humanities scholarship continues to mature, the old call to authority about how to use digital objects, tools and related techniques is not so intimidating. We learned, as we deconstructed GIS and NLP, that we could use these things, too. The spatial turn was not about historians learning GIS, it was about everyone getting access to a host of geospatial data, tools and techniques, and then doing whatever they wanted with it, until they felt perfectly comfortable doing ""GIS"" or not. It was not that GIS could not handle the fuzziness, incompleteness, and uncertainty of humanities scholarship, but that the practitioners who had built and designed (and to be fair to many, generously taught us) traditional mapping and GIS tools simply had not thought of it. It was up to the interlopers to address these approaches and develop methods to deal with them.  We will not follow the same path with network analysis, because the environment today is thus vastly different. And there’s something even more fundamental about networks that makes us, as interlopers, more equipped to adopt and adapt them: Networks are simple. Networks are whatever you define them as, within a basic set of attributes. While there are best practices insofar as how to constrain and structure a network, it is fundamentally a view of the phenomenon you wish to study--a network perspective. You will often hear that you cannot use, for instance, an n-partite network, or a hypergraph. But that advice is from the perspective of computing across the network to measure centrality, clustering, modularity and other traditional network measures. If you’re using a network as a supplement, as a view into your work that emphasizes the structure rather than the components, and you’re not computing centrality, then it is valid if only as part of a dialectical examination in tension with your traditional scholarship. A network is a view of a system that preferences the importance of connections between objects in that system and the emergent properties of those connections when examined in the aggregate in a way distinct from a demographic or biographic or geographic perspective typical in humanities scholarship. This is, I think, where we shine as humanists and interlopers. Our work with networks is not our sole methodology or concern, and our engagement with networks reflects that in the same way that our engagement with spatial analysis has. Are more central people more likely to also have stronger metadata? Does betweenness correlate with nationality? And how does it compare to the networks and network structures discovered or created not only by other academics, but by those created by journalists and in fan culture and in industry? To return to this definition of digital humanities as interloping, it serves to go back to McCarty's examination of the Trading Zone: In his magisterial study, Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics, Galison shows us in detail how individuals engaged in a bundle of rather disparate activities came together and successfully collaborated to solve the most difficult experimental problems of their day. His historiography is centred on the machinery these activities had in common (e.g. the devices invented to study subatomic interactions) and the users’ intellectual and pragmatic negotiations of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. He proposes and develops an anthropological-linguistic analogy for these negotiations, which he calls the Trading Zone. In a typical trading zone people from mutually incomprehensible cultures come together to trade objects of interest. To do that, as in fact happens, they develop a highly restricted proto-language or pidgin for their negotiations. This pidgin allows them to reach agreement among themselves about objects of trade even though outside of the zone, within their own cultures, their understandings and uses of these objects differ radically. We are, in our engagement with networks, interloping. But network science teaches us that the interlopers, the people who connect disparate, unconnected groups, derive power from that position. I think all of us, after thinking deeply about networks, have had it influence the way that we engage in the networks we take part in. The network turn itself is one of those networks. Notes from the talk: 1. There was some controversy over whether network analysis is ""the trading zone"" and whether one can reasonably refer to a network science. I must admit to using network science in a very pragmatic manner, simply meaning it to stand in as a blanket statement for social network analysis, transportation network analysis, and various disparate but established fields and sub-disciplines that have used networks for decades. 2. Insofar as I mean ""the network turn"" I'm not referring to the application of network analysis by any research agenda, since obviously scholars in a number of fields have long been using network analysis. Rather, I refer to the widespread adoption of network analysis and visualization by humanities scholars to address traditional humanities research questions. 3.

During a time when disrupted classes, cancelled exams, and interrupted research became the norm, it would have been expected to see resources like Gale Primary Sources or Gale Digital Scholar Lab experience a decline in usage, since module leaders had less time to teach students and researchers how to use them. Read our Gale Digital Scholar Lab Impact Report to see what we found out... The Gale Review includes Digital Humanities related blog posts written by our publishing teams, guest academics and student ambassadors as they unearth fascinating primary sources that have yet to be studied – or explore frequently studied topics from exciting new angles.     Recordings of DH webinars that Gale have hosted are now available.  Focusing on teaching, researching and supporting DH, these webinars look at some of the challenges faced by universities, faculty and libraries around the world.    Learn how the Gale Digital Scholar Lab has successfully enabled a university to enhance and accelerate introductory undergraduate modules in Digital Humanities.  As part of the Bodleian Visiting Fellows Programme, Gale are pleased to support Fellowships undertaking a 3 month period of Digital Humanities research at the University of Oxford using the Centre for Digital Scholarship of the Bodleian Libraries. Information regarding the candidates and their projects are available here. On 2nd May 2019 we hosted the DH Day at the British Library. A diverse and popular line up of speakers representing DH scholarship and academic libraries from around the world, presented the international scope of digital humanities research; how it is being applied to large content sets like newspapers, how it is being taught in the classroom and what the library is doing to support DH within their institutions. You can now download the proceedings papers - or  on the video soundbites below to listen to snippets of the speakers presentations. Seth Cayley, VP Gale Primary Sources introduces our BL Speakers papers in this opening chapter.  The DH day was split into four distinct sessions: (1) Literature & Distant Reading; (2) Computers
Reading the News; (3) Digital Humanities in the Classroom; and (4) Institutional Support and
Infrastructure for digital humanities. Each session was designed to put a spotlight on different
themes in digital humanities, with the first two focusing on the latest research, and the latter two
exploring issues around teaching and the role of the library.
In this volume you will find four of the papers that were presented on that day.

"Reframing Digital Humanities by Julian Chambliss, an OER Text – Laurie N. Taylor, Librarian","Laurie Taylor is the Senior Director for Library Technology & Digital Strategies. She provides leadership for technology and partnerships with the University of Florida Libraries across the university, regionally, nationally, and internationally. She works closely with colleagues to sustain collaborations for building collections, community, and capacity, including for the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) and LibraryPress@UF. Her work is geared towards enabling a culture of radical collaboration that values and supports diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thoughts my own. Julian Chambliss’ awesome Reframing Digital Humanities series 2 podcast is now also an OER text! The full volume is online: https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/reframingdh/ From Chambliss’ “Introduction”: Reframing History was inspired by the idea of providing a public narrative about work rooted in the community and relying on digital practice. Season one of Reframing History documented our efforts to tell that local history story and called my attention to how the challenge of definition around digital humanities, which is understood somewhat within academia, is a worthwhile public scholarship project. Thus, season 2 of Reframing History became a series of conversations with scholars about digital humanities. To create the list of interviewees, I relied on my own digital past and present. As such, I cannot argue that the conversations are encyclopedic or vital actors that might define digital humanities in meaningful ways were not omitted. If you are coming to this project searching for certainty, you will be disappointed. What I can say is, within the confines of the limitations of my knowledge and experience with digital humanities practice, this set of conversations touched on many of the issues I find to be crucial to understanding the values of digital humanities. The conversations in Part I: Visioning Digital Humanities were with Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Rob Nelson, Sharon Leon, and Kathryn Tomasek and they offer through their experience a framing of the hope for the digital to enhance the public’s engagement with the humanities comes into view.  Part II: Identity and Digital Humanities highlights how recovering voices and surfacing patterns in our collective lived experience can be achieved through digital means. Scholars such as Maryemma Graham, Hilary Green, Dhanashree Thorat, and Roopika Risam are doing that work and offer crucial perspectives on the ideas that drive them and the implications for public knowledge. Part III: Cultural Reproduction and Digital Humanities offer a way to think about how that public knowledge equation manifest as scholars utilize the digital to further their work.  Concluding this work with a conversation with the members of CEDAR seems both appropriate and timely. Our discussion about what DH can do continues the process of visioning we are doing. I think we all recognize the impact of the COVID pandemic will be with us for years to come, and the place digital humanities will play in the future needs to be considered carefully. As a transcript derived from a recording, I hope you will recognize that we took pains to try to maintain the integrity of the subject’s words while attempting to make a conversation understood in written form. In the end, I think we managed to accomplish the goal of archiving these meaningful conversations. This is a super fantastic new volume for folks teaching and researching in DH, with accessible chapters representing different interview discussions and projects that speak to the diversity of the field and specific projects and perspectives. I am super excited to see this out, and to see what will build and come from this! Laurie N.

News Bureau | ILLINOIS,"Projects led by Illinois music professor Gabriel Solis and HathiTrust Research Center associate director Glen Worthey will enhance access to archival jazz and digital humanities collections. The projects are collaborative efforts funded through a new grant program by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. Photo of Gabriel Solis by Darrell Hoemann; photo of Glen Worthey by Cindy Brya CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are among the first recipients of new grant funding to advance digital scholarship in cultural institutions, through a joint initiative of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. The first round of NEH/AHRC New Directions for Digital Scholarship in Cultural Institutions grants provides funding to eight teams of international researchers for collaborative projects. The program aims to develop new methods of sharing culture and heritage with global audiences, open new research frontiers and advance collections-based research methods. Gabriel Solis, a music professor and the head of the theatre department, is the project director of “New Directions in Digital Jazz Studies: Music Information Retrieval and AI Support for Jazz Scholarship in Digital Archives,” a collaboration with City, University of London. A team of musicologists, computer scientists and jazz archivists is using artificial intelligence and music information-retrieval tools to enhance access to archival jazz collections, including those held by the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, Newark and the Scottish Jazz Archive. The team will build “smart” search capacities based on music information-retrieval algorithms. Its research will allow for automated transcription and melodic pattern analysis of audio collections in jazz archives, furthering new discoveries in the audio recordings held by archives that have not circulated widely as commercial releases. Linking this audio information to other kinds of archival holdings relating to the music and musicians, such as texts and images, will give the jazz world new tools to further understand the music’s rich history, Solis said. Glen Worthey, the associate director for research support services at the HathiTrust Research Center, is the project director of “AEOLIAN (Artificial intelligence for cultural organizations),” a collaboration with Loughborough University in the U.K. The project will bring together a team of experts to develop and examine new approaches – particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning – for improving access to and use of digital collections that are currently restricted due to privacy concerns or copyright protection. The objectives are to make the digital collections more accessible; to analyze them using innovative AI research methods; and to identify potential collaborations between U.S. and U.K. cultural organizations, Worthey said. The research team will organize six online workshops over two years; grow the international network of scholars working with digital archives; and produce a major interdisciplinary report on the uses of AI at cultural institutions, along with a series of agenda-setting scholarly publications, Worthey said. The collaborative effort is being led by the HathiTrust Research Center, which is co-hosted by the School of Information Sciences. It involves partnerships with several U.S. and U.K. universities and libraries, and digital humanities research scholars.

Why is most of the 20th Century invisible to AI? - CILIP: the library and information association,"Risk aversion is the issue that Professor Melissa Terras returns to again and again when she talks about copyright. She says that circumstances – financial, political and cultural – mean institutions increasingly resort to a blanket ‘no’
                    when asked to take any copyright risk. As a data scientist and information engineer – rather than a professional librarian – is she just impatient with the sector’s tried and tested safety mechanisms? This could be answered by pointing out that she is CILIP chartered (she discovered
                    her own personal attitude to risk on a Naomi Korn copyright course), is a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, has taught library students at UCL, and chairs the Library & Information Systems Committee for Arts, Humanities
                    and Social Sciences, responsible for spending on library materials and systems across a third of the University of Edinburgh. But even if she didn’t have these credentials, her observations about the bizarre impact of copyright on
                    research should prompt institutions to reassess their attitude to copyright risk. “I think the blanket ‘no’ should be replaced by risk assessment” she says, “because this should be about institutions understanding their capacity for risk. They should ask “what’s the worst thing that can happen?” I’ve read that only
                    seven libraries have been taken to court in the UK. And if they’re more worried about reputational risk than the benefit they might bring to their audience, there is a problem. Because is it really copyright – the right of the author
                    – that you’re worried about?” “Being on the boards of certain places, I can see that institutions are inherently risk averse. They don’t want any bad press, they don’t want to use institutional resources paying for lawyers, they don’t even want that conversation. So,
                    while the tension should be ‘yes there is copyright, and yes we should be respectful of creators’, that is not where we are now, we are in a state of paralysis.” However, Melissa acknowledges that, right now, cultural institutions face a perfect storm: “The political and financial threats our institutions face are real. They are not just a perceived threat – it’s a very dangerous time to speak
                    up and rock the boat when you don’t even know if you’re going to have an operational budget next year.” The problem isn’t just a sector on the backfoot. As chair of a university library committee, she has followed the current ebook pricing controversy and believes it is a symptom of a deeper problem. “They’re fleecing us. I understand there’s
                    a commercial opportunity, but this is during a pandemic. So, I think part of the problem is the way that commercial suppliers view universities as cash cows. Ebook pricing is symptomatic of many things that are wrong with the way the
                    information environment works around universities and research. How, in a world where we are all working from home, can the information environment be so locked down? It is the fear of copyright and the licences which are entered into
                    with the major suppliers. This is not just a research issue. It is a point of social justice. If you go to a rich university, you will have access to information that you can’t get at your local college.” But it is in her own areas of expertise that she can describe the tangible impact of copyright restrictions and the fear around them. In an era when computers are learning to measure the influence of culture, copyright keeps the 20th and
                    21st Century off limits. Melissa’s career path started off firmly in the arts. A revelation came when she was asked to present her undergraduate dissertation (on ancient Greek art) in a multimedia project. “That’s when I saw I should be doing computing. Before
                    that I was a bit lost. People were saying it wasn’t an area of academic study – that computing in arts and humanities wasn’t a real thing. But I saw that it was, like a truth of the universe.” She turned this realisation into a reality, converting to a masters in computing science, followed by a PhD in engineering at Oxford. “At Oxford I was working in a group that did image processing – extracting information from digital images.
                    It’s very common now, with face and handwriting recognition. We were applying techniques used to interpret medical images to ancient documents, using them to read things that were too damaged for the human eye. A computer can take
                    each mark and say ‘this is likely to be a handwriting stroke’ or “this is likely to be wood grain” or “this is likely to be noise because it was buried for 2,000 years”. You pull out all the scratches and then run probability engines
                    over what is left, like a crossword puzzle. The big one we did that the historians were really excited about was a document proving that the Roman Army had road tax in northern Britain.” To read Roman artefacts computers needed a to be trained on a digital library of handwriting to see if a mark was part of a message or noise. Now, among the things that Melissa and her students use computational techniques for, is the
                    investigation of individuals rather than artefacts – to see how they have been influenced by culture. Instead of a library of marks, a conventional library of books – digitised in full – is needed and can provide insights that were
                    impossible in a pre-digital era. “I had a PhD student called Dr Helen O’Neill and she worked with the London Library, looking at their members’ books and registers. We looked at John Stuart Mill, the politician and economist, who was
                    an active member and donated a number of books. Helen compiled a list of all the books he’d borrowed from and donated to the library, and then we used large scale computing to mine that against all the books he’d ever written. It was
                    like a historical Turnitin (a web-based plagiarism checker). It meant you could find the influence of a library on an individual through his books. But to do this you need to have those lists of books and then it’s all contingent on
                    having access to the full text of these books. At the moment you can only do that on pre-copyright years. The guillotine falls about 1910. You can’t study anyone after 1910 using that because we can’t get access to full text resources,
                    unless you digitise them all yourself. The Victorians are the people that you can study because that’s when you first have mass print that’s all out of copyright. You can’t do it on the Edwardians, you can’t do it on the second world
                    war. No way can you touch the 1940s. So, we couldn’t easily do that same study on Virginia Woolf (as some of her works are still under copyright in the UK, and so not available for text mining, unless we digitise them ourselves). One of Melissa’s recent projects used text mining to find mentions of professors and academics in children’s literature. It provides a good illustration of the problem. “I have a nice graph which is about the number of professors in children’s
                    books and from about 1850 it rises and rises because I’m able to do full text searches across Google books and the Internet Archive until you hit about 1910. Then it disappears because you can’t search in the same way. Your method has to change from doing full text searches across ­massive collections to actually doing a traditional bibliographic search, calling things up from the library and looking through yourself, and that limits scale to human.
                    It picks up again in 2010 because of Waterstone’s catalogue, ebay and ­Amazon. A similar issue would crop up if she attempted her current project in the 20th Century. The book will publish primary sources about women’s rights like
                    speeches. Here the text mining is used to hunt down references. “You take a speech from a Tuesday in February in 1890 and the speaker is talking about what a politician said last week – no name just ‘the honorable gentleman said...’ and the audience laugh. It’s like someone saying “Barnard Castle”
                    now. “In a hundred years you’ll go ‘what’s that?’ Without these resources, this mass digitised content to mine against, I would be lost. But you can only do this against large-scale digitised content, which is bounded by the copyright
                    frameworks.”
                 Melissa acknowledges the problem is not a simple one to solve. “I’m not saying for a minute we should ride roughshod over creators’ incomes. Similarly I don’t agree with those researchers and academics who think because something is out
                    of copyright they have a right to see it for free. “They need to be more respectful of libraries for looking after stuff for hundreds of years. I have dug up things where I’m probably the first person to see it for a 100 years. It doesn’t bother me that I have to pay a fee for that to
                    be digitised. The point is that I wouldn’t be able to find it without the stewardship of this library.” She wonders if institutions might benefit more from opening up and trusting people’s good will. “What you get in libraries, for example in the BL reading room, are signs saying ‘you can take pictures for your own studies but it’s illegal
                    to use them anywhere else’, perhaps they could say ‘if you are taking our out-of-copyright stuff and using it elsewhere you might want to contribute back to this institution…’.” She also acknowledges the organisations on the further reaches of the sector and suggests more support for them when they push boundaries that most cannot touch. “I love the Internet Archive and not just that they are pushing the envelope when it comes to copyright and permission and their cheekiness. They’ve built an incredible infrastructure that is amazing for researchers and I don’t think that
                    they get enough kudos. With their Emergency Library the voice of the publishers against them is very strong and we don’t have that same lobbying for researchers. But they’ve done some really interesting things, and have a completely
                    different attitude. I donate to the Internet Archive and to Wikipedia (and more people that use them should), or if I use an image or content from a library I make sure I make a donation. However, I realise this is a point of privilege,
                    that I have the resources to do so.” This all shows how aspects of copyright intersect with aspects of privilege, and how choices made regarding what is prioritised to be in the digitised environment is dependent on risk appetites,
                    affecting access for all. Melissa is still optimistic, though, about the potential of using digital approaches to study the past. “We’re only just getting started. And there’s so much more we – and the students and researchers coming
                    after us – will be able to do, given the digital cultural information environment is ever growing, as are the tools available to interrogate it.”                   News In depth Interview Insight       Benefits of CILIP membership",https://www.cilip.org.uk/news/557160/Why-is-most-of-the-20th-Century-invisible-to-AI.htm

Adding a Digital Humanities bit to the OA book funding landscape: DARIAH is launching an annual OA monograph bursary for Early Career Researchers in Digital Humanities – Open Access Books Network,"Open Access Books Network A place to discuss Open Access books  This post, written by Dr. Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra, the Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU is an introduction to the next event in the ‘BoOkmArks: Open Conversations About OA Books’ series. A live session, open to all, will be held via this Zoom link on Tuesday 23rd March at 16:00 CET/ 15:00 GMT/11:00 ET, when we will interview Erzsébet about the DARIAH bursary for OA monographs for ECRs in Digital Humanities. If you have questions for Erzsébet, please add them to the comments section below so they can be included in the conversation on 23rd March — and join us at the event if you can! A recording will be available afterwards via our YouTube channel. “I went to a ‘publishing in the humanities’ day and the panel of academics were very keen on saying that they didn’t rely on impact factors but no one could answer a PhD student in the audience who wanted to know how you knew where to publish apart from ‘you just find out’.” (Em Nunn 2019, tweet) Exploring and supporting pathways to the open research culture for Arts and Humanities scholars is among the strategic commitments of DARIAH, and therefore we do our best to sufficiently address questions like the one above, and find solutions that fit best the specific circumstances of those who ask them. One of the most complex and most challenging scenarios that we regularly encounter in our open research and Open Access advocacy practice is finding pathways for publishing one’s first monograph Open Access. One source of difficulties is that in the current European OA funding landscape, we see a big gap that disproportionately and seriously affects those who wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. Although there is an increasing support from science funders to extend their OA mandates to books, and to cover the costs of Book Publishing Charges as parts of research grants, first monographs typically come from PhD dissertations, not externally funded research projects. Likewise, even though some of the research institutions have transformative agreements and/or institutional Open Access funds in place, these are not always available for non-permanent (or non-tenured) faculty members and even if so, they usually do not cover the whole publication charges (BPCs) of a monograph published in the book series that is topically the most relevant to Early Career Researchers (ECRs). Early Career Researchers under double pressure This gap in the OA funding structures is not the only difficulty ECRs are facing when they wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. A well-known and frequently voiced challenge is that due to the very strong influence of the  prestige economy on the current academic tenure and promotion criteria, in most cases, young scholars still need to choose between their academic career prospects vs. publishing in fair Open Access venues (and all the societal, economic and scholarly benefits that come with it). Therefore, it is clear that in parallel to our ongoing efforts and commitments of different kinds to change this situation for the better and enable the full transition of scholarly communication to responsible and community-driven means of Open Access on a systemic level,  we also need to provide immediate help to ECRs to enable them to start from a strong position in terms of formal assessment but also to practice their ethical devotion and establish themselves as scholars who significantly contribute  to the fair and open research culture. The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond.  The planned bursary is a very small step to this direction as we are planning to fund one monograph per year but hopefully in the future, other actors will be willing to form a coalition to support the initiative and make it bigger.  Small but immediate help with safeguards for fair Open Access To help scholars balance these conflicting expectations, we also need to strive for a balance between giving them freedom to publish their work OA at a venue of their choice based on topical relevance (e.g. in the book series their work would most naturally belong)  vs. preventing the DARIAH OA monograph fund from feeding profits of big, commercial players. To achieve this. Opening the discourse and coordinating with allies It is important to highlight that DARIAH’s efforts to help optimizing Open Access publishing to Arts and Humanities scholars’ needs are not becoming realized in an isolated space but instead, are embedded in a support network where sister infrastructures like OPERAS and actors from different sectors are joining forces and coordinate to make the most from both their individual and collective contributions to the responsible and open scholarly communication in the Social Science and Humanities. In a dedicated OA Books Network meeting, we would be honoured to lend the rich expertise of the OABN network and open up a consultation about specific details of the bursary to make sure that we do it right. In the broader context of challenges around publishing first monographs OA we wish to discuss: Implementation plan and the eligibility criteria of the funding program is expected to be published with the official call, to be launched in early April 2021.

Introduction to Digital Humanities is designed for researchers, teachers, and learners in humanities subject areas who wish to align their work with the field of digital humanities. Many institutions are encouraging digital approaches to the humanities, and this book offers guidance for students and scholars wishing to make that move by reflecting on why and when digital humanities tools might usefully be applied to engage in the kind of inquiry that is the basis for study in humanities disciplines. In other words, this book puts the ""humanities"" before the ""digital"" and offers the reader a conceptual framework for how digital projects can advance research and study in the humanities. Both established and early career humanities scholars who wish to embrace digital possibilities in their research and teaching will find insights on current approaches to the digital humanities, as well as helpful studies of successful projects.

Digital Humanities | Department of English | Nebraska,"in the Department of English Craig Chandler | University Communications The Department of English is an exciting place to study digital humanities. Our approach is shaped by the department’s commitment to imaginative reasoning, blending cutting-edge classroom-based instruction with experiential learning opportunities for students of all levels. Imaginative reasoning helps us “re-frame how we look at the world” in a critical way. We are also engaged in the department’s focus on social justice and anti-racist action, studying questions of race, gender, sexuality, and economics in our classrooms and research projects. Digital approaches to literature reframe the way we have traditionally seen, understood, analyzed, published, and preserved our cultural heritage. Scholarship in digital humanities, for example, tends to be collaborative rather than solitary in nature. The team-oriented approach means that questions larger than any one person could undertake can be addressed. And because many projects are web-based, the public is invited into the creation or reconsideration of cultural knowledge through our scholarly efforts. The Department is home to a range of cutting-edge digital work. Students in our department are immersed in digital archive building, computational text analysis, and textual scholarship to explore questions central to the study of literature across history and continents. Our composition and rhetoric faculty have expertise in digital writing environments and digital rhetoric. And our close relationship with the internationally recognized Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) allows students to engage in exciting Center-sponsored activities and to get a first-hand experience of complex digital humanities project development. We encourage you to jump into an exciting world where code grapples with art and faculty and students work together to create digital archives out of the materials of poets, scholars, journalists, explorers, and novelists. For more on DH in the Department of English, contact the current department DH coordinator, Stephen Ramsay, at sramsay2@unl.edu. Ph.D. 2020, UNL EnglishUS Latino Digital Humanities Post Doctoral Fellow, University of Houston “DH technology-based courses have given me opportunities to learn and apply text analysis and interpretation applications. Collaborative courses have provided project development and management opportunities to developing project proposals and work with the non profit community to create sustainable products and processes. “As a 2017 Digital Scholar Incubator (DSI) Fellow, I was able to craft an Omeka collection site and a Scalar multi-media site for the case study I am using for my dissertation. The time as a DSI, along with the exercises in ideation critical to the creative process, created a unique combination of time and space for intense interpretive experimentation and critique, now reflected in the rich and varied narrative of final Scalar site production. “Finally, I am a multi-modal scholar and teacher because I have implemented much of the technology and collaborative processes I learned through my DH courses. I integrate organic pedagogy with available technologies to provide my composition and rhetoric students a platform of new and exciting ways to explore and articulate complex ideas and texts. The methodologies DH offers continues to shorten the distance between the ways I can successfully construct and explore narrative ideas in the classroom and in my own scholarship.” Ph.D. Student, Department of English Claire Jiménez is a Puerto Rican writer who grew up in Brooklyn and Staten Island, New York. She is the author of Staten Island Stories (Johns Hopkins University Press), which received a NYC Book Award from the New York Society Library and was a finalist for the International Latino Book Awards. Jiménez is a PhD student in English, pursuing certificates in ethnic studies and digital humanities at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where she is also an assistant fiction editor for Prairie Schooner. She is a graduate of the MFA program in Fiction at Vanderbilt University.  In 2020, she received a Mellon Foundation grant from the U.S Latino Digital Humanities Program at the University of Houston to work with a team of scholars to develop a digital archive of Puerto Rican literature that she had begun as a Summer fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. With the help of USLDH, this project was later awarded the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Presidential Initiatives Grant, for which Jiménez is a Co-Principal Investigator. Her fiction, essays, and reviews have appeared in Remezcla, Afro-Hispanic Review, PANK, The Rumpus, el roommate, and Eater, among other publications. In our DH classrooms and in collaborative project settings, students can study a vast range of subjects: from the most innovative DH theories and technologies such as spectral imaging and text analysis to the nuts and bolts of grant writing and site development.

Our students pursue digital projects and careers equipped with an understanding of how their work shapes culture. Our digital humanities students aren't just doing projects—they're inventing them and leading them. We are helping Nebraska's students bring creativity to code, so that they can be innovators in an ever-shifting electronic world. Digital humanities faculty and students in the Department of English work closely with the university's distinguished Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH). Without the staff and resources of the Center, which is a joint initiative of the University Libraries and the College of Arts & Sciences, most of the Department of English projects listed above would not have been possible. The Center works with scholars and departments across the university, sponsors various activities related to digital humanities practice, and offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to hone their technical skills while taking part in cutting edge digital humanities research. For more on the Center, contact its co-directors Andrew Jewell at ajewell2@unl.edu and Kenneth Price at kprice2@unl.edu. The Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is an annual thematic exploration of issues in Digital Humanities. Sponsored by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and bringing speakers from institutions around the world, the Forum has been organized around topics like Social Justice and Cultural Memory, Video Games and the Humanities, and Digital Cultural Heritage. We offer students the opportunity to study the type of writing that underlies nearly all new media forms: namely, programming. The Graduate Certificate Program in Digital Humanities allows graduate and post-baccalaureate students to gain scholarly credentials in Digital Humanities. Work in this area can take a variety of forms, including: digital scholarly editing; the creation of thematic research archives and resources; programmatic analysis of large-scale textual corpora; the use of geo-spatial tools and technologies to study the interaction of people and place; data mining and machine learning techniques using historical data; 3D modeling of historical buildings and artifacts; tool building and software development for humanities research; and the creation of games, interactive environments, and media systems with a humanistic focus. Learn More Undergraduate English majors design their own concentration - a program of study based on their areas of interest, organized around a controlling theme or topic. Majors can design a concentration in digital humanities by meeting with their advisor. Learn More The minor in digital humanities offers a wide range of courses that allow students to explore how digital technologies alter our understanding of ourselves, our art, our history, and our culture. Students learn how to critically engage with digital media, and many courses introduce students to digital techniques for research, analysis, and publication. Each student gains experience with hands-on, creative digital work, and several courses provide students opportunities to conceive and build digital projects independently and with teams of other students. The range of electives available for the digital humanities minor, combined with frequent special topics courses that can easily be substituted in, means that students can find distinctive groups of courses that speak to their interests in literature, history, archeology, classics, art history, 3D modeling, text analysis, digital archives, and more. Graduates with a digital humanities minor are well prepared for a growing number of careers in industry, nonprofit, and educational sectors that welcome digital skills alongside the communication and critical thinking abilities that have long been valued in humanities students. Students have also gone on to pursue graduate work in the humanities, library science, and information science, among other disciplines. Learn More The students I work with on the Whitman Archive have reshaped our understanding of a cultural icon. I’m proud of their achievements—including new discoveries, published articles, NEH grants, and both alt-ac jobs and tenure-line professorships. Brett Barney is a research associate professor in the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and has been involved in the creation and maintenance of the Walt Whitman Archive since 2000. He served two terms on the technical council of the Text Encoding Initiative and is especially interested in encoding protocols that support the creation of documentary editions and the identification of various, complex relationships among documents and parts of documents. Matt Cohen is a contributing editor at the Walt Whitman Archive, where his projects include digitizing Whitman’s marginal annotations, building a visualizable handlist of reprints of Whitman’s poetry, and improving access to translations of Whitman’s work. That work informed his book Whitman’s Drift: Imagining Literary Distribution (University of Iowa Press, 2017). He is also a co-editor of the Charles W. Chesnutt Archive. Editor and writer Kwame Dawes is the editor of Prairie Schooner and the founder and director of the African Poetry Book Fund, the home of the African Poetry Digital Portal and several African poetry book series. Dawes’s scholarship is in post-colonial studies, African literature, Caribbean literature, and African American Literature. He won an Emmy for new approaches to news and documentary programming for LiveHopeLove.com, and has received grants from the Ford Foundation and the Mellon Foundation for digital humanities projects. Amanda Gailey’s research and teaching interests include nineteenth-century American literature, digital editing, and the sociopolitical implications of technology.  Andy Jewell is the director of the Willa Cather Archive, a large online archive and publisher of digital resources relating to the American author (like the Complete Letters of Willa Cather, debuting in January 2018).

Basics of Mapping for the Digital Humanities – IDRE Sandbox,"http://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/basics-of-mapping-for-the-digital-humanities In the Humanities, mapping can be defined in so many different ways, there is no easy answer to these questions. In fact, your research can dictate the parameter of choices that define your map. Below are a few examples of just how multi-faceted mapping can be for the humanities, and how the digital can help scope and develop innovative approaches to projects. How then might your project utilize these tools? “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” -Waldo Tobler Waldo Tobler’s statement defines his first law of geography, in ways stating the obvious correlation between objects in space, paving the foundation behind spatial dependencies. Equally important, we may argue, is that the same dependencies that exist in space also exist in time. Chronology is a representation of sequential data as spatial overlays, often visualized to show relationships, dependencies, and causation through time. As mentioned at the top of the syllabus for this course, space and time are dimensions that are forever intertwined due to their ontological nature. So far, we have mastered the skills necessary to put objects onto an interactive map, but how then, can we combine the temporal dimension into our visual representation of our subject matter? More importantly, is temporality not the single most important component to complete our spatial narrative? The representation of 3 dimensional space onto a flat, 2 dimensional platform–a map–brings with it many challenges and compromises (e.g. projection systems). Every “flat” map in existence compromises on one geographical element: Shape, Area, Distance or Direction. So too, does the representation of the “fourth dimension”, or time, bring about much to contemplate on how best to summarize and eventually effectively visualize geo-temporal data. Historically, inventive methods employed in visualizing change over time has produced infamous graphics such as Minard’s map of Napoleon’s Russian Campaign in 1812.  Equally inventive and in ways revolutionary to the modern day digital world was the wizardry employed by the exuberant “Jedi Master of data visualization”, Hans Rosling. His legendary TED talk in 2006 was premised by a tool he created called Gapminder, later to be bought out by Google in 2007. As a data visualization tool, Gapminder cleverly incorporates temporal global data on a 2D bubble chart, utilizing choreographed animation sequences to depict change over time. Spatiality is defined by a bubble-per-country, and via the colors of the bubbles, each swath representing a geographic region. Yet, what makes this representation of information compelling is not just in its ability to animate data over time, but more so in its ability to interact with time, pausing, rewinding, forwarding, slowing down and speeding up.   I turn off Google Maps and start to drive. I wonder: what would it mean to drive downward, into the buried pasts that persist somewhere—in the imagination, in the archive, in the memories of others, in the traces of places long gone and lost? Who used to live here? What used to be there? What’s buried under this freeway, under this skyscraper, beneath these overpasses? What has vanished imperceptibly from the surface of the earth? What voices and ghosts haunt, however imperceptibly, these concrete landscapes? Why do I care? It’s a past which is, ostensibly, not my own. I don’t recognize it. It’s not mine. Time is out of joint. – Todd Presner (HyperCities, Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities) Perhaps one of the most innovative geotemporal platforms born and created within academia is HyperCities, the brainchild of our very own Todd Presner. In his words, here is how Todd describes the Hypercities platform: Built on the idea that every past is a place, HyperCities came to life as a digital research and educational platform for exploring, learning about, and interacting with the layered histories of city and global spaces. Developed though collaboration between UCLA, USC, CUNY, and numerous community- based organizations, the fundamental idea behind HyperCities is that all histories “take place” somewhere and sometime, and that they become more meaningful when they interact and intersect with other histories. Through the Google Maps and Earth APIs, HyperCities essentially allows users to go back in time to create, narrate, and explore the historical layers of city spaces and tell stories in an interactive, hypermedia environment. The idea that we can spiral downwards–or upwards–from any location to navigate into the past or future is at the core of the HyperCities platform, to the degree that technology can allow such a concept to manifest. The obvious choice to represent time via a web-based interface is to provide some sort of time dial, a time-machine of sorts that allows you to punch in a past (or future) date, and navigate to that time to present information relevant to that temporal space. Web-based time representations are made possible via a myriad of functional visual widgets. Most popular are the time sliders that allow users to navigate into the past by “sliding” a set of handles to go back (or forward) in time. Google Earth uses such a slider effectively to navigate time:  The advantage of dynamic time sliders is that they are malleable, they adjust to the time spans dictated by the content material. In the screen shot from Google Earth, the time slider itself is indicative of the content being provided, in this case, we can depict that this particular location has historical satellite image dating back to 1992. In the open source community, various temporal widgets have surfaced, none more prominent than the SIMILE Timeline Widget. Funded by the Mellon Foundation in 2003, Simile was a joint research project run by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and MIT CSAIL. Despite the fact that the project ended in 2008, the tool remains available and popular today–via open source channels–a testament to the longevity of well documented, interoperable and functional open source platforms. It also speaks to the difficulty of building time-based visualization platforms. The LA Times uses the SIMILE timeline to effectively show crime over time. Temporal platforms seemingly entered a lull after SIMILE, signaling an end of an era for innovations in time-based visualizations. Several notable libraries have emerged, most notably Timeline JS, produced by Northwestern Univesity’s Knight Lab, which capitalizes on the increased usage of cloud technologies by academics and journalists alike. Timeline JS capitulates on the popularity of Google Docs, cleverly utilizing the Spreadsheet API to link data directly into its visually appealing timeline, allowing one to manipulate data dynamically, effectively utilizing it as a database driving the web interface. However, its dependency on Google, coupled with the timeline’s inability to scale time beyond a single day.  Perhaps signaling a new wave of geotemporal platforms, CartoDB emerged onto the scene in 2012, when it’s platform was launched at the Where 2.0 conference. Unlike other emerging online mapping platforms such as Leaflet and Mapbox, CartoDB prides itself in its database driven mapping approach, built on an open source backend of PostGIS and PostGRESQL.  It may come as a surprise to conclude this segment on temporal visualization platforms with a little-known open source project called vis.js. While more prominent libraries such as D3 and Palladio have stolen the limelight in recent years, vis.js delivers as an all-encompassing, dynamic, visualization library. More intriguing is that unlike similar libraries that are born within academia, vis.js was created by an R&D team from a Dutch company Almende, whose mission is “to empower human beings to better organize their lives in an increasingly complex world”. Similar to the Simile project, vis.js offers several libraries for different visualization techniques. Their Timeline library offers to create “fully customizable, interactive timeline with items and ranges”. Perhaps the beauty lies in its lack of any spectacular looking interfaces. Rather, it focuses almost singularly on function… function that allows you to navigate through time–from milliseconds to decades–in a matter of yes, seconds. [full screen] Further, its claim as a “fully customizable” tool is justified by the ease of which in incorporates JSON data, allowing the timeline to co-exist with other visual components, such as maps. Now that you have a better understanding of the spatial and temporal components of a map, you may wonder how can I extract locations from my data? One way to do so is to use Google Fusion tables on data fields such as “Address” or “City Name”. First go to https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?dsrcid=implicit and import your CSV table (Sample Coin Data Set here):  Then click on next, after choosing your header row. To start the geocoding, go to “File” then “Geocode”: Finally, choose the field with your location data, it can be either city name, latitude/longitude, addresses, etc.  The geocoder will attempt to match the field to a coordinate then you can click on “Map” to view your results.  You can tell the Google Fusion Table to treat any field as a “Location” by clicking on the arrow next to the field header and clicking “Change”:  In this case we are going to make “NAT” (which is Nation) the location:  Now you can geocode it:  And there you have it!

#DayOfDH2020 at Brock University’s Centre for Digital Humanities | by Aaron Mauro | Medium,"Apr 29, 2020 Brock University is a public research institution in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. It sits perched atop the beautiful Niagara Escarpment overlooking the rocky shores of Lake Ontario. This bucolic setting is perfect for growing grapes and great digital humanities (DH) programs! Brock University has had a Centre for Digital Humanities since 2002! During that time, the CDH has always worked at the exciting intersection of interactive technologies and the humanities! For our Day of DH2020 blog post, we’d like to capture just a small glimpse of the work that our faculty, staff, and students do every day. Jason Hawreliak and Aaron Mauro will take turns describing our work and how it fits into the CDH. The surprising and wonderful thing about DH is how it takes on a local flavour wherever it is practiced. The local culture of Digital Humanities in the CDH has placed a strong emphasis on interactive media, including video games, data visualization, application development, and many others. It is a distinct brand of DH that is heavily influenced by the spirit and ethos of game development culture. The CDH at Brock is housed within Faculty of Humanities and is both a research and teaching centre. If pressed to summarize the culture of the CDH, we’d have to say that collaboration is part of everything we do. We host two academic programs, the Interactive Arts and Science and Game Design programs, both of which are generously supported through inter-departmental, inter-faulty, and even inter-institutional collaborations. Interactive Arts and Science enjoys great support from faculty across the Faculty of Humanities as well as from Brock’s own Computer Science program, within the Faculty of Mathematics and Science. Similarly, the Game program benefits from a great partnership with Niagara College Canada, which means our students receive both a college and university diploma. This deep collaboration between our neighbouring institutions allows our students to benefit from the superb, technically intensive, training of a college environment and the broader questions and critical training of a humanities degree. Our students are developers and storytellers. They are critics and makers. They are burgeoning creative professionals who are interested in questions of community and collaboration, but they are also having a blast while they do it! Our labs are expertly equipped to both develop and test games. Playtesting is a critical part of the development cycle, but it is also just a lot of fun. In some ways, playtesting is the moment when the critical and technical come together most. Students are trying to break things. They see where the failures are in the code and try to make them better. On that note, we’ll shift away from our “royal we” and give the stage to Jason so he can explain how games and DH work together! Hi, I’m Jason, and I’m the director at the CDH! Although I’m the director of a Centre for Digital Humanities, as a games researcher I have to admit I’ve never quite felt like a digital humanist. No one has ever said to me that games don’t belong in DH, but when most people think of DH (if they think of it at all!) game studies is probably not what they have in mind. When I’ve attended DH conferences or read DH articles, games are present, but usually as what seems like an aside. And when they are mentioned, it’s usually in the context of serious games, game-based learning, or gamification. My colleagues in the CDH, Alex Christie and Aaron Mauro, are digital humanists. They use digital technologies to engage with questions in the Humanities, such as textual interpretation and epistemology. It’s fantastic work and I marvel at it. Me, on the other hand? I study how videogames communicate meaning, primarily through the frameworks of semiotics and rhetoric. I’m interested in how games contribute to a wider rhetorical ecosystem that reinforces and contests worldviews, social norms, and ideologies. I more or less use the analytical tools I learned in my English Language and Literature degrees and apply them to interactive media. That feels decidedly less DH-y somehow. Part of the issue might be that I’m not much of a games practitioner. I do make small games occasionally, but mostly as a way to either a) maintain a conversational knowledge of development practices (which help me better understand my object of study), or b) teach introductory modules on game design to undergraduate students. In other words, making games is a complement to my research, but certainly not integral to it. Right or wrong, DH has always had the air of production to me; making is a necessary part of knowing (“less yack, more hack”), and that’s much less prominent in game studies (Elizabeth Losh has a fantastic article which deals with some of these issues in greater detail). My favorite definitions of DH are some version of “using digital technologies to study questions in the Humanities, and using Humanities frameworks to study digital technologies.” If we accept those, then game studies definitely counts! For the past few years my area of focus has been on multimodal communication, namely, how semiotic modes like text, image, music, and procedurality (systems) come together in games to convey potential meanings. More recently, I’ve narrowed in on the mode of olfaction and its potential applications in game design and research. How might the game equivalent of smell-o-vision be used in games? Products like the FeelReal VR accessory already exist, and researchers have been studying olfaction in games for a while. But I’m interested in olfaction as part of a broader multimodal “ensemble” in games. How might scents be used in conjunction with images and sounds to create compelling experiences? Or perhaps more importantly, how might scents be used to make games more accessible? Olfactory games aren’t likely to become mainstream hits, but at the very least this avenue of study forces us to think beyond the predominantly visual and auditory modes of communication in games. Hi everyone, I’m Aaron. I’m new to the CDH, and I’ve found fast friends and colleagues here. Since arriving at Brock and finding myself in a new DH culture, I’ve found myself translating the dialects of DH that I’ve known in the past to this wonderfully vibrant, game centred community that embraces interactive media so completely. I feel a little like this classic old promo video for Microsoft SQL servers. In this odd little piece of computing history, Bill Gates and Ed Esber demonstrate different front end applications for accessing “the same data” from the same SQL server. Warning: I’m going to stretch this metaphor, so stay with me. Jason and I are accessing the same DH using different front end methodologies, but our underlying approach to DH (this part is the server metaphor bit) is the same. “It’s the same DH!” Okay, so maybe I took it too far, but I like to think this dorky video says something about how a simple database can help describe our research. On a very fundamental level, we are thinking about our human relationships through technology. My research has two dominant areas at present, which I see has being intimately linked. With that said, I’m also making comparisons between SQL databases and research methodologies, so maybe I see tangential connections more than most. I am working on a monograph called Cybersecurity and the Humanities, which is a cyberpunk infused romp through all the cybersecurity issues facing us in the 21st century. I’m taking lessons learned from speculative fiction about technology and thinking about how the humanities can inform cybersecurity practices and policy. I’m also thinking about how cybersecurity best practices might offer humanists a new framework for thinking about issues relating to justice, equality, and democracy. The other half of my work has to do with data visualization and natural language processing or NLP. I use NLP techniques every day in developing different penetration tests or social engineering experiments, so I like to think these two halves of my DH practice align easily. Anyway, I’m working to explore the complete print run of the Encyclopedia Britannica using NLP methods. The corpus represents some 15 editions, across 244 years of print history. There have been the typical trials and tribulations with OCR. There have been issues with access to original materials, some of which we scanned by hand! Despite these problems and the time they take to correct, the project has gone remarkably smoothly because of the maturity of the Python data science technology stack, which includes great graphing, machine learning, and distributed computation tooling. I’ve collected the current project findings on this site, and I’ll be making updates shortly. By far, the biggest problem I’ve faced has been visualizing such a large, nuanced data set. I’ve wanted to explore complex relationships between the evolution of terms and “ideas” across all 244 years. I wanted to see the evolution of concepts from the height of the European Enlightenment until the 21st century. I wanted to understand how pernicious and damaging ideas became something like general knowledge. How have questions of race, gender, and class been codified as something generally known to be true? How could damaging and regressive ideas evolve into a state of “givenness” that generations of readers would accept these ideas as unquestionably true? In order to show these complex relationships, I turned to Blender to develop 3D visualizations. These 3D visualizations allow me to “fly” through the data and explore the original content of the each node. Because Blender has a fantastic Python API, it can be linked up with all my great Python data science tools! This system is already giving new insights that would not have been possible using standard visualization libraries. The next step will be to render these visualizations in a VR/AR headset and allow the user a fully immersive experience. The goal with this work is to make these complex visualizations interactive and intuitive. I want to explore data. I want to allow for an experiential quality for data analysis that allows for intuition and aesthetics to factor into making observations and making new discoveries! I want to bring the human sense of awe and wonder into data visualization! And we’re back! We had a lot of fun sharing some of our work on Day of DH 2020! With just two examples, we hope we’ve shown how two very different approaches to DH can be united through interactive media. Interactive media represents an experiential relationship with technology that does not minimize or reduce human creative and critical capacities. Games ask us to play; we test and probe a game to bend and break rules; games ask us to be creative in solving problems and telling stories. The human desire to explore and test the limits of technology seems to be a critical focus for those of us working within the Centre for Digital Humanities at Brock University.

Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities – punctum books,"Earth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2021. 512 pages, illus. ISBN-13: 978-1-953035-57-8. DOI: 10.53288/0274.1.00. OPEN-ACCESS e-book and $27.00 in print: paperbound/5 X 8 in.

Schlund-Vials, Siobhan Senier, Ravynn K. Stringfield Published: 06/24/2021 In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes that by examining the process of history we can “discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.” Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities examines the process of history in the narrative of the digital humanities and deconstructs its history as a straight line from the beginnings of humanities computing. By discussing alternatives histories of the digital humanities that address queer gaming, feminist game studies praxis, Cold War military-industrial complex computation, the creation of the environmental humanities, monolingual discontent in DH, the hidden history of DH in English studies, radical media praxis, cultural studies and DH, indigenous futurities, Pacific Rim postcolonial DH, the issue of scale and DH, the radical, indigenous, feminist histories of the digital database, and the possibilities for an antifascist DH, this collection hopes to re-set discussions of the straight, white origin myths of DH. Thus, this collection hopes to reexamine the silences in such a straight and white masculinist history and delineates how power comes into play to shape this straight, white DH narrative. A number of the pieces in this volume go back to the origin myth of the digital humanities to reassess the hagiography of Father Busa by reconsidering and recontextualizing his legacy and his work in relation to media archaeology, politics, Cold War maneuvers, mechanized genocide, the Third Reich, and the military-industrial complex as it has organized various fields, including Asian Studies. This reassessment of comparative genealogies — vis-à-vis Foucault — undergirds an alternative history of the Jesuit hagiography we have so far been unwilling to reexamine for its narrative use in embellishing an origin hagiography/historiography for digital humanities. Other pieces intertwine the digital humanities with other fields — area studies, Asian American Studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and environmental studies — in order to reexamine how the intersections and juxtapositions reveal silences in these histories. And finally, a number of pieces considers alternative praxes in rethinking these histories, whether it is an essay that is a game or a reevaluation of feminist media praxis.

Eric Hobsbawm's work spanned everything from jazz to the history of banditry, in thousands of texts he wrote in several languages. A new project has brought together his writings in a searchable database — offering readers a goldmine of work by Britain's greatest Marxist historian.

Subscribe at a special rate and don’t miss our latest edition. Until recently, anyone with a scholarly interest in Eric Hobsbawm would sooner or later be told to contact Keith McClelland. The reason was simple: He held the (virtual) keys to an extraordinary document — a PDF file that contained details of almost everything Hobsbawm ever wrote. It ran to over a hundred thirty pages and included details of multiple editions, translations, and a dizzying array of cross-references. It was — and still is — an unprecedented visualization of Hobsbawm’s productivity and commercial success. The story behind this remarkable document goes back to the early 1980s. At the time, some of Hobsbawm’s students and colleagues prepared an edited volume to celebrate his retirement from Birkbeck College, London. As the two editors — Raphael Samuel and Gareth Stedman Jones — started to put the book together, they realized that one way to mark Hobsbawm’s contribution was to commission someone to prepare a comprehensive bibliography of his writings. They invited Keith, then a labor historian and frequent attendee at Hobsbawm’s Social History seminar at London’s Institute of Historical Research, to undertake the work. Even in the early 1980s, this was an enormous task. Hobsbawm had published numerous books — single-authored and edited — and he had been involved in myriad editorial projects, ranging from the historical journal Past & Present to the multiauthor, multi-volume Storia del marxismo (History of Marxism) series, instigated by the Italian publisher Einaudi. Most of all, he had published a bewildering number of essays, articles, and reviews across a range of international publications. It is worth remembering that there was no Internet to help track down esoteric references. Keith could not turn to Project Muse or Google Books. Instead, he had to rely on the index cards of the British Library in London and Hobsbawm’s own imperfect memory. He spent long hours in the Hobsbawm residence on Nassington Road in North London chasing publication dates, identifying forgotten cross-references, and classifying unexpected translations. The end result was a thirty-page bibliography, published in 1982 as the final chapter of the edited volume Culture, Ideology and Politics: Essays for Eric Hobsbawm. It was a milestone in the world of Hobsbawm studies. For the first time, it was possible to track ideas across different texts, formats, and, in some cases, languages. Keith’s decision, taken in collaboration with the editors, to group writings by theme revealed trends and clusters that would otherwise have remained hidden. The problem was, there was still a lot more Hobsbawm left to come after 1982. He had not even published the third part of his “Ages” tetralogy — Age of Empire came out in 1987 — let alone the hundreds of articles, lectures, book chapters, op-eds, and interviews that accompanied the publication of Age of Extremes in 1994 and his memoir, Interesting Times, in 2003. This incessant production meant that Keith was continuously in the process of adding to his bibliography. The most substantial revision came in 2010, when he was invited by Eric and Marlene Hobsbawm to take stock of everything that had appeared since 1982. The bibliography mushroomed as he catalogued hundreds of new texts, many of which were associated with Hobsbawm’s newfound status as a public intellectual. Keith added entire categories to the bibliography — like “globalization” — absent from the 1982 edition. Hobsbawm died in 2012, but even this was not enough to stem the tide. Several collections of his essays were published posthumously, and interviews, lectures, and TV appearances continued to surface online. Moreover, the decision to deposit Hobsbawm’s papers in the Modern Records Centre archive at the University of Warwick opened a rich additional angle for a bibliography. It would soon be possible to compare Hobsbawm’s published and unpublished writings, as well as his private diaries, scattered correspondence, and dozens of research notebooks. The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography — which began in 2019 as part of a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council project on Hobsbawm’s intellectual biography — was initially conceived as an attempt to bring order to this increasingly chaotic bibliographical landscape. The aim was simple: We wanted to convert the most recent version of Keith’s bibliography into an open-access database, to which we would add the complete catalogue of Hobsbawm’s archive. This would then form the basis of a multilingual website that would allow anyone to search the bibliography according to a range of criteria. To preserve the spirit of Keith’s original bibliography, we also wanted to create curated lists of publications grouped under certain thematic headings, such as “Capitalism: origins, development, results,” “Jazz,” and “Labour history.” These would provide ready-made reading lists for those looking for Hobsbawm’s thoughts on a particular subject. Given that much of the hard work had already been done by Keith over the past thirty years, we expected it to be a straightforward task to convert his bibliography into a flexible digital format. Nothing could have been further from the truth. For a start, we faced endless technical challenges. Our coding wizard, Richard Hadden, struggled heroically to convert obsolete or proprietary formats into an easily accessible XML database. Nevertheless, formatting went missing, numbering systems broke halfway through sequences, and inconsistencies in presentation that passed without notice in the paper version of the bibliography were ruthlessly exposed by the exigencies of programming. We also found ourselves asking difficult conceptual questions about how our database should be organized and presented. Which should take priority in search results: the form of a publication (book, article, review, etc.) or the date of publication? Should monographs always appear higher in search results than other kinds of publication, thereby suggesting that they are the most valuable form of intellectual output? What is the proper relationship between an original text and its translations? Should the Spanish version of the website display Spanish-language translations above the English originals? In the case of texts that underwent substantial revisions, which should be the “master” version: the original or the latest edition? Most historians, librarians, and archivists are used to making these snap judgements as a matter of course — and the answers are usually complex and context-specific. But building a database and search engine is unforgiving; programming languages work according to rational, hierarchical rules. It is possible to build in fuzzy logic or clever algorithms, but some hard decisions have to be made. Incorporating unpublished material led to further issues. Our intention was to connect Hobsbawm’s papers to his published output, whether through curated lists or as links within a particular entry. In this way, someone interested in the reception and response to one of Hobsbawm’s books could start with the book itself and then move on to associated correspondence, reviews, or contractual details. But what is the status of an unpublished manuscript draft? Should it appear alongside the published book? And what counts as “associated” material? Early conference papers? Research notebooks? These questions have been the subject of intense debate by intellectual historians and scholars of political thought. We had to choose one of two answers: “yes, this belongs” or “no, let’s leave it out.” The finished product, then, turned out to be rather different than what had come before. We retained the architecture of the 1982 bibliography, but our discussions and additions transformed a static reference document into a vast and flexible database, which included outbound links to journal repositories like JSTOR and the WorldCat international library catalogue. When it went live in late 2020, the Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography became the most comprehensive and complex record of Hobsbawm’s writings currently available. When we began the process of building the new bibliography, we imagined that it would serve as a useful tool for further research on Hobsbawm and his generation of Marxist intellectuals. By making his back catalogue accessible to anyone with an internet connection, we wanted to help our colleagues, our students, and anyone interested in Hobsbawm. It was conceived as an exercise in professional service. Yet the process of compiling and revising the bibliography simultaneously revealed vital aspects of Hobsbawm’s intellectual biography, most of which have not been probed in any depth. The first and surely the most striking aspect of the bibliography is its size. The database contains more than three thousand entries. Almost all of these refer either to individual texts authored by Hobsbawm or archival boxes that contain drafts, notes, and correspondence (the latter is very fragmentary). Most reviewers and commentators have remarked on Hobsbawm’s productivity, but this bibliography lays bare its sheer scale. It would be no exaggeration to say that he was obsessed with the written word. From his earliest teenage writings to his political interventions in his nineties, everything was mediated through text. He wrote quickly, fluently, and often in one take. Regardless of the subject matter — and there were many of them — the words poured onto the page. At no point in his career does he seem to have suffered from serious writer’s block. Rather, he continued to write even through some of his most difficult personal circumstances. He kept a diary for several years as an orphaned teenager in London; he maintained a handsome portfolio of book reviews and jazz criticism as his first marriage collapsed in the early 1950s; he processed the trauma of the Communist schism of 1956 by researching and writing Primitive Rebels; and he tried to understand the terminal decline and collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and ’90s by writing endless numbers of books, articles, and essays. For Hobsbawm, writing was more than a by-product of an intellectual life; it was an intensely personal act of communication. At the same time, his bibliography shows just how well he mastered an essential academic skill: the art of repetition. He was an expert in repackaging his ideas. Student lectures became book chapters; newspaper op-eds became long essays; and key arguments found their way into a myriad of different formats. Hobsbawm was a strikingly original thinker. The range of concepts for which he became known — including the “dual revolution,” “primitive rebellion,” “invented traditions,” and “the short twentieth-century” — indicate a restless mind. But his productivity was also the result of a willingness to recycle his greatest hits. This tendency was reinforced by his international success. One of the most difficult parts of the bibliography was identifying translations, some of which were unauthorized. Transliteration of titles was often unstandardized, and therefore search engines did not always successfully detect their publication details. Separating bogus from legitimate references was a painstaking task, but it means that the database now contains the most reliable record of Hobsbawm’s international reach. We tracked hundreds of publications that were translated into at least one other language. Especially impressive were the number of translations of some of his most famous books: we identified twenty-four translations of The Age of Revolution (1962) and The Age of Capital (1987); twenty-seven translations of Nations and Nationalism Since 1780: Programme, Myth, Reality (1990); and no less than thirty-one translations of The Age of Extremes (1994). The circulation of texts in other languages multiplied the impact of his writings. In most cases, Hobsbawm had little or no input into a translation — and we know from his correspondence that he sometimes complained about the quality of the text in languages he could understand. But the truth was that each translation expanded his potential market. Without coming up with new ideas, he could reach new audiences. The written word was his passport to global fame. This virtuous circle could work the other way, too. In some cases, he trialed ideas and arguments in non-English publications before introducing them to his English-language audience. This was especially true of his writings and interventions in Italy. In the 1950s and ’60s, he explored the relevance of Antonio Gramsci in Italian before incorporating some of these ideas into his English-language work in subsequent decades. Later, in the early 1970s, he used the left-wing Italian press to develop key ideas about the future of the labor movement that he then applied to the British Labour Party after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. Another consequence of this dense web of translated texts was a time lag in the reception of Hobsbawm’s ideas. This is clearly visible in the bibliography. Translations often appeared years — sometimes decades — after the original English text. One of the best examples of this is the translation of Hobsbawm’s classic articles on the “transition debate” and his essays on labor history, most of which were originally published in English in the 1950s and ’60s. These only appeared in Spanish and Portuguese in the 1970s. The time lag pulled Hobsbawm back to questions and themes on which he had written almost nothing for many years. The staggered temporalities of translation meant that he could cash in on his fame without actually producing new work. It goes without saying that Hobsbawm’s commercial savvy is amply documented in his bibliography. For a career academic, he navigated the business of publishing with remarkable assurance. As a young scholar, he did a good deal of journalistic writing, for which he almost always received some kind of fee. Whether in the form of book reviews for the Times Literary Supplement or articles on jazz for the New Statesman, he was clearly focused on making a living from his craft. He went one step further in 1959, when he signed a contract with David Higham, one of Britain’s most formidable literary agents. This guaranteed ever more lucrative book deals and allowed him to keep close control on the sale of foreign rights. It helped that his generalist historical writing hit the market at a time in the 1960s and ’70s when demand for cheap paperbacks was soaring. He quickly became one of the lucky few academics who was able to make money from something that was also central to his intellectual identity. Beyond Hobsbawm himself, the bibliography speaks to the shape of both the historical profession and left-wing intellectual life in postwar Europe. One of the most obvious points is that these were overwhelmingly male spaces. There are vanishingly few women listed in the bibliography. They do not appear much as coeditors, collaborators, or even subjects of research. Even the interviews listed in the database are invariably with men or by men. Some women, such as academic and fellow Communist Margot Heinemann, clearly had an important influence on Hobsbawm, but their absence in the database raises questions about their absence in his writings. The days and weeks of childcare that enabled Hobsbawm to travel to international conferences with two young children at home in the 1960s was also a precondition for his voluminous published output. When some of his female students took him to task for neglecting women’s history in the late 1970s, they were not simply fighting a historiographical battle. They were also pushing back against an intellectual world overwhelmingly led by men who relied on the hidden labor of their wives, assistants, and secretaries. The hundreds of cross-references in the bibliography also reflect the importance of intellectual and political contacts. Hobsbawm’s professional universe was made up of a dense web of overlapping international networks that steadily expanded over time. At each stage of his career, the things he published were a result of personal connections with magazine editors, old Cambridge alumni, foreign academics, and political activists. When he was an apprentice historian in the late 1940s and early ’50s, his publications reflected his limited reach, which only stretched as far as British labor historians and economic historians, and a handful of French historians connected to the Annales school. By the 1970s, he was publishing a lot of material in places he had visited in previous years: He was a regular contributor to left-wing Italian newspapers and journals, and he was being translated into Spanish and Portuguese for dissemination across Latin America. Like most intellectuals, his professional networks were unevenly distributed. By the time he died, his books and articles were easily accessible in the Americas, Western Europe, and South Asia. But the paucity of translations into Eastern European or Asian languages, let alone any major African language, indicate those regions where his ideas did not reach a wide audience. It is surely no coincidence that these were also the regions that received the least coverage in his work. Hobsbawm’s bibliography stands as a stark reminder that the subjects scholars choose to write about are, in most cases, determined by who they know and where they have been. The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography was intended as a tool for understanding the published corpus of one of the world’s best-known Marxist historians. However, the digitization and compilation process also revealed the ways that intellectual capital was built and sustained in the second half of the twentieth century. It was not Hobsbawm’s intrinsic genius that made him a superstar; it was his combination of strategic networking, commercial intelligence, and facility with the written word. Focusing on the physical infrastructure of Hobsbawm’s writings is a reminder to scholars of intellectual life that the form in which ideas are packaged is almost as important as the content. And this is surely just as true in the age of Twitter as it was during the golden age of the mass-market Penguin paperback. Emile Chabal is a reader in history at the University of Edinburgh. He works on twentieth-century European political and intellectual history, with a special interest in France. Anne Perez is a historian based in Mobile, Alabama.

VIRTUAL IAS Festival: Making (in) the Digital Humanities | Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) - UCL – University College London,"Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) 
              05 May 2021, 3:00 pm–4:30 pm             With Alda Terracciano, Paul Fyfe, Julianne Nyhan and Adam Crymble. This event is free. Please join the IAS Virtual Forum here for the event.  Often accused of lacking theoretical basis and insight, acts of making in the Digital Humanities are in many ways misunderstood. Recently scholarship is showing the kinds of making and modelling that the Digital Humanities engages in—including, but not limited to, digitisation and imaging; coding and semantic enrichment; interpretative modelling with immersive technologies; and the humanistic fabrication of lost or poorly understood historical objects—to be rich, complex and sometimes even dark processes. Digitisations, for example, have recently been explored as complex sites, where labour, infrastructure, affect, funding, ideology, and more, shape digital resources in configurations that are often not detectable on the surface level of the shiny interface. So too, the objects that Digital Humanities creates, the digital infrastructures that it harnesses and the physical devices that it uses, are increasingly understood to partake of, and give rise to, deeply problematic asymmetries of the wider digital ecosystem: like the racialised and devalued labour forces that underpin it, the economies of exploitation that operate through platform capitalism or the environmental impact of server farms and cryptocurrency mining. In this way, making can be understood as occupying a complex role in the Digital Humanities, it can be a site of, or be implicated acts of liberation and oppression; creativity and constriction. Making in the Digital Humanities can be used to create or imagine new worlds and / or reamplify the worst tendencies of the digitally-mediated world we already have. This panel will reflect on the central role that making plays in the Digital Humanities, where the endeavour to know, imagine and explore through making is both distinctive to Digital Humanities itself and a potentially innovative epistemological contribution to the wider Humanities. It will ask: What is ‘making’ in the Digital Humanities? What frameworks and perspectives can we use for thinking-through the act of making in the Digital Humanities in all its complexity? What are the implications and complicities of making in the present context and how can Digital Humanities respond to this? And what of making in the wider Humanities – how is Digital Humanities advancing or problematizing this? Participants: Alda Terracciano, Paul Fyfe, Julianne Nyhan (chair) and Adam Crymble (chair) This talk forms part of the IAS fifth anniversary festival on the theme of ‘Alternative Epistemologies’.

Tom Lippincott receives primary appointment from Krieger School of Arts and Sciences - Center for Language and Speech Processing,"Assistant Research Professor and Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) member Tom Lippincott has received a primary appointment in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. Starting on July 1, Lippincott will assume the position of Director of Digital Humanities for the Alexander Grass Humanities Institute (AGHI). He will also hold secondary appointments in the Department of Computer Science and Human Language Technology Center of Excellence. Previously, Lippincott held a secondary appointment with AGHI, where he already has collaborations underway with faculty in the departments of English, History, and Near Eastern Studies. “It was tremendously gratifying to learn that scholars in the humanities find our interactions to be as compelling and productive as I do, to the point of committing the resources that made this possible,” Lippincott said. “It reflects a sort of trust and endorsement that’s critical for interdisciplinary research.” The goal of Lippincott’s research is to develop machine learning techniques that help scholars find interesting patterns in primary sources that may be obscured by normal practices of the field or fundamental limitations of human cognition. Lippincott believes that AI can help historians sift through great quantities of information to tease out and make connections that humans might miss. Lippincott’s passion for this research began during his undergraduate education at University of Chicago, when he noticed that his interest in humanistic domains – such as literature, poetry, history, and philosophy – was paired with a fundamentally computational way of thinking. “That basic observation has guided my research trajectory ever since, and I’m excited to see what insights the computational perspective brings when applied to some of our most-venerated cultural artifacts,” Lippincott said. “Machine learning for scholarship in the humanities is limited by how disruptive collaborations can be to both research communities. Participating in them simultaneously will provide a valuable window into how these disruptions can be mitigated, misunderstandings avoided, and collaborations fostered.” Lippincott plans to remain an active member of the CLSP community, and hopes that this appointment can help expand the center’s research capabilities. Center Director Hynek Hermansky certainly sees it that way, and is excited by what Lippincott’s new appointment could bring to CLSP. “Computational linguistics is traditionally not applied that much in humanities research, and Tom’s expertise can make a lot of difference there,” Hermansky said. “So, speaking for CLSP, we are excited that Tom’s new appointment is opening this new area in language processing for us.” Lippincott says that being at Hopkins has been a big factor in his ability to pursue this work, mentioning the practicality and research vision of both the Whiting School of Engineering and KSAS and the enthusiastic engagement from graduate students and faculty at both schools as being immensely helpful. The ability to collaborate and conduct research with fellow CLSP members has also played a crucial role in Lippincott getting to this point. “The CLSP, in my mind, is what makes this endeavor possible,” Lippincott said. “There are only a handful of places in the world that have drawn together so many exceptional researchers in NLP, and areas like knowledge base construction, optical character recognition, crowdsourcing, and natural language understanding have direct use-cases in the humanities.” 
There are no upcoming events.

Home,"Technology is global, but where we live affects how we apply digital solutions to humanities work. We all have what Roopika Risam described as a digital humanities (DH) “accent”. This seminar series explores those accents by looking at DH research here, and there, and over there too. This is a chance to build greater global awareness and empathy about regional and local approaches to digital humanities in the twenty-first century. It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed differently around the globe, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots. This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon our successful “Digital Humanities Long View” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice. Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.

The Disappearance of Books Threatens to Erode Fine Arts Libraries,"Hyperallergic 
					Sensitive to Art & its Discontents				 Posters outside the Doty Fine Arts Building at the University of Texas at Austin (photo by and courtesy Abigail Sharp) Public libraries are experiencing a surge in use that few could have predicted even a decade ago. This renaissance has renewed interest in the library as a space for access to books, to technology, and to art. But libraries are no longer solely filled with books. Many are shifting to become multi-use and more digitally driven spaces. Yet as libraries create access to a digital future, the books that have traditionally inhabited them are being displaced at an alarming rate. This leaves many asking: Does acceptance of digital resources mean that the books must go? And what is at stake when artists, art historians, students, and the public can no longer engage in the act of browsing the stacks as part of the process of creating and researching art? While the philosophical debate over what a library should be rages across the country and beyond, some institutions are shifting from philosophy to action, removing books to make way for other initiatives. At the University of Texas at Austin, around 75,000 fine arts books, journals, and other materials have already been moved by the College of Fine Arts and the University of Texas Libraries, as Hyperallergic reported in December. Many of the removed materials now reside in an off-site location near UT’s J.J. Pickle Research Campus or the Texas A&M joint library storage facility. At many libraries, the prime real estate occupied by books is being requisitioned to make way for new digital humanities initiatives like virtual reality experiences or “Makerspaces” cordoned off for 3D printing. In the case of UT-Austin’s Fine Arts Library, books and other analog materials were removed to accommodate a new space called The Foundry. As the mission page for the collaborative space notes, this is a joint initiative of the University of Texas Libraries and the College of Fine Arts meant to be available to all UT students, faculty, and staff. Yet the success of such 3D printing labs is often precarious and dubious. As many librarians and digital humanists have pointed out, installing a Makerspace in your library is not a panacea. A 3D-printed version of the Temple of Vesta in Rome from within the Copy + Paste 3D printing lab in the architecture gallery at the Carnegie Museum of Art (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) The most effective 3D printing labs in fact work in tandem with visible art — original or reproduced — in order to show students the relationship between objects and their replicated form. This is certainly the case at the Carnegie Museum of Art’s new Copy + Paste makerspace embedded in the Hall of Architecture. However, removing books, special collections, and other primary materials from a library space often removes essential sources of inspiration from students’ immediate view. At UT-Austin, the curators of the Blanton Museum of Art have expressed their displeasure with the current and future plans for the Fine Arts Library, noting in a letter to the dean of the College of Fine Arts, Doug Dempster: “Having timely access to the collection of the Fine Arts Library is essential to our mission of providing intellectually rigorous and engaging museum content to our audiences at the University and in the wider community.” The Blanton Museum, the Fine Arts Library, and academic departments at UT-Austin work in tandem to inform students and the general public about fine art. “The Foundry” space in the Fine Arts Library at UT-Austin (photo by and courtesy Rabun Taylor) The Foundry, it turns out, was only the first stage in a plan that has developed into a complete takeover of the Fine Arts Library. In 2017, an entire floor of books was swept away almost overnight, without consultation of faculty or students, to make way for a new high-tech design program, the School of Design and Creative Technologies. Dean Dempster offered a glimpse of the vision for this new design school in a talk at the 2018 SXSW Interactive Conference, suggesting that “fine” arts is an anachronism and should yield primacy to more entrepreneurial, STEM-oriented creative arts such as video game design. Unable to find space to accommodate the School of Design and Creative Technologies, or to raise capital for a new building, Dempster seized the fourth floor of the Fine Arts Library last summer. According to numerous sources Hyperallergic spoke to, he then announced both verbally and in emails his intention to relocate the rest of the library’s collection — an estimated 200,000 items — and appropriate the fifth and largest floor of the Doty Building for the nascent school. This was a bridge too far for faculty and students, who have organized a movement to save what remains of the Fine Arts Library. In the meantime, all plans for the library’s future have been put on hold and a working group led by UT Libraries is evaluating alternative solutions to the current impasse. A poster protesting the downsizing of UT-Austin’s Fine Arts Library in the E. William Doty Fine Arts Building (photo by and courtesy Abigail Sharp) The University of Texas at Austin isn’t the only large public university planning to do away with its art library. The University of Wisconsin Library System has recently released a Facilities Master Plan, which proposes to eliminate the Kohler Art Library by 2030. Like UT-Austin, UW-Madison is planning to slash the overall number of books available on campus, in this case to 15% of the total collection. The Kohler Art Library’s holdings would eventually be reduced by 50%, with the other half moved off-site. UW-Madison’s Vice Provost for Libraries and University Librarian, Edward V. Van Gemert, echoes UT-Austin Dean Dempster’s reasoning for the reduction in browsable books, saying: “The vision of the plan is to strengthen the role of campus libraries in the academic pursuits of the University by providing the needed spaces and services at strategic locations across campus in alignment with campus planning.” Across the country, many university libraries are engaged in a book purge. This has meant reassessing the use of library spaces and consolidating book holdings in a bid to attract more visitors. In states like Missouri and Kansas, libraries have begun to spend more and more of their annual budgets on digital subscriptions and spaces for people, rather than on the acquisition of physical books. As in Austin and Madison, such shifts have often been met with resistance. At Syracuse University in New York, there was a faculty uproar over the proposed movement of books to a far-away warehouse. The struggle ultimately resulted in the university building a 20,000-square-foot storage facility nearby for over 1 million books — guaranteeing next-business-day delivery. With space at a premium and books ever-multiplying, how can we continue to make the case for browsable libraries dedicated to fine arts on major research campuses across the United States? University of Texas sophomore Abigail Sharp (a Corporate Communication major with a minor in Art History who is working on a certificate in Museum Studies) perhaps put it best. “The numerous irrelevant, algorithmically selected results from an online database do not compare to the titles found so close to one another when wandering the stacks of the library,” she told me. “Some of the best research and learning materials I’ve come across have been analog, and physically holding and flipping through print makes all the difference in learning and retention. There is a way to incorporate the new design major with the current Fine Arts Library and Building, and that does not require relocation of analog resources.” Before there was 3D printing, there were plaster casts. The Blanton Museum of Art has a number of classical casts that professors and curators teach with in tandem with the Fine Arts Library’s reserves. (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) Students and professors on campus at the University of Texas at Austin have not accepted the initial phases of the School of Design and Creative Technologies takeover without pushback and are working to halt the final phase of Dean Dempster’s plan. A petition on Change.org already has thousands of signatures from local, national, and international scholars and students hoping to save the Fine Arts Library, and the campus has been fully canvassed with posters and activists in the past few weeks. On Monday, the UT-Austin Faculty Council voted to adopt a resolution protesting Dean Dempster’s actions, while students picketed and leafleted the campus in protest of the plan. Many might ask why it is so important to save a few books that can simply be recalled from storage if one really needs them. However, to many at the University of Texas, the University of Wisconsin, and other large universities across the country, this fight is about maintaining the close links between research, art, and the visceral act of discovery in the stacks. The digital future should indeed be embraced, but books are a technology that should be just as readily available as a 3D printer or VR headset to the artists of tomorrow. Update, 3/28/2018: According to a UT-Austin spokesperson and the school’s FAQ page on the issue, there is now no current plan to close the Fine Arts Library or remove its materials from the Doty Fine Arts Building. This week, a mural in Belarus is a symbol of defiance, an excellent report about the 2020 election big lie, Chomsky and the dangers ahead, if you like Wordle, you might enjoy Heardle, and much more. The studio is a place of self-mirroring, self-haunting, a space where the artist plays out the day-to-day reality of the fantasy of being an artist.

 How devastating that there’s a trend of libraries doing away with books.  I can attest to the importance of the “visceral act of discovery in the stacks.” (I love this phrase, Ms. Bond.) Some of the most thought-provoking and artistically inspiring books I’ve ever read were found by accident as I was strolling through the stacks on my way to fetch other books. The joy of just browsing books based on interesting titles and covers is, I fear, a joy that students will not know in 20-30 years. The unfortunate truth is that books are not accessed anywhere near as much as they were before the internet. Many libraries are merely responding to demand. The need for digital media access is much greater. You ask, “how can we continue to make the case for browsable libraries dedicated to fine arts?” or, I assume, any other subject. The answer is simple: use the books that are there. Check them out, or at least lift them off the shelf and use them, and then put them on a reshelving cart. Libraries keep track of what gets used — so don’t think you’re being helpful if you reshelve books yourself. You actually may be contributing to the collection’s demise, by making it appear that the books are unused. Despite all the public lamenting of how “the books are going away,” the truth is, they’re not. Books that get used get to stay, or get replaced when they wear out. Books that no one is using are a waste of space, and they get removed to make way for new books, or for services or spaces that the library’s patrons are demanding. I work in a public library, and we routinely weed books that are outdated, worn out, or simply unused. We don’t have space to keep them; we free up the space for new books that people actually want to read, or sometimes for new space configurations that the public is asking for. The needs of a research library, such as the Fine Arts Library, are different. Such libraries should and do keep books that are in less demand. But no library has infinite space; no library owns, or can keep, every book ever printed on a subject. The best way to make sure a library collection stays is to use that collection. Thank you very much for this informative response. I learned a lot and will try and encourage people to do this in the future. I think that Abigail Sharp has nailed it “physically holding and flipping through print makes all the difference in learning and retention.” Forty-eight years ago I commented to a university art librarian that books would one day be done away with in libraries. I had no idea about PDAs, or digital storage, although there was microfiche. I only wish I had been wrong. While I sometimes look something up on line, and I appreciate the speed of finding what I’m looking for, there is no substitute for finding what I didn’t *know* I was looking for by browsing bookshelves, or “flipping through” the pages of a physical, hand-held book. All too often ‘management’ has little understanding or no understanding of what actually goes on ‘in the trenches’, so to speak. And, of course, it’s a lot easier to ‘relocate’ books than it is to do the hard work of ‘managing’, i.e., actually finding the funds for new facilities. p.s. Just *read* ‘management’s’ statements. They’re full of nothing but empty managementese — a dreadful language that clouds the mind. Indiana University has lost its dedicated Fine Arts Library to an unlikely foe – the Eskenazi Museum of Art (formerly the IU Art Museum).  The museum began a two-year renovation program last spring with the goal of modernizing the facilities and improving dedicated conservation and education spaces.  Unfortunately, the plan also involves the assumption of the Fine Arts Library.  Technically a part of the museum building, the Fine Arts Library and a small lobby area/exhibition space are located where the museum and the Fine Arts building converge on the second floor.  To the best of my knowledge, IU is neither deaccessioning titles nor moving art history texts to offsite storage.  Former FAL volumes will simply be moved a couple of blocks away to the main campus library, Wells Library.  However, I consider the loss of the FAL to be a huge loss to the department.  Besides, the upper floors of Wells Library are generally unpleasant. “A library without scrolls is not a library!” – Alexandria circa 30 B.C.E.

Topic Modeling Headline News About the Anti-Vietnam War Movement in the 1960s: Results and Resources – Adam Tomasi,"Adam Tomasi World History PhD Student @ Northeastern University, Boston Below is a detailed description of the results I arrived at in my Digital Humanities Certificate project at Northeastern, with some helpful resources for anyone who would like to pursue historical topic modeling. My 3,000-word writeup on the entire project, with more references and methodological discussion, can be found here. My latest digital humanities project is a topic model of headline news coverage about the anti-Vietnam War movement between 1964 and 1966. In February 1965, President Lyndon Johnson escalated United States military presence in Vietnam and called up 50,000 draftees. This escalation quickly galvanized the peace movement because the Vietnam War would since have a more direct impact on young people’s lives. Although students traditionally received “2-S” deferments from the draft, President Johnson would revise this policy in 1965 to deny deferments to students below a certain class rank and score on an aptitude test administered by the Selective Service. Even students who maintained their deferments had friends and family affected by Johnson’s military escalation. Both young and old had deep political or philosophical commitments that guided their activism even if their personal lives were not directly upended by the war. Headline news shaped how a reading public understood the anti-Vietnam War movement at this time. Unlike editorials or advertisements that have a more obvious bent, headline news is ostensibly an imminent, neutral recounting of past events. But headline news is not neutral; journalists have to make choices about the selection, arrangement, and prioritization of data, which shapes the topics represented in my corpus. Similarly, my own decisions about the data that went into my corpus were not objective. One rewarding aspect of pursuing digital humanities has been learning to detect biases in other people’s data (a reflective process) while understanding my own biases when creating data (a reflexive process).  Topic modeling, a method used in the digital humanities, can improve our close readings by computationally generating patterns in words from large amounts of text. I used MALLET (Machine Learning for Language Toolkit), a program created out of UMass Amherst, to generate word associations in a collection (corpus) of 118 text files from PDFs of newspaper articles about my subject. MALLET runs from the command line (the ultimate “back-end”) on your computer, and it produces results pretty quickly. But one of the links below includes a Topic Modeling Tool that runs MALLET through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool that only requires changing some settings and ing a few icons. I originally ran MALLET through the command line to get more familiar with the back-end, but eventually used the Topic Modeling Tool because it generated clean CSV data that helped me create some cool visualizations, discussed below. References and Resources Process and Results The topics These are the twenty topics that MALLET generated from my corpus. MALLET does not generate topic labels; the researcher has to decide what those are. I’ve indicated in bold, on the left side, what I assessed these topics to be. The numbers in parentheses are the topic number, referring not to “most important” or “least important” like a ranking, but simply a random order. The decimal values represent the frequency of each topic’s occurrence in the entire corpus (and those values are usually between 0 and 1; MALLET may be giving values above 1 to indicate common discourses, but I have to explore this further).

For example, for “Protest at Ceremonies” (topic 7) I knew from my corpus that students at Amherst College and New York University walked out in protest when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara received honorary degrees at each institution’s commencement in 1966. For “March Leaders” (topic 14), I knew that articles in my corpus referred to the following leaders, whose names are closely associated in the topic: Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Benjamin Spock (famous author of a childrearing manual, turned anti-war activist), Norman Thomas (former Socialist Party candidate for president), and Sanford Gottlieb (march coordinator for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, or SANE). Deciding each topic label was an iterative process of looking back at the texts themselves but remaining faithful to the clusters that MALLET generated. In an earlier iteration of this project, I intended to select the few topics that were most coherent and interesting. I since decided to present all of the topics, messy or not, after discussions with NULab colleagues and my NULab Research Fellowship advisor, Laura Nelson. Doing this acknowledges that topic modeling is more random, and less crystal-clear, than one may previously anticipate. Change over time When designing my visualizations, I was inspired by Robert Nelson’s Mining the Dispatch, a topic model of the entire run of Richmond, Virginia’s Daily Dispatch newspaper during the Civil War. Nelson not only identified topics, such as fugitive slave advertising, he also used line graphs to represent the proportion of each topic in his corpus separated by month and year.  To create my own visualizations, I used the CSV data generated by the one- Topic Modeling Tool referenced above. This CSV had the frequencies by which every topic appeared in each of my documents. Once I named my topics, I changed the column headings accordingly. Because I named each text file according to a year-month-day convention, I could produce line graphs that identified the frequencies of each topic over time. For these line graphs, I focused exclusively on headline news between March 1964 (the earliest month/year in my corpus) and December 1965. Out of my 118 text files, 44 were from 1964 and 1965 (CSV). I narrowed the scope of my visualizations to make them more useful to readers. When I attempted to visualize the entire corpus, or even just the year 1966, the line graph was one giant blur. I mostly excluded topics where the graph only showed a single spike in one month, but kept one example of that below. In a future stage of this project, I will keep working with visualization tools to improve my ability to represent a much larger corpus. See individual photos of the graphs here. Some conclusions that become very clear:  For Students and the Draft, the frequencies increase significantly starting in March 1965 after President Johnson’s announcement the previous February that the military would be conscripting 50,000 people for Vietnam. The Protest Coordination topic has frequencies almost always above 0 because the headline news coverage regularly focused on the leaders and personalities involved in planning anti-war protests, especially notables like Columbia sociologist Staughton Lynd, Dr. King, or David Dellinger (one of the Chicago Seven in 1968). With the Marches (Location) topic, there is an uptick in reporting about the many marches taking place in the streets and parks of cities like New York, after the Tonkin Gulf resolution in August 1964 committed the US to officially fighting a war in Vietnam (to say nothing about the US military’s longer involvement during the 1950s). The other graphs may not suggest immediately significant conclusions, but that’s because visualizations alone do not tell the story. The researcher always has to connect the visualization to the texts themselves, but the visuals operate as useful representations of trends in the corpus (especially when a corpus is very large, which makes close reading one-by-one impossible). While I excluded topics where the graphs did not have an interesting trend line (due to the limitations of my corpus), I’ve included one below because it suggests interesting future research questions: This graph, representing vigils, has two spikes in March and May 1965 with no occurrences elsewhere. This may be an issue with the corpus, or with ending my visualizations at December 1965. But anti-war vigils might have truly been less frequent (or less reported on) than marches and rallies between 1964 and 1965. One of the most interesting vigils, held by SDS members half a mile away from President Johnson’s Texas ranch, took place in December 1966. If I expand the visualization to 1966, there may be other vigils leading up to that moment which made the tactic popular for non-religious organizations in addition to clergy against the Vietnam War. Investigations such as these demonstrate topic modeling’s potential as a tool for examining change over time, and for understanding more clearly how mainstream news outlets chronicle social movement histories.Thanks for reading!

#DH­H21 Themes | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki,"Helsinki Di­gital Hu­man­it­ies Hack­a­thon #DH­H21 will have seven thematics areas of interest with one or more groups per topic, each with up to eight participants under the auspices of the group leaders. Group leaders: Maciej Jan­icki, Kati Kallio, Mari Sarv The group will conduct research on the corpora of Finnic oral folk poetry: Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot (Old Poems of the Finnish People), which in addition to Finnish contains material in Karelian, Izhorian and Votic languages, and Eesti Regilaulude Andmebaas (Estonian Runosongs’ Database). The corpora contain written records of original folk poems, including epics, lyrics, occasional songs (e.g. wedding songs) and charms. From the computational perspective, the datasets are challenging because of large variation in terms of orthography and dialect. The songs contain recurring themes, characters, formulas (fixed short expressions) and overlapping text fragments, but due to the surface-level variation identifying those similarities is a research question for unsupervised language processing. The data, tools and supervision will be provided by members of the project: Formulaic Intertextuality, Thematic Networks and Poetic Variation across Regional Cultures of Finnic Oral Folk Poetry (FILTER). The group can choose to concentrate on either one of the datasets (Finnish or Estonian) or a comparison of both. It is recommended that at least half of the group has high proficiency in either Finnish or Estonian (depending on the chosen dataset). Possible research questions include: Expertise or interest in the following areas will be especially useful: Group leaders: Antti Kanner, Pihla Toivanen, Eliisa Vainikka, Riikka Era It is commonly accepted that the emergence of social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, have changed and challenged the media landscape in important ways. However, because of the sparse availability of concurrent media and social media data, many aspects of the interaction between social media and traditional news media have been left unstudied. This has changed of late, as Twitter has improved the accessibility of its data for research purposes. At the same time, the Flows of Power -project has managed to acquire full dumps of the journalistic output of multiple major Finnish media outlets. The group seeks to find different ways to study the interaction between digital newsmedia journalism and Twitter. The topic will be centred on comparing the presences of and debates around two citizen initiative campaigns in social media and political newsmedia: one for same-sex marriage (Tasa-arvoinen avioliittolaki 2017) and one for legal gender recognition (Translaki). Workflows and analyses will be geared to capture dynamics and interactions related to, for example: The main computational challenges of this topic are mapping different phenomenon arising from Twitter data to newsmedia data, and vice versa. This involves, for example The data available for the group includes all articles from Helsingin Sanomat (the biggest Finnish broadside newspaper), YLE (public broadcast company), Iltalehti (national tabloid) and STT (the main Finnish news agency) between 2011 and 2017, as well as the metadata of YLE’s radio and TV broadcasts. We have also access to Twitter's historical API. Group leaders: Jani Marjanen, Lidia Pivovarova, Axel Jean-Caurant, Martin Gasteiner The international newspapers group at DHH21 will develop a multilingual case that investigates which places dominated the news reporting during the Great War between 1914 and 1918. The group will identify news articles that relate to the war and extract names of places in order to discover which war efforts were covered in the large multilingual collection of historical news.  The digitized newspapers are provided by the project “NewsEye: A digital investigator for historical newspapers”. The NewsEye collection includes digitized newspapers from Austria, France, and Finland in five languages, namely German, French, Finnish, Swedish, and English. We assume that at least one person in the group would know each of these languages, though it is not required to know any of them to join the group (except for English). In addition to data collections, NewsEye provides text processing tools, accessible in the user interface or from API, though it is possible to use anything else to analyse the collection. The aim is not to describe the different battles and war efforts as such, but to compare which locations seemed relevant depending on the viewpoint of the different language papers. Helsinki, Vienna, and Paris got their news through different channels. Consequently, the imagination of what and where things happened during the Great War looked different in those places. Through a systematic comparison, we may be able to understand the spatial imaginaries of war. Possible tasks are: Group leaders: Mikko Tolonen, Iiro Tiihonen, Ville Vaara At Helsinki Computational History Group we have created a dataset of text reuses in the Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO). This dataset was created by running BLAST on EEBO-TCP and ECCO and sidestepping the OCR-problems that often hamper text mining of ECCO. We tracked each case of text reuse of strings of 50 characters or more totalling millions of text reuse cases. The task of this hackathon group is to use this text reuse dataset to study eighteenth-century intertextuality through the uses of English translations of Pierre Bayle’s Historical and Critical Dictionary. This is not the first time that digital humanities project focuses on text reuse cases in dictionaries (Allen et al. 2010; Leca-Tsiomis 2013). The aim of this project is to also learn from these earlier experiences. Research interests This group is particularly well suited for students with a computational background. We aim to create workflows that make the task of using and analysing the text reuse data more convenient. Computer scientists joining the group have the chance of developing tools that tackle challenging historical data, and contribute to the real research questions of historical text reusage. The developed tools would have great potential for further use in later analysis of the dataset beyond the hackathon project. The dataset is very intriguing also from the perspective of eighteenth-century studies. We will focus on the concept of remediation by studying the little known phenomena of text reuse at large scale. We will also study translations as intellectual activity and switch the interest of knowledge from authors to publishing networks where the role of the author is seen in a different light.

The group’s objective is to learn how to use public speech data, in this case parliamentary linked open data, for studying pressing societal issues of the past. Moreover, the group develops and uses tools that allow to identify themes, topics, and place names in the debates, and to classify the debates by using related metadata such as speaker information. The Finnish data exemplifies the parliamentary corpora and the linked open data standards that are developed and used internationally. Parliaments are the main legislative institutions and key places of decision-making and political discussion in our democratic societies. The parliament is a national arena of speaking and debating, to which the Members of the Parliament (MPs), the “people’s representatives”, are elected in regional districts.The parties and the MPs align with political ideologies, but also with geographic areas such as urban centres, the countryside, or their home region. Moreover, locations are markers in the debates about policy issues, such as the environment or foreign policy, where a reference to the Soviet Union or Chernobyl can play different rhetorical roles. The group, thus, will study the different ways in which parliamentary politics and place are related. The group can approach the question from several perspectives in their project, including: The parliamentary debate material and the related metadata are provided by the project Semantic Parliament – ParliamentSampo: Linked Open Data Service for Studying Political Culture (SEMPARL) (https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/projects/semparl/en/). As the parliamentary material is mainly in Finnish, basic knowledge of Finnish is recommended though not mandatory; the computational tasks, in particular, can be carried out in English. Besides the data, the SEMPARL project will provide the group with basic tools or a user interface which allow to browse and search the data. Possible tasks for the project are: Group leaders: Daniela Ceccon, Stefano Ceccon  Terms and conditions of employment are regulated on the society level and have further impact on each individual contract. When independent unions and employers (or employers’ organizations) negotiate those terms and conditions of employment and regulate relations between the parties, the activity is referred to as ‘collective bargaining’. The written document resulting from this negotiation is a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). While being very important for the workers and for the employers, these documents (CBAs) are not easy to find and their content is often unknown even to those who are covered by them. Since 2012, the WageIndicator Foundation (http://wageindicator.org) has been collecting and coding CBAs on a global scale in the WageIndicator Collective Agreements Database (http://wageindicator.org/cbadatabase). The Database currently contains 1600 collective agreements from more than 50 countries and written in 28 languages. The texts have been manually annotated according to 250 labour rights related questions on nine main topics – Social security and pensions, Training, Employment contracts, Sickness and disability, Health and medical assistance, Work/family balance arrangements, Gender equality issues, Wages, Working hours – and the relevant clauses (i.e., parts of text) for each question have been manually selected. Part of the annotation has been carried out under the SSHOC project (https://sshopencloud.eu/) and supported by the CLARIN Research Infrastructure (https://www.clarin.eu/). The resulting datasets contain the collective agreements’ full texts and all the clauses assigned to each question. Research interests The uniqueness and richness of such a dataset gives the opportunity to do research on many levels, as it sheds light on how different topics related to working conditions are addressed in different countries and expressed in different languages. The task of the hackathon group is to gain qualitative insights from the data and see how this output can be potentially shared/made visible for broader groups of Social Sciences and Humanities scientists via services provided by Research Infrastructures. In this group, students with (digital) humanities background and students with an interest in computational language processing, e.g. multilingual texts analysis, will find something exciting to work on. Research ideas for this group might include: Such work will contribute to the research on collective agreements provisions and ultimately help workers, trade unions and employers all over the world to know more about their labour rights at sectoral or company level. Possible tasks to exemplify the work in the group Group leaders: Ajda Pretnar, Matej Klemen, Ruben Ros The group will focus on the comparison of parliamentary debates before and during Covid across Europe from a linguistic, sociological, politological and/or computational perspective. The group’s objective will be to learn how to use comparable parliamentary corpora from various European countries that are annotated with metadata such as speaker and session information and linguistic annotations such as morphosyntactic and named entity tags for studying societal issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The group will also learn how to use Orange (https://orangedatamining.com), a visual programming tool for data mining and machine learning, which means coding skills are not required for exploring the data set. Computer scientists will be able to use their skills to create advanced custom widgets for data processing and analysis. National parliamentary data is a verified communication channel between the elected political representatives and society members in any democracy. One of the most important characteristics of parliamentary data is its direct correspondence with concurrent events, including the ones with a global impact on human health, social life, and economics such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the data synchronically and diachronically in a cross-lingual context, we can obtain important insights into transnational characteristics as well as track the pan-European discussion in times of crisis. The parliamentary corpora will be provided by the CLARIN ERIC ParlaMint project (currently available in Bulgarian, Croatian, Polish, and Slovenian) and is supported by the SSHOC project (https://sshopencloud.eu/). Its goal is to compile a collection of comparable corpora of debates from national parliaments from all over Europe in a harmonized format, covering both the data from the period of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as older, reference data. The first version of the corpora have already been processed linguistically and enriched with metadata, made searchable through popular concordancers for online querying as well as downloadable from the CLARIN repository for independent handling. By the time of the hackathon, a new version with many new languages will be available (English, Dutch, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Czech, Italian, Turkish, Danish, Hungarian, French, Latvian, Romanian, and Belgian Dutch/French). Possible topics and tasks for the group are: P.O. Box 4

Word Embeddings and Their Role in Synonym Ring Construction – The Digital Humanities Commons,"During the past couple of months, I have been trying to come up with an efficient way of constructing synonym rings for query expansion in a library discovery system (i.e., the online search interface of a library). I am doing this because I was given a list of e-books on the subject of Digital Humanities (DH) with the purpose of making them more discoverable on KU Leuven Libraries’ discovery platform. In my previous blogpost, I described what synonym rings are, but simply put, you can think of them as groups of similar words and phrases that should be treated as equivalent for the purpose of information retrieval. An example can be found in Figure 1, where each line forms a different synonym ring. If a user enters a search term that can be found in one of the rings, the rest of the words in the ring will also be added to the query and, thus, the query will be expanded. In this blogpost, my goal is to briefly explain the method that I chose to tackle the task of synonym ring construction. The discovery system used by the KU Leuven Libraries already expands certain query terms with their variant forms using thesauri (such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings) and Wikipedia. So, I wanted to try something different. Inspired by the courses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence, and Corpus Linguistics that I took during the previous semester of the KU Leuven Master’s in Digital Humanities, I wanted to test the suitability of an NLP technique for synonym ring construction. After doing some reading on query expansion, I decided that I should give word embeddings a try.  A word embedding is a list of numbers (a vector) that represents a word. For example, instead of representing the word “Belgium” with letters, we could use a series of numbers that would look like the one in Figure 2. In fact, the vector in Figure 2 is the actual vector that represents the word “Belgium” in a model that I have trained. While there are many ways of obtaining word embeddings, for this project I only considered the word2vec method, presented by Mikolov et al. in 2013.1 2 The word2vec method is known for its ability to pick up semantic similarity.3 4 The numbers that end up in the resulting embeddings are not random: similar words will have similar vectors, which is a feature that comes in handy when creating synonym rings. Turning words into vectors is useful, as, with the help of a similarity measure, it allows us to easily compute how similar to each other two words are. This is where things get interesting when it comes to synonym rings. Training a word2vec model on a relatively small corpus of texts on DH gave me word embeddings that reflect how words are used in that specific domain. I was then able to use the cosine similarity measure to see which words (and phrases) are most similar to my target word (or phrase) according to my model. For example, when trying to see which 10 words or phrases are most similar to the phrase “digital humanities” based on the word embeddings that I obtained, the following list was returned:  Granted, not all of these words and phrases could be included in a synonym ring for the concept of “digital humanities.” However, it was still exciting to see that the top two results were the abbreviation of the exact same term, “DH,” and its predecessor, “humanities computing.” While not exactly synonyms, other results, such as “digital humanists,” could still be considered as good candidates for the “digital humanities” synonym ring. Of course, not all results for all the concepts for which I wanted to create synonym rings were as successful as those for “digital humanities.” Even so, I still consider this method to be promising. First of all, my corpus was (relatively) small compared to what is usually considered a large enough corpus for this type of model training. Given more data to train the model, the results would have been even more accurate. The current results definitely require a human editor to weed them out before adding them to a synonym ring; yet again, even if I had more training data and better results, I think it would still be a good idea to have a human in the loop to make sure that no false positives or biased terms infiltrate the rings. I hope that this brief update about my project was interesting to read and that it inspired you to consider similar experimentations with the collections in your library. If you decided to try it, why not let me know? I’m @mdermentzi on Twitter. If you want to find out more about word embeddings, I highly recommend reading Chapter 6 of the (freely available) book “Speech and language processing” by Jurafsky and Martin or watch Manning’s lecture on “Word Vector Representations: word2vec” on YouTube. For an interesting read on meaning and how much of it machines are able to “understand,” check out the paper “Climbing towards NLU: On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data” by Bender and Koller.

Introduction to Digital Humanities | edX,"Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. As primary sources of information are more frequently digitized and available online than ever before, how can we use those sources to ask new questions? How did Chinese families organize themselves and their landscapes in China’s past? How did African slaves from different cultures form communities in the Americas? What influences informed the creation and evolution of Broadway musicals? How can I understand or interpret 1,000 books all at once? How can I create a visualization that my students can interact with? The answers to these questions can be explored using a wide variety of digital tools, methods, and sources.  As museums, libraries, archives and other institutions have digitized collections and artifacts, new tools and standards have been developed that turn those materials into machine-readable data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for example, have enabled humanities researchers to processvastamounts of textual data. However, these advances are not limited just to text. Sound, images, and video have all been subject to these new forms of research.  This course will show you how to manage the many aspects of digital humanities research and scholarship. Whether you are a student or scholar, librarian or archivist, museum curator or public historian — or just plain curious — this course will help you bring your area of study or interest to new life using digital tools.

Introduction to TEI for scholarly texts | School of Advanced Study,"Textual scholars and other philologists who want to learn about digital methods in their field for editing and publishing texts, may find this introductory workshop useful.

This short workshop will introduce the use of TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML for marking up literary and historical texts and critical editions. Delivered via a mix of asynchronous video tutorials and brief live sessions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we will offer basic instruction in encoding text editions in TEI using a standard XML editor. Participants will be able to choose between a couple of models of TEI usage (including EpiDoc for ancient texts, and modern multi-genre manuscripts), and have the opportunity practice the skills learned on their own texts (or some sample texts provided) and ask for help and feedback throughout the workshop as required. No prior experience in XML or coding is expected.

By the end of the workshop, students will have a working familiarity with TEI structures and vocabularies, and be able to articulate what models might be appropriate for specific editions. Live sessions will be held from 2.00 - 3.00pm BST on Monday 17 May, Wednesday 19 May and Friday 21 May. Fees Tutors © School of Advanced Study 2020

Published online by Cambridge University Press: 
22 April 2021 As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities in a broad sense. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archive collections to support digital pedagogy. Related activities of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA), its Digital Humanities SIG and the ARLIS/NA in the Humanities Commons are also discussed.  As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities (DH) in a broad sense. New art information professionals are expected to conversant with digital humanities.Footnote 1 A proliferation of digital projects created by art and architecture librarians reflects this, as do the position titles of art information professionals, the number of art libraries participating in inter-institutional digital GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) initiatives and the publications produced by the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA). The Society's digital humanities initiatives are not exclusive to its special interest group dedicated to digital humanities, the DH SIG, now nearly a decade old.Footnote 2 Members of many groups, sections, and divisions across ARLIS/NA spearhead and contribute to DH projects, with the collaborative underpinning of digital humanities supporting inter-institutional engagement and innovation. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archives collections to support digital pedagogy.  The Humanities Commons is a platform for open information sharing in the Humanities. Based on the open-source Commons in a Box software, the Humanities Commons began as a project of the Modern Language Association (MLA) and is now maintained by Michigan State University.Footnote 3 In 2018, the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons Planning Task Force recommended that the society adopt Humanities Commons as a “network for facilitating communication and collaboration between members of scholarly communities.”Footnote 4 Subsequently, an Implementation Task Force was formed to develop a branded portal for ARLIS/NA on the Humanities Commons. ARLIS/NA is expected to join the MLA, the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES), the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) and the College Art Association (CAA), on the platform as a participating organization later this year. A dedicated area for ARLIS/NA members and ARLIS/NA publications will encourage engagement both within and across organizations and disciplines in the Humanities. Two projects, A Digital Humanities Bibliography and the Digital Art History Directory, demonstrate the promise of the Commons.  A Digital Humanities Bibliography was recently deposited in CORE, the Humanities Commons shared repository. CORE provides a permanent URL with digital object identifier (DOI), subject and keyword tagging and a download count. In three months there were 235 downloads of the DH Bibliography, which includes 1500 citations, organized alphabetically, on topics including but not limited to the arts.Footnote 5 Documents in the CORE repository can be affiliated with multiple groups (such as Digital Art History and Digital Humanists) as well as a particular organization (such as the upcoming ARLIS/NA Commons) to improve discoverability. The traditional bibliography, even for a newer topic like Digital Humanities, remains a useful tool, and enjoys a wider audience and persistent access in the shared repository.  In addition to structured, open access to publications, it is possible to develop custom projects on the Humanities Commons. The ARLIS/NA Commons will soon feature the Digital Art History Directory (DAHD), a project led by Michelle Wilson, Samantha Deutch and Roger Lawson and supported by the ARLIS/NA Cataloging Section, Digital Humanities SIG, Web Archiving SIG and Systems Librarian Working Group. The DAHD is a dynamic resource “for discovering, sharing and researching digital art history (DAH) projects. The DAHD is intended to be the largest, most comprehensive and inclusive collection of information on digital art history and to function as a tool and living resource, rather than a static publication.”Footnote 6 Projects submitted for inclusion, which may range from best practices to data sources to digital projects and bibliographies, will undergo a review process prior to publication. A well-designed, user-friendly interface, along with a locally created taxonomy for project types, and subject and keyword searching make the directory an indispensable resource for discovering digital art history. In the deluge of digital information, this project again underscores the place of traditional library work, such as compiling bibliographies, directories and indices, in the digital age. Here changes in technology do not usurp the bibliographer's role; rather they permit bibliographers to facilitate access to non-traditional resources, often not published commercially and not indexed in subscription databases.  The flexible platform of the Humanities Commons, which is built on WordPress, hosts initiatives of different scales, ranging from a single document to the interactive directory discussed above, as well as a group organizing space. The DH SIG will begin its transition to the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons soon after launch by migrating its WordPress website. With shared interests and an informal organizational structure, the DH SIG provides a welcoming place for members exploring digital humanities for the first time, for discovering useful tools and projects and to incubate ideas and collaborations. The DH SIG plans to adopt communication channels available in the Commons including a calendar, social networking features and collaborative document and file sharing. The centralized tools will improve connection between members, streamline the wide variety of communication outlets employed intermittently over the last decade and allow members to publicize their projects on the platform where they are hosted.  Another initiative where a wide variety of organizations and librarians in many roles, including art librarians, have come together is Wikidata, the linked data repository behind Wikipedia and other Wikimedia initiatives. The Wikidata Pilot Project of the Program for Cooperative Cataloguing (PCC) explores identity management through Wikidata. Participating libraries meet monthly for training and discussion of Wikidata or linked data topics. Libraries who have joined the PCC Wikidata Pilot with projects focused on art-related linked data include the Frick Art Reference Library, Michigan State University, the National Gallery of Art, the New Mexico State Library, New York University, Northwestern University, Oklahoma State University, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Smithsonian. Linked data will be created on topics including artists, specifically, from Black, Latinx and Native American communities; artists’ files; art historians/historiography; works of art, including portraits, manga, and campus public art and architecture; archival and special collections; art materials; exhibitions; and government publications.Footnote 7  It is not necessary to participate in the PCC Wikidata Pilot Project to work with Wikidata or linked data. Vanderbilt University and the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, have developed their own projects to share metadata from art museum collections with Wikidata.Footnote 8 Another pilot project exploring bulk transformation of structured data from ContentDM into linked data is OCLC's “Transforming Metadata into Linked Data.” The project report confirms the value of linked data for discovery and visualization, but also notes the difficulties of reconciling data without some manual input and the long-term timeline for the shift to linked data.Footnote 9 Awareness of these linked data projects is important even for librarians who do not catalogue or otherwise create datasets. Once in Wikidata, this data may be used for visualizations, textual analysis or provide access to public domain images useful to art researchers. There will be opportunities to learn about linked data at the ARLIS/NA 49th Annual Conference, which will feature a presentation on linked data from the Frick Art Reference Library and the National Gallery as well as a workshop for beginners, Wikidata for Art Librarians, hosted by the DH SIG and conducted by Will Kent of the Wikimedia Foundation.  The rich data available in Wikidata populates network visualizations and informs a variety of other DH projects. Additionally, conversations about representing communities and languages in linked data and the critical approaches necessary to describe them equitably align with interdisciplinary humanities inquiry. DH visualizations provide an avenue for communicating the complex contextuality of these issues to a wider audience.Footnote 10  Wikidata connects data creators with one of the widest audiences available – users of Wikipedia. Names of artists, works of art, exhibitions, and publications, can supplement and support contributions to Wikipedia. For example, the “info boxes” or “knowledge panels” displayed in both Wikipedia and Google searches display data from Wikidata.Footnote 11 Adding exhibition histories and citations to Wikidata can help establish artists from marginalized communities as “notable” for inclusion in Wikipedia.Footnote 12 ARLIS/NA members have been active as Wikipedia editors, not only in the DH SIG, but across the organization. Recent edit-a-thons for the Art + Feminism Wikipedia group have included the National Museum Women in the Arts Library focusing on women artists of color; Respect Her Crank: A Go-Go Herstory Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon from the Smithsonian Libraries; The Walker Art Center editing articles of womxn artists in the Walker's exhibition Don't let this be easy, among many others. Additionally, Yale and MIT Libraries held the BIPOC in the Built virtual Wikipedia edit-a-thon, a week-long event to create Wikipedia pages for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) artists, architects and designers. No experience is needed to participate in a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and extensive guidance on organizing a local event is available from Art + Feminism and Wikimedia.Footnote 13  Digital skill building meets visual literacy in Building Visual Literacy: A Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Teaching from University Art Collections. Created by Washington and Lee University's University Collection of Art and Art History in partnership with the University Library, these object-based lesson plans “cultivate visual literacy abilities to interpret and evaluate the world around us—important tools for student success in any discipline or career field.”Footnote 14 Photogrammetry of Uncle Tom's Cabin Vase, one of the toolkit lessons, offers a user-friendly overview of this technique for creating a three-dimensional model of a ceramic vase, paired with suggestions for teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Similarly, a Drew University librarian Danielle Reay developed a three-dimensional model to teach visual literacy skills. Using historic documents from the university archives, Reay virtually reconstructed a demolished library building for a research skill building exercise for architecture students.Footnote 15  Since over the past months it has not been possible to travel for museum fieldtrips or the site visits integral to the architecture studio, virtual reality may be evolving from interesting technology into technological necessity. A pilot project at the Frances Loeb Library of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design supported virtual site visits for architecture students in two studio courses. Despite the short turnaround time for the project, site documentation, including videos, was collected for reuse in future courses through the library collections portal.Footnote 16 In this way, DH enhanced the traditional library role of collection development and efficient access to resources. The University of Calgary developed a virtual reality (VR) artist in residence program for art and architecture students. It is an innovative combination of a badge program and a residency. Students receive training, access to VR equipment and applications and other support needed to deliver a shareable VR project by the end of the residency.Footnote 17  Additionally, several three-dimensional collections have been digitized in two dimensions for the first time. The ARLIS/NA 2020 conference presentation Reimagining Unique Collections through Digitization highlighted an 1893 World's Fair panorama captured in glass lantern slides at the University of Kansas, textiles and garments from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Textile Resource Center collection, and fiber arts artist files from The Friends of Fiber Art International Artist File Collection of the American Craft Council.Footnote 18 The Frances Loeb Library and the Rhode Island School of Design Fleet Library launched Material Order Search, a shared digital library of design materials. Robust search and browse features are built on a custom taxonomy for materials that includes production company, usage, composition, and sensorial properties, for example, “touch - rough” to describe the tactile sensation of a particular texture.Footnote 19  Traditional digital collections of visual resources centers and archives are being reimagined as digital humanities projects in increasingly creative ways. The Yale Arts Library brought a traditional art history visual resources collection into more than a thousand dimensions with PixPlot.Footnote 20 PixPlot visualizes a complex neural network using common three-dimensional game design techniques. The result is a highly interactive visualization tool that helps users see connections between objects in new ways. Images from the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale Center for British Art and the Medical Historical Library have also been visualized in PixPlot.  IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is the image display and sharing technology behind many recent innovative visual digital humanities projects, including PixPlot.Footnote 21 Several recent IIIF applications from the Getty Research Center stand out: 12 Sunsets, the Research Collections Viewer and the Animal Crossing Art Generator. 12 Sunsets visualizes more than 60,000 of Ed Ruscha's Sunset Strip photographs. Website visitors maneuver Ruscha's pickup truck along Sunset Boulevard or search by year, time of day, street, tag or keyword to explore the photographs. The Research Collections Viewer provides a more traditional archival view of the same collection and several others. The simple interface contains a novel visualization of the collection hierarchy as well as metadata, permissions, the image comparison viewer, and IIIF manifests. The Animal Crossing Art Generator takes artworks out of the museum—The Getty or any museum that provides IIIF images—and into a popular game by Nintendo called Animal Crossing.Footnote 22 Players find a IIIF manifest URL, paste it into a form on the Getty site to generate a QR code, which will download the artwork onto a wall or an easel inside the game.Footnote 23  In addition to the novel applications noted above, IIIF may be used for traditional art historical image comparison within a single collection as well as across institutions. At the Henry E. Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, Mario Einaudi trains schoolteachers to use ContentDM with IIIF and Mirador to provide dynamic presentations in the classroom. For example, a zoomable map of Chinatown may be contextualized with a detail of a neighborhood as well as historical maps, street views, photographs or objects simultaneously.Footnote 24  As the foundation of many digital humanities projects, digitized collections are included in this overview of recent digital humanities initiatives alongside innovative approaches to manipulating digitized images in the humanities. Despite established workflows and technological advances that have made digitization efforts and digital exhibitions routine, many barriers remain, and many collections are not yet digitized. The authors of Reimagining Unique Collections mention challenges such as communication with vendors; rights clearance; and ongoing server and site maintenance. Digital preservation remains perpetually on the horizon. As Meghan Lyon has observed in her assessment of digitized artists’ archives, “challenges include providing access to an intelligibly navigable and publicly engaging platform; maintaining cohesion, context, and credibility; balancing copyright, privacy, and access; and facilitating cross-institutional collaboration.”Footnote 25  Many digitization projects are noteworthy simply as unique digital surrogates, and many have overcome significant impediments, often without a budget. In this sense, small-scale projects brought to fruition merit recognition alongside more innovative, programmatic approaches to digital humanities in the arts. During the last year as courses moved online and museum capacities were reduced, many digital projects were created, and this overview covers only a very small percentage of DH work in libraries. Employees and resources were reallocated from other departments to create metadata or transcriptions for digital collections remotely. Even with pandemic delays, it became apparent that a great deal could be accomplished under extraordinary circumstances with a relatively small shift in focus.  Another urgent shift, unrelated to the pandemic, is happening. The Maryland Institute Black Archives (MIBA) or Blackives project, by student Deyane Moses, provides some of the clearest evidence that despite the vast number of digital collections, digital humanities projects and digital archives created in art libraries and museums, there are many stories that have not been told.Footnote 26 MIBA documents the Black experience at the College from its beginning in 1892, to a 1935 exhibition on lynching, to 1954, when admission was opened up to students of color, through to the present day. In a 2016 conversation with the LA Review of Books, Jessica Marie Johnson reflected, “DH has offered people the means and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far as I'm concerned….If there isn't a place for this type of work within what we are talking about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty conversation.”Footnote 27 It is vital for art information professionals who create data from collections, develop state-of-the-art interoperability across systems and press forward with new digital tools, to take the time to look backward, to discover gaps in collections and to support colleagues and communities in efforts to rebuild their own histories through digital humanities.  The digital humanities have enabled art libraries to extend the reach of many traditional functions such as collection building and development, bibliographic instruction, providing access to unique materials and original cataloguing in support of art and architecture fields. Collections now house multimodal representations of architectural sites and digital assets in many dimensions. Instruction covers digital techniques such as photogrammetry and visual literacy not only for art and architecture, but across disciplines. Name authorities are being linked in a truly global database, Wikidata, and bibliographies such as the Digital Art History Directory help patrons sort through an abundance of digital art historical projects in a few clicks. The ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons will provide an opportunity to carry out the professional work of art libraries in a truly collaborative fashion. Upcoming projects from ARLIS/NA members include visualization services; digital privacy; crowdsourcing data; art faculty data and research impact assessment; digital accessibility; digital project preservation; digital publishing and open educational resources (OER); multimodal storytelling; virtual reality artist residencies; and oral histories, to name a few — as art librarians continue to increase engagement with their collections through the digital humanities. 1.

Call for Fellows: Data Visualizations Using the D’Argenio Collection – Special Collections & The Gallery,"Special Collections & The Gallery Seton Hall University – University Libraries (Fall 2021) Application Deadline: July 15, 2021 Fellowship Period: Fall 2021 Background Seton Hall University Libraries support excellence in academic and individual work, enable inquiry, foster intellectual and ethical integrity and respect for diverse points of view through user-focused services and robust collections as the intellectual and cultural heart of the University.  Walsh Gallery, based in the Library, manages the University’s museum collections, and the Library’s Data Services division assists the University community in managing and presenting their data. One of Seton Hall University’s most distinguished collections, the D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities, includes coins of ancient Greece, the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and Byzantium as well as a small collection of related Byzantine and Etruscan artifacts: oil lamps, game pieces, weights and terra cotta figurines. Donor Ron D’Argenio became interested in ancient coins when taking courses in Greek drama and history as an undergraduate at Fordham University in the 1970’s. In 2001, he generously donated his collection to Seton Hall University in memory of his father, Rinaldo J. D’Argenio, who served in World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for his valor. Ron D’Argenio is a practicing attorney working in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The collection is available for study and research by students and scholars. Data Services offers consultations to SHU community members assisting them with every stage of a data project from conceptualization, to choosing tools, to data analysis, to sharing results.  Find more on the tools supported here: https://library.shu.edu/data-services. Request for Proposals The University Libraries seeks fellowship proposals using the Ron D’Argenio Collection as the basis for projects in the following two areas: Specialists who have at minimum completed all coursework for the the terminal degree in their area are invited to propose research projects that fall under one or both of the above areas. Preference will go to the strongest applications that are both feasible for this collection and our technology infrastructure. All projects should incorporate the Ron D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities.  The final product for the Classics/Art History/History scholar would take the form of a short (5-7 page) written report interpreting the collection which would additionally be shared with the University community as an article or lecture.  The Data Visualization scholar would be responsible for producing a data visualization project which would be publicly presented on the University Libraries website and the process of creation described in an article or lecture.  Beyond the duration of the fellowship, the work of both fellows will inform future initiatives with the collection. You can view a small portion of the Ron D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities on our Google Arts and Culture page or you may make a research appointment to gather additional data and/or view the collection by contacting us at walshgallery@shu.edu or 973-275-2033. Terms/Eligibility for Fellowships Scholars who at minimum have completed all coursework for the terminal degree in their field may apply.  Work can be performed remotely for the most part.  Access to the collections on site is conducted in a socially distanced environment compliant with all recommendations aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.  The University Libraries will provide each fellow with access to its library databases and resources, accounts in and support for the data software available, an email address and access to Microsoft Teams software for collaboration and Sharepoint for storage space.  Fellows will be expected to give a presentation or write an article on their project to share with the University community by the fall of 2022. Fellows will be paid a stipend of $2500 for projects that focus on one of the two areas.  Half will be paid on award, half on project completion.  Applicants may propose a project that incorporates both Classical scholarship and data visualization for a combined $5000 to be disbursed in the same way. Procedures Submit a single pdf including the following components as an email attachment to library@shu.edu : Notifications Submissions must be received by July 15, 2021.  Applicants will be notified by September 1, 2021.  Research should take place in the fall of 2021, and the project results (written work or data visualization) completed by May 31, 2022.  The lecture or article on the project should take place in the spring or fall of 2022.  Please contact Sarah Ponichtera, Assistant Dean of Special Collections and the Gallery at sarah.ponichtera@shu .edu with any questions.",http://ow.ly/oN5B50ExDl3

 Apr 28 Wed, 28 April 2021 16:30 – 18:00 BST Online event Digital Humanities communities claim to wish to be inclusive and just, notably in relation to gender, race and sexuality. In relation to gender these aspirations have recently been articulated in terms of intersectional feminism, the latter often taken for granted and adopted – as the ‘right’ way to think about gender and technology relations and as the ‘right’ way to do them (DH in theory, DH in practice, or as a research field). This paper sets out to re-consider intersectional feminism, and its widespread adoption as a naturalized starting position from which to develop feminist work within DH. It engages with other traditions that have theorized relations between overlapping forms of discrimination in systemic terms and that have done so in relation to the technology/gender relation – notably various historical materialist feminisms, and explores the implications of critical race theory writing engaging with intersectionality and/as recuperation for DH work and thinking. The third section of the paper suggests that asking what forms of feminism can productively operate within DH also entails asking where feminisms engaging with intersecting forms of discrimination are operational; in what layer of the stack, at what moment in the pipeline, in relation to which materials? It concludes by arguing for full stack feminism.  Caroline Bassett researches, teaches, and writes about digital technologies and cultural change. She is Director of Cambridge Digital Humanites (CDH), an inter-disciplinary research hub. Current research projects include co-leading IFTe, an AHRC and Irish Research Council network exploring gender, technology and Digital Humanities.

			Part of the
			Digital Humanities Summer Institute : Technologies East 2021
			(known as DHSITE)   Increasingly DH researchers have greater access to funding to support large-scale multi-partner projects with diverse digital assets. A lack of formal training opportunities for data curation in multi-site DH teams means that the data produced in these teams is in danger of being lost! This workshop is a good preparation for researchers who must create a data management plan to comply with funding agency requirements. This workshop will cover all areas of data management including: IP permissions and informed consent, data collection, metadata standards, file sharing, preservation (data deposit), and data sharing through the open data spectrum of access. Participants will work on their own data curation challenges in break-out sessions and with reference to case study examples presented by a panel of DH scholars and digital asset management specialists:
• Constance Crompton (University of Ottawa),
• Karis Shearer (University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus),
• Matthew Lincoln (Carnegie Mellon University),
• Mikhel Proulx (Concordia University and Indigenous Digital Art Archive) Download recording (.mov)

	During the Cold War, many Princetonians feared a nuclear bomb being dropped by the Soviets on NYC or Philadelphia. Princeton contemplated whether they should construct nuclear fallout shelters to protect their students and Princeton community members in the event of nuclear fallout. 
 
	To address these questions, In September 1961 Princeton president Robert Goheen created the Committee on Fallout, composed of Princeton faculty, to investigate the benefits, disadvantages, and moral implications of constructing fallout shelters. This committee produced a preliminary report in January of 1962. The report identified buildings across campus that had the potential to serve as nuclear fallout shelters, developed plans for renovating these buildings to be appropriate shelters, estimated cost and time this project would take, and estimated the number of individuals these shelters could hold.
 
	Princeton professors were divided on the question of whether or not the University should construct fallout shelters. In the February 11, 1962 issue of the Princeton Town Topics, about 120 Princeton faculty and 68 Rutgers faculty published a letter endorsing President Kennedy's fallout program. Signatories included Princeton President Goheen and Physics Professors John Wheeler and Eugene Wigner. Proponents saw a need to adequately prepare for the event of a nuclear bomb being detonated over NYC or Philadelphia. A second letter signed by 100 faculty members who opposed the fallout program appeared in The Washington Post in late December 1961. Opponents saw fallout shelters as a waste of time, money, and resources. They argued, in addition, that fallout shelters are problematic because they increase the probability of nuclear war: they endorse methods of surviving the aftermath rather than preventing their detonation in the first place. 
 
	Questions also arose as to whether fallout shelters constructed by Princeton should be for Princeton students and faculty only, or if they should be available for Princeton community members, as well. In February 1962, the Committee on Fallout recommended that “any shelter space to be available to anyone at all on a first come-first served basis.” This led to the expansion of shelters to more locations within the surrounding Princeton community. Thirty more locations around the town of Princeton were refurbished and stocked to serve as nuclear fallout shelters for the community.
 
	The fallout shelters were stocked with food, water and sanitation, medical and radiological kits. They were clearly marked as nuclear fallout shelters on the outside of the buildings. In 1962, Congress allocated $169 million for development of nuclear shelters. This money helped fund Princeton’s fallout shelters. On each dormitory door, in the same way that fire emergency exit plans are pasted on doors, there were procedures for nuclear attacks which read “https:/nuclearprinceton.princeton.edu/missing-fallout-shelters.”
 
	Just ten years after the construction of these nuclear fallout shelters, they had been essentially forgotten. In 1973, undergraduate Ronald Mann ‘76 noticed the nuclear fallout procedure signs on his dormitory door and contacted the Division of Fire Safety (DFS) to locate the nearest shelter. DFS was unaware of both the shelter’s location and the signs posted on the doors. 
 
Locations on Princeton’s campus that were ultimately renovated and equipped to serve as nuclear fallout shelters in 1963 included Madison Hall, Holder Hall, Hamilton Hall, Laughlin Hall, Dillon Gymnasium, McCarter Theatre, Firestone Library, McCosh Hall, Frick Chemistry Laboratory, Green Hall, Dickinson Hall, Wilcox Hall, 1915 Dormitory, 1938 Dormitory, Guyot Hall, Palmer Laboratory, Dodge-Osborn Hall, the Engineering Quadrangle, the Graduate College, and the Forrestal Research Center. Princeton Theological Seminary buildings included Speer Library, Campus Center, Tennent Hall, North Hall and Symington House.
 
	Buildings in the Princeton community included Princeton High School, Nassau Street Elementary School, St. Pauls School, Miss Mason's School, Hun School, Columbus Boychoir School, First Presbyterian Church, Second Presbyterian Church, Aquinas Foundation, Our Lady of Princeton, Post Office, Township Hall, Textile Research Institute. Princeton University Press, Van Nostrand Company, 20 Nassau Street, Peacock Inn, the YMYWCA, and University Cottage Club. 
 
	These buildings have since been renovated and converted. Fallout materials have been removed, and they no longer serve as fallout shelters.",https://nuclearprinceton.princeton.edu/princetons-nuclear-fallout-shelters

 May 12 Wed, 12 May 2021 14:30 – 16:30 BST Online event The PRG Studio of the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media at Birmingham City University invites you to join a series of three workshops that explore the potential of bringing, performing, and communicating research online. The past year has brought about changes we could hardly have predicted. With archives closed and research participants accessible only via video calls, much of the research in the humanities has been moved online at an unprecedented rate. While this has been a challenge for many projects and researchers have had to re-evaluate and reinvent their work, the rapid change has brought about a new interest in working online. Language is there everywhere, yet it strangely escapes us. That is bad news indeed, but the good news is that we can all become more careful users of language and perceptive speaker-listeners quite easily if we are told what to be on the lookout for. And this is exactly what this workshop is going to be about. The workshop will not give you the 5 tips for becoming ‘successful’ participants in a Zoom session, but it will provide a handy ‘tool box’ for self-analysis (when you speak) and active listenership (when others talk).   It will consider the following:  We will consider together how all these parameters might be handled to produce a ‘good impression’ (since this is what we are looking for, after all). During this Zoom session, participants will be given the opportunity to do simple exercises for vocal and postural training, based on poetry reading. It is hoped this will bring something new and exciting to you, something different from the (very useful) ‘role playing’ exercises you may have already done in other ‘professional communication’ workshops. Jean-Rémi Lapaire is a Professor in Cognitive Linguistics, Embodiment and Gesture Studies at the Université Bordeaux Montaigne. He has published widely in the fields of grammar, gesture, and cognition.

Day of DH 2021 | centerNet,"Back to Day of DH Main Page On this Page: Day of DH on Twitter | Planning for Day of DH at your Center | On April 29 and Events | Images and Zoom Backgrounds Day of DH 2021 will take place on April 29. The organizing committee this year is led by Loyola University Chicago and UCLA in USA, University of Guelph in Canada, and Università del Piedmont Orientale in Italy. Our theme this year is multilingual DH, and Digital Humanists from all corners of the world are encouraged to share their work not just on Twitter (as always!) but also Instagram, with the hashtag #dayofdh2021. We aim to open up conversation about projects being undertaken in the various languages and put together a list of non-English tools, libraries, software products, tips, hacks, and resources available for researchers and institutions. In the past, Centers have organized events or introduced new activities in their spaces as part of their Day of DH. This Day of DH comes after a year of living in the virtual space and for that, it is more special. We have had a year of seeing human life and technology intersect intimately, and seen its affordances and its limitations come to fore virtual meeting after virtual meeting. So #dayofdh2021 provides us with an opportunity to share and reflect upon how a global pandemic changed DH, its directions, your research questions, and more.
 Over the next few weeks, we will update the website with resources, suggested events to hold on your campus, and more. Keep an eye out, and for queries, please DM us on Twitter, or email us at luctsdh@luc.edu.  Day of DH will be using the Twitter hashtag #dayofdh2021. Day of DH will take place primarily on Twitter, a widely used and easily accessible platform for many. If you  or your center will be writing a blog post or sharing on some other medium, please tweet the URL of your blog post or web page. We will be collecting and archiving posts, and will try to harvest links as well. Please post about your work day, your plans and your daily activities. Day of DH is a way to show how digital humanities happens in many different ways, and is practiced by a varied group of people.    This year, we’ll collect the visual stories and images of the day with the shared hashtag #dayofdh2021. Show off your projects, visualizations, exhibits, or your work-from-home setup. You can also record a reel to share or set up a guide to DH related studies.
  Please share pictures as you share your day! We'd like to make sure that everyone can read and participate in the Day of DH Twitter activity. To that end, you are encouraged to add alt-text to images that you post. To do this, you have to turn on the ""Compose Image Description"" feature which is in the ""Accessibility"" tab in the ""Settings""  of your Twitter app. You will then see a ""Describe Image"" label that allows you to insert a short description of the contents of your image. This is then visible to screen readers and other accessibility software. For more detail, see the Twitter support instructions:  How to make images accessible for people or a video.  The @dayofdh Twitter and @dayofdh Instagram account will be providing news and updates. Following Day of DH on Twitter as it unfolds:   Universities, research centers, and places of work may still be closed for in-person gatherings. However, borrowing from last year, an institution, center, department, or group might host a virtual lecture, project presentation or stream a keynote lecture from the DH conference. Advertising this with the #dayofdh or #dayofdh2021 hashtag might bring many more attendees to your event than in our former, embodied times. You could also host a session of the Floating Meet-up.
 Follow the @dayofdh Twitter account for latest news.  Here are some event ideas you can put together for at your DH organisation:  Events will be listed here in the days/weeks to come, along with time zones. Join us in hearing lightening talks from our graduating MA students in Digital Humanities about their research capstone projects. Speakers will be: Friday, April 30, 2021, 12:00-2:00pm CST via University of Chicago Digital Forum. Note the date: this event falls on the day after Day of DH 2021.
To register, please visit the DH Forum website.  In her 2016 essay, “Making the Case for Black Digital Humanities,” Dr. Kim Gallon articulated a framework for how technology, employed in an “underexamined context” could further our understanding of a “racialized social construction” that shapes global society. Gallon’s call for black digital humanities has been manifested in DH projects that seek to recover, refine, and recontextualize race and culture questions. In this address, I will explore the manifestations of this Black DH ecosystem and articulate links between my own exploration of black speculative practice through real and imagined space as a manifestation of this Black DH framework. Julian C. Chambliss is Professor of English with an appointment in History and the Val Berryman Curator of History at the MSU Museum at Michigan State University. In addition, he is a co-director for the Department of English Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition Lab (DHLC) and a core participant in the MSU College of Arts & Letters’ Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR). His research interests focus on race, culture, and power in real and imagined spaces. An interdisciplinary scholar he has designed museum exhibitions, curated art shows, and created public history projects that trace community, ideology, and power in the United States. The Corr-Proust team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is working on transcribing and translating the collected letters of Marcel Proust, and the team behind it is working from three continents in two languages (so far, with the possibility for more as the translation wiki expands). They have put together a multilingual content management system and workflow organizer for less than $500, and the translation wiki is entirely free. They're happy to tell anyone who’s interested how they did it.
The team is holding open hours from 3:30 – 4:30 Central time on Thursday, April 29, and https://go.illinois.edu/CorrProustPresentations will have the Zoom information. Do join them! The Twitter stream will be harvested and the archive will be cleaned up and placed in one or more trusted repositories, such as Zenodo, as permitted.

 centerNet’s new publication, DHCommons, is merging with Arts-Humanities.net to create one large-scale discovery and review publication for digital humanities projects.   The Resources page lists talks, articles, sample DH proposals and other sources of information about ways to start and sustain DH centers. 
 A Day of the Life of the Digital Humanities, an event where digital humanists from around the world document what they do. If you think your center is a digital humanities center, in whole or in part, then we’d be glad to have you join centerNet. We leave the definition of “digital humanities” up to you, but we intend to be inclusive, and we know that there will be cross-over into the social sciences, media studies, digital arts, and other related areas. This might include humanities centers with a strong interest in or focus on digital platforms.  One caveat—a “center” should be larger than a single project, and it should have some history or promise of persistence.

Schedule,"This talk will examine the emerging areas of research in Digital Humanities in India by an examination of the term “Digital Humanities” and its uneven and uncertain trajectory in the Indian research ecosystem. As with other systems around the world, DH in India is complex and contextual and each of us involved in the disciplinary practice encounter resistance and skepticism.  Resistance to what is perceived as a deliberate distancing from the larger Humanities queries, scepticism about appropriating the rhetoric of STEM disciplines merely as a tool for greater legitimacy and validation. But of course DH is far more than a sum of its criticisms and scepticisms. I will address why it is imperative that the digital be harnessed, critiqued, deconstructed and dissected precisely so that the issues that Humanities scholars have been invested in continue to be at the centre of the development, deployment and dissemination of technology.   The Swedish Caribbean Colonialism 1784–1878 project (SweCarCol) integrates, orders and opens up important dispersed archives for research by publishing them on the Internet in cooperation with Uppsala University Library.      The paper describes and discusses a series of DH projects that have developed at CESTA and have addressed major issues in the history of the Atlantic World, including slavery and the experience of enslaved and freed persons in particular.   International, interdisciplinary spaces are inevitably sites of tension, where differences in linguistic and cultural norms run deeper than they initially appear. Establishing and maintaining a set of norms for a community to operate despite these differences requires ongoing dialogue within that community. This talk will reflect on language as one longstanding axis of diversity within digital humanities as it is carried out at the international level, as well as within different national contexts. This context will inform a frank discussion of the ways in which a general obliviousness towards languages commonly found in Anglophone countries has negatively impacted Anglophone scholars' research, pedagogy, and engagement with the broader field of DH. The talk will conclude with actionable steps that scholars, particularly in Anglophone countries, can take towards embracing language as an important axis of diversity.   While projects focused on Black culture, texts and artifacts are not as rare as they once were there remains a lack of understanding of the rich and deep histories of Black DH and its impact on the field. Sharon Leon’s foundation chapter, “Complicating a ‘Great Man’ Narrative of Digital History in the United States,” serves as a model of the necessary documentation that scholars must compile of alternative histories of digital humanities. Accordingly, this talk will document a deep dig into the ecology of digital humanities, centering Black DH work in the field. Among the scholars’ work discussed will be Abduhl Alkalimat, creator of e-black studies, Bryan Carter, Virtual Harlem, Marilyn Miller Thomas-Houston, iBlack Studies and co-editor of the multi-media journal Fire!!, Ronald Bailey, who developed www.dignubia.org and www.nubianet.org and Afro Publishing without Walls, and Maryemma Graham, History of Black writing. An ongoing project, I am conducting interviews with such foundational Black dh scholars to better understand their contributions to the field.  This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion we will broaden the question to digital humanities, and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalised in digital humanities discourse.  This talk has two parts. It will first attempt to frame what a history of digital history might look like, by focusing on hybridity as a key characteristic of historical research, seen as some form of integrating newly emerging tools, technologies, materials, and/or practices in historical research, and mapped and qualified according to the main phases of historical research. My main argument here is that, in order to ground our current ‘digital’ practices and learn from past experiences and expertise, we need an answer to the question: what were, and are, the continuities and ruptures in the use and uptake of new technologies in historical research, and in the debates that accompanied them?
		The paper will then proceed to outline what groundwork is necessary to explore digital history’s forgotten roots: a basic overview of the field’s different spatio-temporal trajectories and the networks of computing historians in the pre-PC and early PC period. A key focal point for such a reconstruction are the DH conferences that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, either as singular events or strands of bigger conferences such as the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Moscow in 1970, and later those that were organised under the aegis of the Association for History and Computing (AHC, 1987-2001) and its national member organisations. By studying which scholars attended and where they came from, and by linking that to the topics and methods that were discussed, it will be possible to chart, over time, shifting geographical, topical and methodological developments.
	In the second part of my paper, I will provide the first results of a concrete case study which is part of this broader endeavour, namely a web archaeology of the old AHC website and H-NET Discussion List for History and Computing (now: H-DigitalHistory).  The Digital Humanities have profoundly altered the way that humanities scholars work, research, and teach. While the introduction of computational methods, from GIS, to Digital Archives, to Text Mining, have opened up new fields to practitioners, these fields have also changed the social fabric of the humanities. Although the myth of the lone scholar, toiling away in their office, or in the archives, remains deeply embedded in the psyche of the discipline, the growing influence of the Digital Humanities has begun to offer scholars other opportunities for research work and teaching. Not only are our new methods collaborative by nature, they are often collaborative by necessity, frequently requiring us to work in teams that can leverage different experience and skills towards a set of research goals. In this talk, I want to explore the ramifications of this shift in research practice, focusing on the sociology of the humanities lab, as distinct from both the science laboratory, and the traditional practices of History, Classics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Literary Study. How has the collaborative nature of our work altered the kinds of research that we can produce? How has interdisciplinary cooperation challenged ideas of evidence, method and results in the humanities? How has the collaborative model of research changed our pedagogy? What new kinds of equality, and inequality, between faculty, staff and students, has this change enabled? And what does it mean to work collaborative in fields whose institutional structures persist in disincentivizing collaboration? Drawing on my own experience working at, and directing, the Stanford Literary Lab, an ongoing collaborative research group that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, I want to focus on the outstanding questions that we are only now beginning to address around this radical shift in the humanities.

DELVING INTO DIGITAL HUMANITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC: A VIEW IN RETROSPECT – Emile's World,"Emile's World 
			Discover yourself and learn about me		 Welcome to my second blog!  “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey” – Ralph Waldo Emerson (Goodreads). This quote clearly applies to our ENGL256B course: while we are constantly working on our multiple assignments, what matters is not only the final result, but rather the incredible experience we are getting while practicing the diverse Digital Humanities tools. This blog will shed light on our encounters as a group with the various DH tools as well as our methods of analysis during the Pandemic. The pandemic was a shock to the whole world which left close to everything on pause. Fortunately, after being in this situation for over a year now, we have learned to overcome the obstacles of distant learning. We are going to cover the good, the bad, the easy, the hard, the fun, and the more challenging aspects of learning how to use and interpret Digital Humanities tools from a distance.  First group meeting with my #ENGL256B colleagues! Got to know the team, and we jump-started the writing process. A great Final Project is on the way! @DoseofdH @TalaS_Eng256B @Jeffyammine914 pic.twitter.com/JUDgdYRLHX China has been using artificial intelligence and digital humanities to control and survey their population. Will the future of digital humanities interfere with our freedom for the sake of security?Check out this video and give me your opinion:@ENGL256Bhttps://t.co/O17Ga1eIR9 https://t.co/7j8i2MPSFd Sherlock Holmes: A Science-Based Detective! Indeed, Holmes used many forensic science tools to solve his various mysteries. In our #ENGL256B course, we are trying to clarify how these tools were used and how science is reflected in the books' linguistics. It’s crazy how everything is transferring to digital formats! As I get exposed to more articles like the one below, I wonder, how much information will people turn digital? #ENGL256B https://t.co/TMtdIP6pMV The most crucial part of a research whether it’s physical or digital is DATA ANALYSIS. Use Voyant tools for this task and check the review I found today! @ENGL256B #ENGL256B https://t.co/PeDUi22zGz The first DH tool we were exposed to was Twitter. It was something new to all of us. However, we can’t deny how much we enjoyed it. You can tweet anything that comes to mind. When we say anything, we literally mean ANYTHING! You can talk for example about launching your first website, about group gatherings you had, in-class or assignment-related activities, or more formal tweets sharing some articles you may have found online. Since the Digital Humanities field is so broad, we could either learn from others’ tweets or inform our followers about cool facts on this topic. Below are some examples of diverse tweets we made during the semester: Elio shared an interesting article on Sherlock Holmes, a man who relies on science to analyze his cases, and uses clues such as footprints, fingerprints, hand-written documents, and many more. Emile posted a video that raises the question about the future role of DH in invading people’s freedom in order to establish security, Tala tweeted an article about the conversion of any literal paper to podcasts and Jeffery stressed the importance of Voyant Tools in data analysis. You can view the tweets below and don’t forget to follow us 😉 On top of that, we learned about other groups’ projects and their views on diverse matters. If this doesn’t make you want to create a Twitter account, We don’t know what will!  here to check an interesting article about Twitter! Speaking about groups, you can’t imagine how challenging it was for us to meet. Each member was living in a different world. Tala lives on the West Coast of the US whereas Emile lives on the East Coast. That’s 3 hours’ difference between them. Jeffrey and myself both live in Lebanon, so you can notice the huge hours’ difference in time zones. Hence, we had to find a time which would suit all of us. Usually, we would meet at midnight EET (Eastern European Time) which would be the equivalent of 5:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) and 2:00pm PST (Pacific Standard Time). On top of that, working in groups through WebEx is sometimes frustrating, especially during the first few meetings. We are sure that most of you, if not all, would rather have physical meetings instead of online meetings. The work is much more productive and efficient when we can interact physically. As discussed in blog 1, online learning was challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic; not to mention the several electricity cuts and other logistical difficulties. However, when there’s a will, there’s a way! We did our best to overcome all these obstacles. We held around 3 meetings per week for every ENG 256B assignment. During our ENGL256B classes and group meetings, we had hands-on experience with many Digital Humanities tools throughout the semester. From Google My Maps to StoryMap JS, Palladio (for both mapping and network analysis), Topotext, Antconc, Voyant Tools and many others. Some were very user-friendly and easy to use while others were more complicated. This comes on two levels: the technical level – navigating the website and knowing where to upload our data, how to export it etc., and the analytical level – creating insightful conclusions from the different visualizations we got.  From a technical standpoint, we found Google My Maps to be quite hard to use. First, it requires exact coordinates, so a location as broad as a city cannot be easily represented. Unfortunately, locations in many of the Sherlock Holmes stories we worked on were broad / not very precise, so we had to filter our results to locations that could be correctly entered and that would yield some insight and conclusions. Moreover, to create a Google My Maps map, we had to create a spreadsheet in which our data would get reflected. The problem here was that a small mistake in the spreadsheet data entered would impact the presentation on the map. For example, if we entered the coordinates in the wrong format, we would get wrong locations on the map, and that would definitely affect our analysis. Another issue was that once a layer is inserted, we would not be able to edit it in case we wanted to add an entry, so we had to delete the layer, go back to the initial spreadsheet, and add/rectify the data. Furthermore, we did not find the aesthetics of Google My Maps to be as appealing as StoryMap JS. However, after watching some tutorials posted on our ENGL256B Moodle Page, and following the directions of our instructor, we were able to manage those difficulties, and create a very nice and insightful map to include in our final DH Project     The map we developed using Google My Maps. February 2021.   However, the most challenging part of any research project, especially a Digital Humanities one, is usually not the technical but rather the analytical part. As we mentioned earlier, any logistical difficulty could be resolved by watching some tutorials and following instructions; however, the analysis process varies between projects while mostly being unique to each topic. In fact, while we found the Voyant Tools website to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, we had a hard time choosing the terms and themes we wanted to focus on, and that is due to many factors. First, since we are working with thirty literary texts, finding a clear trend among such a large number of texts was not an easy task. Second, despite the automatically generated stopword list in the “Cirrus” tool, many of the words in our word cloud were not really significant. For example, while many of the most frequent words were similar in all the stories, there were always variations, especially in stories that have additional characters. For example, in this Cirrus cloud generated from “The Hound of the Baskerville”, we see names such as “Stapleton, Moor, Henry, Baskerville, Barrymore…”. Those refer to people or places that are specific to that novel, and are absent from other stories. As a result, these terms are not really relevant to our analysis of the role of Forensic Science in the Sherlock Holmes canon. So we had to add such words to the stopword list manually to create a meaningful Cirrus cloud.  Cirrus Cloud generated on Voyant Tools (The Hound of the Baskerville). April 2021.   Third, although we found some interesting trends that indicate the relative occurrence of some words throughout the novels, those were not always perfect. While this was expected since novelists rarely follow hard rules when writing, it somewhat impeded our analysis and made us reluctant to focus on the given terms. However, we finally managed to narrow down our analysis to some interesting trends that we plan to include in our final presentation. Finally, while concordances would definitely help us, the recurrence of some words was so high that we could not really give a correct representation of the context of these words in a limited time frame, and this pushed us to rely more on tools other than concordances. Another “obstacle” we faced was finding our digital data. Since many articles are not from trusted sources or not peer-reviewed, we couldn’t rely on them for our analysis. This task was more complex since we were not working on-campus, where librarians would assist and provide some trustful journals or articles to enable us to derive our data. However, thankfully an AUB librarian, Mrs. Nabila Shehabeddine was always there to help: she gave us a presentation on how to cite our sources, and taught us how to check if a certain article was peer-reviewed. She also contributed to the Master Spreadsheet in which all students entered their sources. This task was definitely valuable and one of the reasons we made it this far in the course. We also held many meetings with our course instructor to monitor if we were on the right path and to get constructive feedback about our work. We’ve covered the difficulties we had while using some DH tools, however not all tools were as hard and complicated, and some were much more rewarding than others. One of the most satisfying moments we had while working on our diverse assignments was the creation of our first network. Indeed, we found Palladio to be easy to use, and the resulting visualizations to be very meaningful. Here are some of the networks we generated using Palladio. Two networks we generated using Palladio. March 2021. In fact, we consider Network Analysis to be the most easily interpreted representation of a significant amount of data and interrelations. It can emphasize key components, inter-dependencies, and the relative importance of nodes all at once (Otte). Networks are also very aesthetically pleasing and can clarify ideas for visual learners. We really had a great time manipulating networks, cross-linking different sets of data as sources or targets, manipulating the size nodes, links, highlights to get very effective networks. This will probably be apparent in our Final DH Project, since we are leaning towards Network Analysis more than the other tools despite the fact that none of us had learned about or used it ebfore in another course. And while we first encountered this method of analysis in this Digital Humanities class, we soon found ourselves very comfortable manipulating it. Actually, all of us equally contributed to creating networks, and most importantly compiling the data from which we built those networks. On a side note, while creating our networks, we made a funny analogy: we compared the process of building networks to an iceberg: 90% of an iceberg is submerged so we can’t see it, which leaves only 10% of the iceberg apparent. Palladio Network analysis is a bit similar, since 90% of the work was put into creating the spreadsheet filled with our data, and this is not seen in the final result. Only actual networks will make it to the final presentation, and such represent 10% of the work. Overall, Palladio Network analysis was definitely the tool we all liked the most. One might wonder how ENGL256B – introduction to digital humanities is different compared to other courses! Like most English courses at the American University of Beirut, students from all majors lign up to register for the class. However, this is not the typical English course required by the university for one to take. In fact, it is rather one of the most desired classes at the University. Students are eager to register for it to learn and implement the newest digital technologies in their day-to-day life, and especially for their specific majors. Reflecting on the advancement of the digital world, the class tends to offer a variety of platforms that are very informative and practical to use, all with the purpose of enhancing the representation of information. Now one might think, is this what makes it so special? We will address the subject in more depth and show what makes it unique. Coming from different backgrounds, our team encompasses one Biology student, one Chemistry student, one Civil Engineering student, and one Economics student, thus making it a diverse and versatile group. This combination and diversity of students is only present in very few classes at AUB. With more than 60% of the course relying on constant teamwork, we had to conduct long meetings over Webex as previously mentioned, followed by daily checkups. This intensive yet interactive class requires one to deal with different minds and different approaches throughout the semester. As a team, we worked and kept building on what we learned in previous meetings to reach the different goals that we had specified at the beginning of every week. Since most of our team members come from a technical background, we were constantly busy looking at formulas, concepts, theoretical hypotheses, rules, calculations, variables we rarely apply in our daily life. During the course and after learning a new concept after every class, we would directly put our new knowledge to use by implementing the information we had just learned. When we signed up for ENGL256B with Dr Najla Jarkas, our professor had created the perfect environment for us to learn and create something for ourselves from the beginning. It all started with the building of a website of our own, an all-time objective of mine and of most students nowadays. We also created personal blogs and talked about our experience in the course. Today as we work as a team, we are writing our second blog and sharing with you the enhanced features of this course. In addition to this, stay tuned to our grand finale, our final project, to see the end-results of our teamwork. No matter how diverse and special our group is, we all came to a mutual agreement that what makes this course stand out from all other courses offered by the university, is this informal method of learning. We are constantly being introduced and taught about new tools and platforms. What is a better way to perform, execute, and get feedback on your work? The concept that this course employs “it is never too late to improve your work” pushes you over the limit and allows you to perform and learn from your mistakes, with the objective of creating a better version of yourself! Expectations versus Reality Being fortunate enough to have taken this course, we also didn’t really know what to expect. Yes, you can get feedback from other students about certain courses but some courses you should personally experience. We heard only positive feedback about this course and we were super excited to delve into the learning outcomes of the course. Seeing as this course is an elective course, we weren’t really sure what to expect. However, the very elaborate explanations of our instructor, Dr. Najla Jarkas, never left us confused. We expected a basic introduction to the digital humanities field and possibly even picking up some tools we can use in other courses. Nonetheless, this course has given us way more than that! When we initially listened to the explanation of the syllabus and what we will be covering throughout the semester, we felt a bit overwhelmed. Thankfully, our teacher assured us that everything will be clearly explained and we will always have our class’s Moodle page to refer back to in case we feel lost. This is not to mention the constant help and support from the teacher herself either during class, after class, or during her office hours. The amount of support through consistently updating the documents on Moodle and allowing us to learn from our mistakes and improve our work is unmatched by any teacher we have ever had. Expectation vs Reality, 2020. We are near the end of this course, and we can confidently say that we now possess skills that will not only aid us in our other university courses, but also in the workplace and in our everyday lives. The various tools utilized throughout the course were all very beneficial to us seeing as the majority of our group are visual learners and the path to the completion of our project became clearer as we overcame each assignment on a weekly basis. The journey was not easy, but the result will definitely be worth it. Stay tuned for our third blog in which we will reflect on the whole process of creating our Final DH Project!

Digital Humanities - Complexities of Digital Humanities Tools During Times of Crisis,"Mohamad Sweidan                                    April 16th, 2021 When it comes to the concept of digital humanities, we can all express our novelty to this field that combines both technology and literature. Despite us falling into the category lucky enough to call ourselves “digitally literate” due to our previous experiences and knowledge in most of the requirements of this field, yet, the terms of their usage and the ways by which we were required to integrate our knowledge into this course has been completely new. As a group, we have all used Twitter as a social media application before, often going onto that platform to share our thoughts through tweets, or maybe just follow people we are interested in, and have also found ourselves people of interest for others to follow us and interact with us as well. Still, none of us ever thought they’d be using this website to engage in analysis of some literature of our choosing, posting our takes on some ideas, or tweeting our data and findings for other digital humanities students to view and comment on. We never thought we would be inducted into the digital humanities community on Twitter and actually focus our thoughts and posted content on this narrow topic that we had limited information about.  A little backstory about my personal experience with Twitter I have had my personal accounts wrongfully suspended 5 times by Twitter for violating policy. But I was finally able to get back my original account unsuspended, hence the handle @MoeThe6th.  Figure 1. My personal  Twitter profile, showing some of my interests, that I created back in August 2014. Similarly, we have all used Google Maps in our travels, looking for places that we do not know about their exact locations or navigating ourselves in places we are not very familiar with. And for those of us who have not been users of this application, we are at least familiar with the concept of an online map that pinpoints precise locations of practically every corner around the globe. Yet, we also find ourselves baffled at the idea of us creating a map of our own, following into the footsteps of some character from a fictional book we read. However, working on our own version of a map and uploading our data and information in the form of markers, pictures and coordinates into a map of our choosing was a project we enjoyed to the fullest extent in our group. Luckily for me, we had the chance to work on mapping some of the locations in The Da Vinci Code (2003), along with the key locations in life of the author and my favorite writer, Dan Brown.  Figure 2. Map representing some milestones of Dan Brown's life and most important locations in one of his books, The Da Vinci Code (2003). The same can be said about other digital humanities tools, and even more can be expressed about the tools that we were completely unfamiliar with and have only discovered during our journey in this course. When weighing the benefits of digital humanities tools, we must consider how they have massively helped us by presenting and interlinking digitized texts, images, and time-based media within maps, timelines and visualizations helping us to see more, experience more and collaborate together on this project we have chosen (Gubert, 2016). On the other hand, we cannot deny that we have struggled with some aspects of the course as well that we will go over in this blog.  Keep up-to-date with my latest tweets about Digital Humanities by checking the above Twitter feed. When it comes to Twitter, I think the greatest tussle would have to be coming up with original and informative tweets to share with the audience of our followers. It is easy to run a personal account and tweet the first thing that pops up into your mind, and most of the time your tweets don’t even have to make sense to anyone but you. But when there are certain etiquette you have to follow to make up a tweet, and when you are addressing a specific population in an effort to present useful information, there’s only so much you can tweet. For this reason, keeping up with the required number of tweets proved to be a bit more difficult than any of us imagined it would be. Another issue we encountered with Twitter was being able to integrate ourselves into the digital humanities community on the platform. However, over the course of the semester and as we began to participate in discussions among ourselves and with other classmates or students from other sections regarding the analysis of tools and their usage, we came to the realization that we, ourselves, have become the digital humanities community that we so longed to be a part of.  For the sake of organization and for meeting course requirements with ease, I created a different Twitter account, @MoeENGL256B (my 7th on that platform!) and dedicated it to Digital Humanities, tweeting mostly through the hashtag #ENGL256B. Figure 3. Comparison between my Twitter activity on my personal account vs. my new Digital Humanities account. Another simple aspect we found ourselves entangled in during this semester was the ability to attend and participate in online classes on a regular basis. As senior students, our responsibilities have grown larger, and our requirements have gone even further allowing us but little time to achieve the perfect attendance and participation score we all strive for in this course and in any other course. Unfortunately, due to the current situation in Lebanon and the limitations posed on even the most basic of resources such as electricity and the Internet, maintaining that attendance record proved to be challenging. Furthermore, with the current lockdown state we are in due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our inability to attend and practice these digital humanities tools on campus and in our prestigious computer labs under the supervision of our instructor, gaining as much as we can through online education proved to be a hassle during this pandemic that proved to be much more than just a health crisis (Burgess, 2020). Luckily for us, and with the provision of all course materials online, we were always capable of catching up and staying up-to-date with our assignments, deadlines and course content. Considering that digital humanities is mostly online, and the tools we learned about can all be accessed freely on certain websites, this allowed us to experiment with these tools and apply our gained knowledge through them at our own pace and in our own time.  In our journey with the course, we had the courtesy to explore different online digital tools. Many of these tools were new to us, but with the discussions and explanation from Dr. Jarkas, we are now able to use them in our analysis and build of our final digital project. The tools were very helpful in understanding our selected books and using them to build on the project. To be honest, not all the team members read the books of Dan Brown that entailed the journey of Robert Langdon. However, by applying distant reading and using these tools, we were able to understand the books and explain the intended topic which is the portrayal of good versus evil in five of Dan Brown's books. As will be discussed later in the blog, Voyant was the best tool we found relevant in displaying the analysis due to several features provided by this online digital tool. On the contrary, we found that AntConc was a bit complex and required some additional work. We mostly relied on Voyant and not AntConc because the last provides fewer features in terms of analysis and visualization of the uploaded corpus. One of the difficulties we faced when using AntConc was the need to have our searched terms in table forms. We need those forms to have an idea about the frequency of the most used terms in our analysis of the corpus. The other difficulty was having detailed statistics related to our analysis of the corpus and search results since AntConc lacks this feature which Voyant has. However, the main reason we used it was its easy feature of having the option of copying and pasting the results into a spreadsheet that would be useful for our project. Since we had some difficulties working with the program, yet needing it in our analysis, we had to put more effort to understand how it works. Thanks to Dr. Jarkas who uploaded several tutorials on Moodle, our online education portal, regarding the work on AntConc starting from the basic features and getting to know how to use the concordance tool. The uploaded tutorials included a link to a YouTube video provided by Laurence Anthony, a freeware concordance software program for Windows.  Anthony’s YouTube channel helped us a lot to overcome our difficulty with using AntConc. The YouTube channel contained a lot of videos explaining how to use the software. The steps were very clear, and one of the things we learned when watching the video for example is that  a user clicks on any search term in the KWIC (keyword in context) results will automatically display and open in the view files tool and the results could be either displayed in columns or hidden depending on the user preference in the intended analysis. Even though we faced some technical difficulties while working with the software, we must say that the tool was extremely effective in our analysis of the corpus. It was low-key fun working with this tool especially when we had the group meeting and read the guide together. Seeing each other’s trial and error when using it was very funny and at the same time helpful to complete the project. Check out the 1st tutorial about getting started on AntConc by clicking on the adjacent video. Figure 4. AntConc relates the word power frequently to the church in The Da Vinci Code (2003) and virus to a form of unethical Bio Terrorism in Inferno (2013).  When it comes to the question of the most exciting tool we used, the answer has to be Voyant. It is a free web-based text reading and text analysis environment for large, unstructured digital collections that include plain text (.txt), Microsoft Word, and PDF.  It is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students by displaying graphs and  word cloud… Each of these options has its own features to further visualize data. Uploading a corpus can create visualizations such as graphs of word frequencies and you may embed them into pages for future exploration. In addition, you can analyze vast amounts of textual data within and between individual texts, see word trends in single/ multiple texts and find the context of specific works and trace shifts of emphasis over time that were not previously possible. One of the reasons why we like Voyant is because it is easy to learn and user friendly. We uploaded the plain texts of Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013) and Origin (2017) and Voyant generated a default word frequency cirrus and graph. Were they hard to understand? Not at all, because Voyant portrays the ideas in a visually pleasing way that make it easy for the reader. Cirrus is insightful and it is a visual aggregation of the most common words. It indicates the most used words in the documents. That means the larger the word is represented, the more frequently across the corpus. Voyant allowed us to enter words such as “ church”, “virus”, “power”, “sin”, ”science” and even more. Their trends vary as well, for instance, in the book of Angels and Demons (2000), the trend of “science” is above “power”. These words  establish a relationship of how good and evil was portrayed in Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series. The tension between religion and science continuously showed up by searching certain words and phrases in Voyant. In some books, Christianity and the church represented the evil entity hungry for power, while in others the unethical use of bio-terrorism represented the dark side. Personally, I have never used Voyant or any other similar digital humanities tool before in any course or project, but I am very thankful that I did because I uncovered a limitless world of Digital Data!  Throughout the course, we have continuously learned about different methods for generating digital data. None of us had any prior experience with any of the tools we learned so far. Although we eventually adapted to using them efficiently to provide the needed data, we faced some issues along the way. At first, we found difficulty in finding plain texts for our novels in the right format. We struggled with finding credible online sources that we could use. In addition, many of the texts that we found contained missing parts or only included some of the chapters. After we held a meeting with Dr. Jarkas, she recommended some sources online to use and also taught us how to convert the text into (.txt) file. Once we found word documents or PDFs for all our novels, we converted them into text files and removed parts that were not necessary or segments that contained symbols. Cleaning the books in order to become in the correct format for use in the digital tools was relatively easy after we got the hang of it. One instance we particularly faced trouble with was when Voyant's website went down for an entire day while we were working on analyzing Dan Brown's books for one of our assignments which ended up getting resolved late at night when the servers were rebooted. Check our little interaction with Voyant Tools on Twitter during that blackout in the tweet below! Another process we found difficult was using TopoText for our first ever mapping assignment. TopoText was not covered in depth during our lecture, so we had to discover it by ourselves. It provided many locations in The Da Vinci Code (2003), many of which were not relevant to our topic or did not entail the important encounters of the main characters in the novel. However, since some members of the group are highly familiar with Dan Brown novels, we decided to find the relevant locations online and through skimming through the books again and manually inputting them on the spreadsheets. After researching for many hours, we were luckily able to construct the map on Google My Maps. We then set up a common Google Drive folder shared between all members of our group containing all the files related to the Digital Humanities project we have chosen, and continued to improve it for the sake of organization and completion of our work.  Regarding the other tools such as AntConc, Voyant and Palladio, applying them on our data was generally smooth. We went much more into depth on how to use these tools during class time, and were able to experiment with them using the excel sheets provided on Moodle. In the second assignment, we generated a network of data using Palladio from our own texts. We were testing out the software to decide whether to use it in later stages of our project. Using Palladio was straightforward and all of us were able to obtain adequate networks. Moving on to using textual analysis tools, we experimented with Voyant using our texts and the results looked promising. We have considered using Voyant for the entirety of the project, but we are also brainstorming on what words/phrases to use to experiment with AntConc. Generally, the network and textual analysis tools gave us no major issues. With the help of Dr. Jarkas’ feedback, guidance, and our continuous efforts, all of the tools we have learned will hopefully intertwine in our final presentation through Timeline JS.  We are all tired of studying online and would love to return to campus one day, especially with graduation being so near. Online semesters at AUB during the pandemic have been excessively tiring and difficult. Despite our clinical rotations at the hospital and our constant visits to AUBMC as Nursing students, we were still deprived of the essence of living our university life, and especially our senior year, to the fullest. Practicing certain skills with no real life application or live interaction proved to be certainly challenging and required twice the effort in order to acquire the needed dexterity. In addition, many of our classes were prerecorded and so all we would do during the day was watch 2-3 hours of recorded lectures without any interaction. This also deprived us of the chance to meet new people and make new friends through social interactions as we went from physically engaging with others to being just random individuals behind computer screens.  Lastly, and thankfully for us, ENGL 256B  is an enjoyable course that hasn't changed that much from when it was on campus. Why is this the case? Because most of the assignments on Twitter, Wordpress/Google Sites, Timeline JS and many more were already assigned as online assignments.  If anything, ENGL 256B is one of the courses that excelled during the pandemic due to the dependency of everyone, including the students, on social media. Although it made us stay on our laptops, it made us discover the endless limitations of digital humanities. During this course, all classes were interactive, with cameras on and direct conversations with the instructor. Dr. Jarkas has been very helpful and explains in details how things work and what is required from us at all times. We were not just passively watching the sessions, instead, we endeavored to use the different DH tools to generate digital data. The course does not contain exams and anti-cheating protocols but integrates beneficial group work as its most essential form of collaboration. One of the main differences in this course is that social interaction with one’s colleagues is preserved. We got to meet our colleagues from the introductory videos posted at the beginning of the semester and from the weekly sessions we hold. Also, we even interacted with colleagues from other sections through Twitter, and were updated  with their outcomes and their own beneficence from this course. As a group, we were also fortunate enough to meet in this course  since we went from being just a bunch of classmates  into actual friends.  References: Burgess, S., & Sievertsen, H. H.

Schedule,"This talk will examine the emerging areas of research in Digital Humanities in India by an examination of the term “Digital Humanities” and its uneven and uncertain trajectory in the Indian research ecosystem. As with other systems around the world, DH in India is complex and contextual and each of us involved in the disciplinary practice encounter resistance and skepticism.  Resistance to what is perceived as a deliberate distancing from the larger Humanities queries, scepticism about appropriating the rhetoric of STEM disciplines merely as a tool for greater legitimacy and validation. But of course DH is far more than a sum of its criticisms and scepticisms. I will address why it is imperative that the digital be harnessed, critiqued, deconstructed and dissected precisely so that the issues that Humanities scholars have been invested in continue to be at the centre of the development, deployment and dissemination of technology.   The Swedish Caribbean Colonialism 1784–1878 project (SweCarCol) integrates, orders and opens up important dispersed archives for research by publishing them on the Internet in cooperation with Uppsala University Library.      The paper describes and discusses a series of DH projects that have developed at CESTA and have addressed major issues in the history of the Atlantic World, including slavery and the experience of enslaved and freed persons in particular.   International, interdisciplinary spaces are inevitably sites of tension, where differences in linguistic and cultural norms run deeper than they initially appear. Establishing and maintaining a set of norms for a community to operate despite these differences requires ongoing dialogue within that community. This talk will reflect on language as one longstanding axis of diversity within digital humanities as it is carried out at the international level, as well as within different national contexts. This context will inform a frank discussion of the ways in which a general obliviousness towards languages commonly found in Anglophone countries has negatively impacted Anglophone scholars' research, pedagogy, and engagement with the broader field of DH. The talk will conclude with actionable steps that scholars, particularly in Anglophone countries, can take towards embracing language as an important axis of diversity.   While projects focused on Black culture, texts and artifacts are not as rare as they once were there remains a lack of understanding of the rich and deep histories of Black DH and its impact on the field. Sharon Leon’s foundation chapter, “Complicating a ‘Great Man’ Narrative of Digital History in the United States,” serves as a model of the necessary documentation that scholars must compile of alternative histories of digital humanities. Accordingly, this talk will document a deep dig into the ecology of digital humanities, centering Black DH work in the field. Among the scholars’ work discussed will be Abduhl Alkalimat, creator of e-black studies, Bryan Carter, Virtual Harlem, Marilyn Miller Thomas-Houston, iBlack Studies and co-editor of the multi-media journal Fire!!, Ronald Bailey, who developed www.dignubia.org and www.nubianet.org and Afro Publishing without Walls, and Maryemma Graham, History of Black writing. An ongoing project, I am conducting interviews with such foundational Black dh scholars to better understand their contributions to the field.  This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion we will broaden the question to digital humanities, and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalised in digital humanities discourse.  This talk has two parts. It will first attempt to frame what a history of digital history might look like, by focusing on hybridity as a key characteristic of historical research, seen as some form of integrating newly emerging tools, technologies, materials, and/or practices in historical research, and mapped and qualified according to the main phases of historical research. My main argument here is that, in order to ground our current ‘digital’ practices and learn from past experiences and expertise, we need an answer to the question: what were, and are, the continuities and ruptures in the use and uptake of new technologies in historical research, and in the debates that accompanied them?
		The paper will then proceed to outline what groundwork is necessary to explore digital history’s forgotten roots: a basic overview of the field’s different spatio-temporal trajectories and the networks of computing historians in the pre-PC and early PC period. A key focal point for such a reconstruction are the DH conferences that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, either as singular events or strands of bigger conferences such as the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Moscow in 1970, and later those that were organised under the aegis of the Association for History and Computing (AHC, 1987-2001) and its national member organisations. By studying which scholars attended and where they came from, and by linking that to the topics and methods that were discussed, it will be possible to chart, over time, shifting geographical, topical and methodological developments.
	In the second part of my paper, I will provide the first results of a concrete case study which is part of this broader endeavour, namely a web archaeology of the old AHC website and H-NET Discussion List for History and Computing (now: H-DigitalHistory).  The Digital Humanities have profoundly altered the way that humanities scholars work, research, and teach. While the introduction of computational methods, from GIS, to Digital Archives, to Text Mining, have opened up new fields to practitioners, these fields have also changed the social fabric of the humanities. Although the myth of the lone scholar, toiling away in their office, or in the archives, remains deeply embedded in the psyche of the discipline, the growing influence of the Digital Humanities has begun to offer scholars other opportunities for research work and teaching. Not only are our new methods collaborative by nature, they are often collaborative by necessity, frequently requiring us to work in teams that can leverage different experience and skills towards a set of research goals. In this talk, I want to explore the ramifications of this shift in research practice, focusing on the sociology of the humanities lab, as distinct from both the science laboratory, and the traditional practices of History, Classics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Literary Study. How has the collaborative nature of our work altered the kinds of research that we can produce? How has interdisciplinary cooperation challenged ideas of evidence, method and results in the humanities? How has the collaborative model of research changed our pedagogy? What new kinds of equality, and inequality, between faculty, staff and students, has this change enabled? And what does it mean to work collaborative in fields whose institutional structures persist in disincentivizing collaboration? Drawing on my own experience working at, and directing, the Stanford Literary Lab, an ongoing collaborative research group that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, I want to focus on the outstanding questions that we are only now beginning to address around this radical shift in the humanities.

Digital Humanities Research and Study| ARMACAD,"Thousands of study and academic opportunities in Digital Humanities are available internationally. Conferences and summer schools in Digital Humanities are organized regularly in the best academic centers of the world. The majority of universities and many foundations also offer BA, MA and PhD programs in Digital Humanities as wells as postdoctoral research grants, awards and fellowships. Below you will find the updated list of international opportunities available in Digital Humanities. Digital Humanities takes the modern development of technologies and computation to the spheres of art, culture, history, and other important aspects of human life. Generally, it can be described as the classic study of humanities, developed and integrated into the modern data collecting and analyzing tools. Through digital humanities, scholars attempt to answer the old questions in a new way. Particularly, scholars continue to explore humans and their origin. However, the methods of exploration have completely gone digital. The formation of the digital humanities as a phenomenon lay on two basic foundations. Firstly, around 40 years ago, the technological advancements which helped us store the physical materials came to the stage. People were able to create digital databases for the materials that traditionally served as the only source of examining human past and origin: texts, artworks, artifacts, cultural objects, etc.  Later, computers were enriched with not only storage capacities but also with statistical and analytical programming tools. That was the origin of digital humanities when scholars not only saved but also used and analyzed the vast volumes of data about the past's cultural heritage.  The current digital humanities are about making the texting data out of the massive pool of digitized information from sources like libraries and museums. Later, it's about data manipulation tools to find patterns in the data, analyze it and translate it into new theoretical knowledge. Also, digital humanities help us to create many innovations for current and future life. For example, the recent digital imaging advancements made it possible to produce high-quality reproductions of saved books and artworks. This, in turn, may transform the way people learn from these materials in the future.  Digital Humanities might not sound to you as a popular discipline, the way economics, business, management, and other similar do. However, this academic direction is intensively developing throughout recent years, and there are many universities where you can find DH educational programs. The scholarship list above might even help you study some of those programs at lower or no costs.  A unique thing about digital humanities is that it is usually taught at the Master's level, and there are significantly fewer Bachelor's courses for it.  You might guess that DH studies cover two main study areas: Humanities and Computer Science. Similarly, the basic skills of the mentioned two areas are the program's main admissions requirements. If you don't have a chance to study at Bachelor's of Digital Humanities, your chances to do it in Master's significantly increase if you hold the completion certificate of Bachelor's in Humanities or Bachelors in Computer Sciences.  The course titles might differ in particular universities, but usually, the digital humanities program covers the following main subjects: During many DH programs, students can have a working period in places like museums, libraries, galleries, etc. It is a great way to utilize theoretical knowledge in practice and generally understand what direction of DH careers is closer to you. This practice is offered to students under the ""Work Placement"" course subject, and it would be a good idea to check its availability before applying to the university.  The standard courses within the complete academic program of digital humanities have the following breakdown of course subjects: Before listing where you can utilize your digital humanities skills, let's go through the main skills you will acquire during the studies. Those include: Aside from all these, students of digital humanities receive solid training for writing and presentation skills and creative problem-solving. Without the mentioned skills, all the genuinely massive analytical work with the data will remain useless. Students should be able to identify the logical cues between data hints and real-life questions. Also, they should be able to effectively communicate their findings within the team and collaborate for more fundamental findings.  It sounds like the discipline will grant you the most up-to-date and competitive skills. Therefore, the range of career applications for DH is also high. It's worth mentioning that usually, pure humanity studies are considered a weak base for finding employment in the future. That's because classic studies of humanities are too theoretical, and students usually graduate with many soft skills. In this regard, Digital humanities add hard competitive skills to traditional humanities studies and significantly increase the qualification of the graduates.  So, the leading career perspectives of DH majors include: Also, you can freely work in traditional IT jobs like Web Developers, Mobile Developers, UI/UX Developers, Data Managers, Metadata Managers, Digital Resources Specialists, etc.  Digital Humanities is one of the most interesting disciplines, both in terms of the idea behind it and its main tools and methodologies. We hope this section of ARMACAD will open doors to try yourself in the sphere and gift society with new and amazing findings.

PROJECT: Digital Humanities Net/Works ← dh+lib,"where the digital humanities and librarianship meet Launched in December 2020 through the University of Buffalo Libraries, Digital Humanities Net/Works is an online forum and journal that offers opportunities for the “the exchange of ideas among DH practitioners on the most significant questions or issues in our field and on ways to rethink technology and online structures in order to make them more responsive to issues of diversity and inclusion.” Further,  The DH Net/Works constitutes a digital experiment in networking, beyond the blog, more flexible than the journal, and oriented toward initiating structures of change. Like a journal, it has an editor and advisory board; like a blog, it allows relatively simple entry into the conversation, quick response turn-around, and strong encouragement to include a diversity and range of voices. DH Net/Works takes as its platform and focus both the “net”/internet and the products and agency of our “works,” the activity of our research and digital productivity and what we hope may become a growing community of scholars thinking and working collaboratively to make digital systems, structures, and algorithms as open, accessible, and equitable as possible. The premium in DH Net/Works editorial oversight (Editorial Principles) is on openness of scholarly exchange, adhering to principles of equity and diversity, and maintaining an atmosphere of respect, leading ideally toward possibilities for collaborative thinking and action. It constitutes a digital experiment in networking, beyond the blog, more flexible than the journal, and oriented toward initiating structures of change. Obviously, this includes openness to change and experimentation on the DHN/W site itself, which is continually in process. DH Net/Works represents an important dynamic experiment not only in digital publishing, but also as an effort towards collectivity and open collaboration amongst DH practitioners.  This post was produced through a cooperation between Anne Donlon, Colleen Farry, Tierney Gleason, David Gustavsen, Jennifer Hootman, Jill Krefft, and Jennifer Matthews (Editors-at-Large for the week), Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara (Editor for the week), and Caitlin Christian-Lamb, Alasdair Ekpenyong, Linsey Ford, and Pamella Lach (dh+lib Review Editors). about dh+lib | ISSN 2380-1255 (online)",https://dhandlib.org/2021/04/15/project-digital-humanities-net-works/

In this meeting, they introduced their doctoral thesis. 
 Ali Şir Nevâyî and Garâibü's-Sıgar  The main points of my thesis are the Chagatay field of Old Turkish literature, Ali Şir Nevâyî, the greatest poet of this field, and his diwan named Garâibü's-Sıgar. Old Turkish literature is the branch of Turkish literature that has been kneaded with the influence of Arabic and Persian literatures with the adoption of Islam. Chagatay Turkish and literature made with this Turkish is the branch of Old Turkish literature that developed in Central Asia.
And this branch will give its best examples in Ali Şir Nevâyî's verses from the second half of the 15th century. That is, Ali Şir Nevâyî is one of the Chagatay poets of Old Turkish literature. Garâibü’s-Sıgar is the diwan of Ali Şir Nevâyî, which contains poems written in his childhood.


Ali Şir Nevâyî, who shaped Chagatay poetry, which is the branch of Classical Turkish Poetry developing in Central Asia, is one of the greatest poets of the whole world literature, accepted as masters by both Eastern and Western Turkish poets with his original dreams in his poems, strong style and competence in using the language.
He wrote his works with a national linguistic consciousness. He is a precious person who is known not only in the environment where he was born and lived, but also in the whole Turkish world, whose fame went beyond the ages.
Nevâyî, a poet, scholar and statesman who helped the formation and development of classical Chagatay literature, contributed to our cultural world with more than thirty works he wrote. Among all these works, first of all, it is necessary to mention his works named Mecâlisü'n-Nefâis and Muhâkemetü'l-Lugateyn, where he tried to prove the superiority of Turkish over Persian.
The poet has classified his Turkish poems into childhood, youth, middle age and old age.
1.         Garā’ibü’s-Sıgar,
2.         Nevādirü’ş-Şebāb,
3.         Bedāyi’u’l-Vasat,
4.         Fevāyidü’l-Kiber,
However, these denominations are a continuation of a tradition. In other words, poems in the poems are not separated by a certain age restriction. There is no difference in beauty and competence between the poems he wrote in childhood and the ones he wrote in old age. A poem in which the poet mentions his gray hair can also be found in the diwan where his childhood poems take place.
The work we are working on among these diwans is the diwan named Garâibü's-Sıgar, which consists of poems that the poet said he wrote during his childhood -up to the age of twenty.
In our thesis, based on the study named ""Alī Şīr Nevāyī Garâ'ibü’s-Sıgar, Review-Comparative Text, Ankara: TDK Publications, 2003"" prepared by Prof. Dr. Günay Kut.
As a result,
- The most important element that makes up classical Turkish poetry is imagination. For centuries, poets have pursued how to find original dreams while using common expression, and how to express these dreams in the best way by constructing them with the most beautiful words in the language. In our study, we focus on the artistic side of Ali Şir Nevâyî.
Thus, we will be able to evaluate how classical poetry uses this common material and its success in this through Garâ’ibü’s-Sıgar. In addition, we will be able to observe the effects of Garaibü’s-Sıgar both in its own field and in the Anatolian field both during and after its transfer.
- The full text of the divan will be created by completing the words and incomplete couplets with comparative studies.
- By examining Nevâyî's vocabulary, language and style features through Garâ’ibü’s-Sıgar, he will be able to draw his poet portrait.
 The Cosmological Elements in Ali-Shir Nava’i’s Turkish Diwans
   Writing a PhD thesis is a rocky road, especially determining the main subject of the thesis. As I know this truth, I try to explain the main points of my thesis. I’ve focused on my thesis cosmology and cosmological elements in Ali-Shir Navayi’s Turkish Diwans. So, my thesis is a basic example of interdisciplinary studies. I want to establish a mutual relation with cosmology and literature, especially classical Turkish and Cagatay literature.


Cosmology is a scientific field that is concerned about the whole universe. Literature is a discipline which uses words and involves cosmology, theology, history, politics, art, sociology, psychology and all things about human beings. This multi-layer status of literature is the starting point of my thesis. I’ve been making use of the method of the thesis which name is “The Cosmical Elements of Some Turkish Poets at Turkish Diwans in 16th Century” and written by Prof. Dr. Sebahat Deniz.

Ali-Shir Nava’i (9 February 1441-3 January 1501), who is the biggest poet of Chagatay literature has made a big contribution to Turkish culture as a poet and as a statesman. Ali-Shir Nava’i who had taken a good education and have knowledge of different science has reflected his knowledge in his works successfully. Ali-Shir Nava’i lived at the same time Ulug Beg and Ali Kuşçu who are the most important people of Turkish astronomy history. 15th Century is the most productive time for Muslim-Turkish scientist in astronomy. Ali-Shir Nava’i’s poems analyzed with regard to vocabulary, imagination variety and extended metaphor, amazing scenes are seen. An amazing scene of these is uses of cosmological elements in his works, frequently. The most beautiful examples of this uses are seen in his Turkish diwans. So the poems of these diwans are very succesfully as literal form and techniques. In the view of this information, my thesis aims will be determined uses of cosmological elements in Turkısh dıwans of Ali-Shir Nava’i and will be tried to explain Ali Şîr Nevâyî’s artistic creativity about universe.
 [People] are becoming increasingly connected by the growth of affordable mobile (smart) technology. It is necessary to think upon new and innovative ways for acquiring, engaging and servicing these “connected consumers”. The goal of the project is to encourage society to become more involved in identification, preservation, and consumption of cultural heritage by developing training programs and educational materials for libraries via Massive Open On-line Course (MOOC) thus promoting or contributing in re-designing existing and co-creating innovative services in cultural heritage institutions.The project consortium consists of six organizations from which two are libraries. Strong academic background for adult education tools and methods will be provided by three universities:Tallinn University, Hacettepe University and Universite De Marne La Vallee.

Please note that the number of participants will be limited. For questions, Lee Ann Glowzenski: laglowzenski@gmail.com and Julia Bleakney: jbleakney@elon.edu.


WLN: A Journal of Writing Center Scholarship invites participants to its inaugural Manuscript Writing Bootcamp (100% online). Meeting once a week for 8 weeks through June-July 2021, the WLN Manuscript Writing Bootcamp will give you time and support to get an entire first draft of a manuscript written and submitted to WLN for review. We recognize how hard it can be to carve out time for research and writing during these challenging times, and we hope the WLN Manuscript Writing Boot Camp will give potential WLN authors the support and structure needed to write a manuscript draft.
Who should attend?
You are working on an article that you believe would be a good fit for WLN, or have already submitted a manuscript to WLN and are going through the revision process. Writers working on RAD-projects as well as non-RAD or narrative-based projects are welcome. Those who have some data or research in hand, are members of underrepresented groups, or are previously unpublished in WLN are encouraged to apply.
When?
The bootcamp will run for 8 weeks through June and July. Bootcamp leaders (coeditors of WLN) and all participants meet once a week for 2-3 hours. We’ll make a final decision on the day and time with the confirmed participants, though it will be a week day (not Saturday or Sunday).
What’s the format?
During the first meeting in June, we’ll provide an overview of the review and publishing process for WLN. We’ll also gauge your needs for additional support (e.g. numerical analysis, coding schemes, etc.) Each subsequent week, we’ll do a check-in at the beginning and end of each bootcamp and the rest of the time is for participants to get some productive writing done in a supportive environment. Bootcamp leaders will offer two or three informal workshops on topics of interest, if needed, and invite you to give periodic feedback to a “boot camp buddy”– another participant in the bootcamp. Leaders will also be available to meet with you once or twice during the bootcamp and to read draft sections.*
What’s the cost?
There is no cost except for your time. We ask that you commit to completing the bootcamp.
How do I sign up?
Please complete this application form by May 3: https://tinyurl.com/WLNbootcamp
** Please note: We cannot guarantee that participation in the bootcamp will result in an accepted publication, as all manuscripts go through an external, rigorous peer-review process. We will limit the number of participants if we get a lot of interest.

Home | Mysite,"Home About Themes Schedule Bibliography More Ecologies Entrelacées Unearthing and Reimagining Gender and Environment in the Francophone Caribbean While the Caribbean may be perceived as beautiful and lush, the history and legacies of colonization in the region reveal a complicated underside. Colonialism and capitalism have shaped relationships between humans and land, tying patterns of domination to both environment and gender. It is critical to understand this history when considering the overt effects of climate change today, and it is crucial to include the humanities and social sciences in these discussions. ​ This bilingual digital humanities project aims to interrogate questions of capitalism, colonialism, gender, and environment in the Francophone Caribbean. The project’s goal is to uncover nuanced ways in which narratives of ecology and gender have been systematically suppressed and reduced—and conversely, to examine how these same narratives continuously resist and disorder dominant structures of power. To do this, we will look at four subtopics: sugar, bananas, beaches, and gardens. These commodities and spaces that are foundational to common imaginaries of the Caribbean. But they are also symbols of more complex histories, representing the direct social, cultural, and ecological consequences. Dr. Schuyler Esprit will present, ""Heartland: An Almanac for Caribbean Futures"", which is an exploration of agriculture, astronomy, and climate through her geneological history and her family's once thriving banana farm. Dr. Esprit is the Founder of Create Caribbean, the first digital humanities center in the Caribbean. She is a Caribbean Studies scholar and her research on the Caribbean has been diverse. She has more than ten years’ experience in university teaching and administration and has taught academic writing, research methods and Caribbean and postcolonial literature and culture. More specifically, her areas of scholarly interest include Caribbean cultural studies, environmental and ecological humanities, and digital scholarship and new media in the Caribbean. She is a writer and editor, and her work has appeared in a range of academic and popular publications including Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, archipelagos journal, and Moko Magazine.

President Biden Will Give Each American A Free Minor In Digital Humanities From SUNY Oswego - ABSOLUTE GENERAL NEWS,"Publisher - ABSOLUTE GENERAL NEWS DAILY

  More than 44 million Americans share a collective debt burden of $ 1.5 trillion, and that number is only growing because of skyrocketing tuition fees and high interest rates.  Fortunately, President Biden has just signed an ordinance that will make life a lot easier for Americans pursuing a college degree: the government will now give every American a free minor in Digital Humanities from SUNY Oswego. Brilliant!  In a press conference today, Biden announced that all US citizens over the age of 18 will soon receive a diploma certifying the completion of 18 Digital Humanities Credits at SUNY Oswego.  With millions of Americans struggling to make payments on their student loans, a free minor who shows they’ve completed courses such as Fundamentals of Digital Imagery and Ethics and Social Policy in the Digital Age will keep our next generation from doing the sort of thing Crippling is stuck in debts the generation before them endured.  “Students who would have taken out thousands of dollars in college education can now instead save their money and use their Digital Humanities minor to help secure employment opportunities that include skills such as digital text analysis, digital mapping and web design,” said he the president.  “At the very least, these minors should qualify all Americans for internships that, while not full-time positions, definitely provide the workplace experience and networking necessary to build a career in the field.” If that wasn’t big enough, Biden went on to say that he will help those who have already amassed college debt by giving them a Dean’s List certificate stating that their accumulated GPA is at least in their Digital Humanities Minor a was 3.8 and by receiving an award entitled “The Mark C. Heller Award for Excellence in the Digital Humanities” to Americans with a student loan of more than $ 100,000. This is so great!  A free Digital Humanities minor from one of the best SUNY satellite campuses will contribute so much to the many Americans who otherwise would have gone to college that they will face terrible credit scores and payments that they simply could not afford.

"Toward an Ecosystem of the Syriac Digital Humanities: An Interview with George A. Kiraz, 5th and Final Part – The Digital Orientalist","The Digital Orientalist Practical examples and theoretical reflections on the do's and don'ts of using digital tools for your study and research in African and Asian Studies. This is the sixth and final post of a series by the Digital Orientalist’s Syriac Studies Editor, Ephrem Ishac, based on his interview with George A. Kiraz. The introduction to the series can be viewed here, the first part here, the second part here, and the third part here.The Digital Orientalist began to serialize this interview between Syriac Studies Editor, Ephrem Ishac, and Dr. George A. Kiraz in early 2020. Following an introduction to the Syriac Digital Humanities, the first part of the interview focused on Dr. Kiraz’s interest in computers and the beginnings of his journey in the Digital Humanities. The second part focused on Dr. Kiraz’s interest in printing and the creation of Gorgias Press. The third part explored the Beth Mardutho (The Syriac Institute) and ecumenical approaches to Syriac heritage. The fourth part focused on early ideas for digitizing Syriac manuscripts. The final part explores ongoing projects in Beth Mardutho.  Meeting of Syriaca.org at Beth Mardutho.  Ephrem: Now we reach our last three questions! Could you tell us shortly and generally about the ongoing projects on the Syriac digital humanities that you are involved with, especially those projects that Beth Mardutho has been hosting? G. Kiraz: Yes, so if you visit bethmardutho.org you will see the various projects that we are engaged in on the homepage, including the online encyclopedia e-GEDSH which is encoded in TEI, XML and eXist-db. We have also Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies, which is one of the earliest open-source journals in the digital humanities. It is also encoded in TEI and XML and run by James E. Walters. We also have SEDRA – a lexicographical database that I mentioned previously. Finally, there is the project that we are currently very excited about – Qoruyo. Qoruyo seeks to create OCR and handwriting recognition models to turn printed books and manuscripts into searchable texts. Alongside there is Thesaurus: SIMTHO which is a small project, but currently contains over six million words and is growing. We now have over 50,000 pages of PDF files and we are starting our second phase of OCR-ing these documents. Of course, this is a project that will take many years complete, but the aim is to have a large Syriac linguistic corpus that people can use in their research. I use these tools myself on a weekly basis for various purposes.  The history of Syriac Computing.  Homepage for Thesaurus: SIMTHO.  Ephrem: I know that it’s difficult to ask if a father has a favorite child, but can you talk more about your oldest – and perhaps ‘favorite’ baby, SEDRA? Currently we have SEDRA IV. What is the future of SEDRA? G. Kiraz: I think the future of SEDRA and the other projects at Beth Mardutho need to move in the direction of integration. The vision is to have the lexical and textual resources linked with the editions of texts, manuscripts, and manuscripts catalogs; to move toward having a digital ecosystem of Syriac studies. This is also the vision of syriaca.org, which is led by David A. Michelson and his colleagues. So, the vision is to have a network of portals that can communicate with each other through an API. That’s where we would like to go with all these things that we have been developing.  Developments in SEDRA announced at Syriaca.org‘s Workshop in 2017.  A floppy disc contained some of Brockelman’s Lexicon for SEDRA.  Ephrem: Do I understand that you think it would be much better if we work together with our different projects in Syriac studies? In other words, is it better that we harmonize our work on different projects in Syriac digital humanities to integrate all these projects at a certain point? G. Kiraz: Sure! I very much encourage everyone to go with the platform that they prefer, but it would be beneficial if it was a platform that has an API which can communicate with other platforms. Let’s say, for example, that you have a catalogue of manuscripts and you’re writing the titles and the colophons and you can easily link it with SEDRA, then anybody who is on your catalog could  on a word and discover its meanings or  on a word and go find its occurrences in the SIMTHO database. So, if your catalogue has an API, then we can talk to your catalog in the future and everybody can talk to each other in the world of digital humanities.  Syriaca.org  Ephrem: That leads us to our last question – Do you think that our digital humanities projects should be based some principles such as sharing our databases for the sake of developing the Syriac digital humanities? Can you say some final words on projects which choose to close their databases rather than opening them to be shared with others? G. Kiraz: Unless there are some motivations based on necessity, I don’t think it is a good idea to develop closed projects and I believe it will likely introduce limitations into the project. Of course, open projects can also face limitations. Most of our projects at Beth Mardutho are run by volunteers and are limited by funding possibilities. If you have a project with limited funded, you need to think what will happen to the database once the period of funding has finished. We also need to consider what happens to our data both after a project and also during it – what happens to the data if the investigator is the victim of an accident or illness, for example. There are some possible resolutions such as the aforementioned linking of our portals through APIs, but it doesn’t stop there because there is also the raw data to think about.  Kiraz lecturing on digital humanities for the MA programme in Syriac Theology – Salzburg, 2017.  If you have a database, then it is implemented under some system, it could be PHP: MySQL. It could be Microsoft SQL. It could be some other open access database; but at some point it has some sort of a format. It’s not a file that I can print on a piece of paper and access the raw data of. So, it is crucially important that people export their data periodically, take snapshots of it, and transfer the raw materials into Unicode files, simple flat files, or XML files – readable files in an accessible format that can be printed. Have it in that format and put it somewhere periodically (like Github), so that if your project stops, if you cannot continue, then your work is not wasted. That’s my advice to people and is what we do with our projects. The plan for SEDRA, which of course has an API, is to periodically output all of the data and put it online. That means somebody else can take it and create their own SEDRA if they want to, and they’re more than welcome to do so. The same thing goes for the source text of SIMTHO. Of course, when it comes to SIMTHO, there are some things that necessitate closure. For example, publishers would object to their text being released – there are the copyright laws and you cannot break the law, but when there are things that are in the public domain you can do it. Ephrem: That’s very helpful and I hope that this can clarify the mission of ongoing and future projects in Syriac digital humanities. tawdi sagi Malphono! G. Kiraz: Lo medem!

"- Aufbauseminar: Digital Humanities - Your student research project
				Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf","Overview This seminar is a free research seminar. Participants design and conduct together (up to two team members) or alone a research project.   Aim Organization and structure What are Digital Humanities? Of course, we’ll talk about this in our first seminar lecture. However, for everyone who does not know the concept in general the following information is given: Digital humanities is quite a young discipline still in the process of a proper definition. ”[..] concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It is methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form. It studies how these media affect the disciplines in which they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to our knowledge of computing” (Kirschbaum, 2010). However, this definition goes back to a Wikipedia entry, as Kirschbaum and several other researchers denote. Besides this first working definition, the project ”What is digital humanities?” (Link: https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) provides over 800 self-reported definitions giving further first impressions. The goal of this course is to develop your own scientific project. You will present your progress each week to discuss it with the other students. The execution of the project (e.g. collecting survey data or conducting interviews) is not a mandatory part of the curriculum as this would be too time intensive. If you already have some ideas, please present them during our first meeting. However, this is not a requirement, as we will develop a project idea together. The thematic areas possible to study are: If these areas are not familiar to you, we invite you to inform yourself beforehand to gather inspiration for your research project. Possible project examples:   Reference Kirschbaum, M. G. (2010). What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments? ADE Bulletin, 150, 1-7.

,"An ADHO Special Interest Group A survey to gauge the interest of the community for a technical mentorship program. As a result of the DHTech survey it came to our attention that quite a number of people said they were working in DH as single programmers. Additionally, many people doing coding related work in DH don’t have a formal computer science degree but are self-taught or taught on the job. For RSEs in such a situation it can be challenging to get guidance and support in all phases of a project; be it the project planning phase, where knowledge of existing tools and workflows can greatly improve the reusability and long-term accessibility, or during the actual software development phase, where a simple question sometimes takes a day to answer (we have all been there!). Thus, the idea formed to develop a technical mentoring program that provides mentees with a technical mentor who can answer questions and can offer guidance on, for example, design and infrastructure questions. Such a program would not be a replacement for training or workshops that teach specific skills, but could support people doing technical work in DH by providing a means to have low frequency but high quality conversations with experienced RSEs. Of course, such a system of mentoring could also be valuable for more experienced RSEs who enter into a new field such as data modelling or 3D visualizations. There are several questions that need to be answered to successfully implement a technical mentorship program. How could such a program give appropriate credit and recognition for mentors (e.g. acknowledgement in publications or on websites, allocation in institutional workload)? What would be the expectations of mentee and mentor? How would mentor and mentee be matched? How much time should a mentor commit to the program? We plan to work on providing a guide to these questions in the next few weeks. Anyone interested in joining the discussion is welcome to join us on Slack. The first step, however, will be to gauge the interest of the community for such a program. For this purpose, we have created a short survey that can be accessed here. If you would consider becoming a mentor or a mentee, please fill out the form. Filling out the form is not a commitment to either yet, just an indication of interest. If there is enough interest in the community for a technical mentorship program, we will follow up with a registration process at a later time. Powered by  Jekyll

USM Set to Host Inaugural Digital Humanities Conference | The University of Southern Mississippi,"Mon,
                  								04/05/2021 - 14:49pm | By: Van Arnold In an effort to explore cutting edge research in digital humanities, The University
                  of Southern Mississippi (USM) will host an inaugural conference titled, Digital Lagniappe, in a virtual format on Friday, April 16. The conference will take place over Zoom
                  and anyone interested in digital humanities is invited to attend.
                The conference includes five interactive roundtables featuring leading DH scholars
                  from across the United States and the United Kingdom as they discuss their work and
                  how DH methodologies help them advance related research.
                The conference also includes a special presentation on some new technology in the
                  field - DataScribe - that offers new approaches for transcription creation and analysis.
                  Throughout the day, attendees will have the opportunity to pose questions about their
                  own work to the panelists in a vibrant exchange of ideas.
                Dr. Susannah Ural, Professor of History at USM, is helping coordinate the conference.
                  She is the Director of her own DH project, “The Civil War & Reconstruction Governors
                  of Mississippi.” Ural is hopeful that this initial event will be the first of many
                  annual DH conferences at USM.
                “We’re bringing together the latest work in the field to help scholars and students
                  learn from each other’s efforts and discuss current challenges in DH,” said Ural,
                  who is also a Co-Director of The Dale Center for the Study of War & Society. “The informal, welcoming nature of the conference also makes it a great place for
                  non-experts to learn about DH and its possibilities in their own work.”
                Digital Humanities is defined as an area of scholarly activity at the intersection
                  of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing
                  scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged
                  research, teaching, and publishing.
                Ural invites readers with questions to reach out to her or to her conference co-hosts
                  Dr. Stephanie Seal Walters (USM School of Humanities Digital Liaison) or Ms. Maeve
                  Losen (USM DH graduate assistant).

Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed: Anti-Colonial DH Pedagogy as Care Work – Humanities Commons,"Open access, open source, open to all Public Group  61 Members This space is the repository for the papers, presentations (slides, videos, etc) that will form the basis of the CSDH-SCHN 2021 online conference, to take place May 30-June 3rd. As scholars of colour with contingent access to and precarious movements within privileged academic spaces, we began the Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed collective because we were witnessing and experiencing the colonial, white supremacist oppressions built into mainstream computer systems and, relatedly, replicated in the field of mainstream digital humanities (DH). Engaging with and guided by the work of Black, Indigenous, racialized, queer, feminist, and disabled scholars who are writing and speaking out about these issues (Ansloos; Bailey; Benjamin; Brocke; Duarte; Francisco-Menchavez; Freire; Hamraie; Kim; McKittrick; Noble; Phillips; Piepzna-Samarasinha; Risam; Wemigwans), we hoped to foster a community of thinkers who sought to work together to imagine-into-being a liberating “otherwise” for DH, and to support one another through the challenges of creating that “otherwise” — an otherwise that nurtures the ethics of what these citations might bring to the classroom, of what their material entanglements might do, of where and with whom we practice our scholarship.  As we will discuss in this paper, Covid-19 has brought into overt and urgent view the immense systemic failures of higher education pedagogy for lives already vulnerable and precarious. Amidst the university’s push for “business as usual,” we find ourselves asking: What do messages of safety or of “being safe” mean in the context of anti-colonial DH pedagogy as we move our classes and communities entirely online? Following the words of Katherine McKittrick, how can we forget — for all too many of us are forgetting — that many of our students and colleagues already navigated unsafe lives before this global pandemic? Revisiting Dorothy Kim’s teachings on “Race, Social Justice and DH”, how can we overlook the hostility of already popular online spaces to targeted bodies and anti-racist, anti-casteist, and anti-patriarchal classroom and studio conversations? What constitutes the “essentials” of online and remote learning in this pandemic, so that our pedagogies are not merely mediated by elected (or enforced) web platforms but instead are always critical of their capacities for and claims to provide a “safe space” for learning and teaching?  In response to these questions, we have been talking about care work (Piepzna-Samarasinha) and about what anti-colonial DH care work would, could, and should look like. In this paper, we will suggest that, in contrast to the university’s current colonial-capitalist use of digital technology for pandemic learning and knowledge production, or even co-optation of critical digital discourse in the name of care, scholars and educators should engage with digital technology in ways that help to build, organize, and nourish communities of action against colonizing logics and towards greater support, kindness, and sustained care for one another — both in the present pandemic, but also in and for our mutual long-term futures. Our paper will provide an invitation and a call-to-action to foster DH communities that, through deep care work, have the ability to not only dismantle capitalist-colonial systems and capitalist-colonial responses to sociocultural, sociopolitical issues, but also to honour embodied technologies and lived realities in the production of classroom-based DH learning.

At this moment when all of us, suddenly, have become teachers in the digital space, this volume provides the kinds of hands on, practical advice educators need to navigate the complexities of teaching in the digital humanities. Ten years ago, half of the topics covered in these essays wouldn't even be topics of discussion, but today are part of our regular teaching practices. None of us will ever master all aspects of DH teaching, but taken together, the essays in this volume come close. ""I'm not sure I can"". ""I'm not sure my students can."" ""I don't think I'd know where to begin"" ""I don't really see the point, to be honest"". Decades after the emergence of digital humanities, the field can still seem daunting to outsiders and integration to teaching projects remains uneven. That's where this book comes in, presenting a variety of ambitious yet accessible, real-life projects to inspire and embolden. A stepping stone to a new dimension. Featuring a wide variety of examples from educators from across higher-ed, this Quick Hits volume is as useful to educators looking to develop digital humanities classes as it is to more advanced practitioners interested in integrating the latest tools and approaches. By highlighting field-tested methods in digital humanities teaching, the essays collected here will greatly enrich scholars' ability to enhance their curricular interventions, both conceptually and methodologically.  Indiana UniversityBloomington Connect With Us  © 2022 The Trustees of

What the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed - The New York Times,"By Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Anjali Singhvi, Audra D. S. Burch, Troy Griggs, Mika Gröndahl, Lingdong Huang, Tim Wallace, Jeremy White and Josh WilliamsMay 24, 2021 
A century ago, a prosperous Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Okla., perished at the hands of a violent white mob.
 
The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 killed hundreds of residents, burned more than 1,250 homes and erased years of Black success.

	Imagine a community of great possibilities and prosperity built by Black people for Black people. Places to work. Places to live. Places to learn and shop and play. Places to worship.
 
	Now imagine it being ravaged by flames.
 
	In May 1921, the Tulsa, Okla., neighborhood of Greenwood was a fully realized antidote to the racial oppression of the time. Built in the early part of the century in a northern pocket of the city, it was a thriving community of commerce and family life to its roughly 10,000 residents.
 
	Brick and wood-frame homes dotted the landscape, along with blocks lined with grocery stores, hotels, nightclubs, billiard halls, theaters, doctor’s offices and churches.
 
	Greenwood was so promising, so vibrant that it became home to what was known as America’s Black Wall Street. But what took years to build was erased in less than 24 hours by racial violence — sending the dead into mass graves and forever altering family trees.
 
	Hundreds of Greenwood residents were brutally killed, their homes and businesses wiped out. They were casualties of a furious and heavily armed white mob of looters and arsonists. One factor that drove the violence: resentment toward the Black prosperity found in block after block of Greenwood.
 
	The financial toll of the massacre is evident in the $1.8 million in property loss claims — $27 million in today’s dollars — detailed in a 2001 state commission report. For two decades, the report has been one of the most comprehensive accounts to reveal the horrific details of the massacre — among the worst racial terror attacks in the nation’s history — as well as the government’s culpability.
 
	The destruction of property is only one piece of the financial devastation that the massacre wrought. Much bigger is a sobering kind of inheritance: the incalculable and enduring loss of what could have been, and the generational wealth that might have shaped and secured the fortunes of Black children and grandchildren.
 
	“What if we had been allowed to maintain our family business?” asked Brenda Nails-Alford, who is in her early 60s. The Greenwood Avenue shoe shop of her grandfather and his brother was destroyed. “If they had been allowed to carry on that legacy,” she said, “there’s no telling where we could be now.”
 
	For decades, what happened in Greenwood was willfully buried in history. Piecing together archival maps and photographs, with guidance from historians, The New York Times constructed a 3-D model of the Greenwood neighborhood as it was before the destruction. The Times also analyzed census data, city directories, newspaper articles, and survivor tapes and testimonies from that time to show the types of people who made up the neighborhood and contributed to its vibrancy.
 
	Perhaps no other collection of businesses tells the story of Greenwood and Black entrepreneurship better than the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue, rising near the southern tip of the neighborhood. This marquee block was the pulse of the Black business community.
 
More than 70 businesses operated in mostly one-, two- and three-story red brick buildings clustered along the block. All but a couple were owned by Black entrepreneurs.
 
In this stretch alone, there were four hotels, two newspapers, eight doctors, seven barbers, nine restaurants and a half-dozen professional offices of real estate agents, dentists and lawyers. A cabaret and a cigar shop were on the block, too.
 
You could shop for groceries, play pool, take in a theater show, eat dinner or get your hair styled — without ever leaving the block.
 
	“My grandfather often talked about how you could enjoy a full life in Greenwood, that everything you needed or wanted was in Greenwood. You never had to go anywhere,” said Star Williams, 40, the granddaughter of Otis Grandville Clark, who was 18 during the massacre. “He talked about seeing Black success and how his sense of identity and pride came from Greenwood.”
 
	The businesses on Greenwood Avenue were owned by people who were among Tulsa’s most prominent Black citizens.
 
Loula and John Williams came to embody the entrepreneurial spirit of Greenwood. They owned a confectionery at 102 Greenwood Avenue, and the East End Garage around the corner on Archer Street.
 
The couple also owned the 750-seat Williams Dreamland Theatre, at 129 Greenwood Avenue, the first movie house for Black people in the city. It offered both silent films and live shows, and was also a community gathering spot.
 
Dr. R.T. Bridgewater was a physician with a practice in the Woods Building, at 101-105 Greenwood Avenue. He owned 17 rental houses and was also a community leader. The Tulsa Star, a Black-owned newspaper, called his home on the affluent North Detroit Street “palatial.”
 
Several women set up shop as entrepreneurs in the same building. Mary E. Jones Parrish, left, was a teacher and journalist who operated a typing school. Mabel B. Little ran the Little Rose Beauty Salon.
 
Susie Bell ran an upscale restaurant called Bell and Little Cafe with her brother, Presley Little, Ms. Little’s husband. It offered six-course meals that were written about in The Tulsa Star.
 
Buck Colbert Franklin, a lawyer, had an office inside a building owned by O.W. Gurley, one of Greenwood’s founders. After the massacre, Mr. Franklin provided legal services from a tent.
 
James Nails, shown here, and his brother Henry ran a shoe shop in the Gist Building at 121 Greenwood Avenue. The shop carried Black Swan records, and the family also owned a dance pavilion and skating rink in the community.
 
A. J. Smitherman, a journalist and civil rights activist, founded The Tulsa Star, which was headquartered at 126 Greenwood Avenue. The paper reported on stories of racial violence and advocated for the rights of African-Americans.
 
J.B. Stradford, shown with his wife, opened the posh 54-room Stradford Hotel at 301 Greenwood Avenue in 1918. It was considered among the nation’s best hotels for African-Americans at the time.
 
	Mr. Stradford and Mr. Gurley — who purchased large tracts of land in the early  1900s — were among the founders of Greenwood. They began building on the northern side of Tulsa beyond the railroad tracks, forming the bones of the city’s predominantly Black neighborhood that was separate from the white side of town.
 
	Greenwood was one of the few places in the country offering Black citizens — less than six decades out of enslavement —  a three-dimensional life.
 
By 1921, Greenwood had grown into a 35-block neighborhood with a bustling retail scene, as well as two schools, two newspapers and a hospital. Here, some of the community’s key places are shown in orange.
 
Booker T. Washington School, which opened in 1913 with 14 students, had moved into its three-story brick building in 1920. It would serve as a hospital and relief center after the massacre.
 
Mount Zion Baptist Church was among some half-dozen churches that burned. It was the city’s largest Black church.
 
There was also a small juke joint called Zulu Lounge owned by Isaac Evitt, who worked by day on a farm, but after dark, flung open the doors of Zulu.
 
	In the evenings, residents had their choice of entertainment. Survivor accounts that were relayed to relatives recall neighbors getting “gussied up” to gather in Greenwood, with Thursdays being big because of “Maids’ Night Out.” Black domestics, many of them live-in workers who cleaned the homes of white residents across town, were off that day.
 
	Many African-Americans migrated to Tulsa after the Civil War, carrying dreams of new chapters and the kind of freedom found in owning businesses. Others made a living working as maids, waiters, chauffeurs, shoe shiners and cooks for Tulsa’s new oil class.
 
	In Greenwood, residents held more than 200 different types of jobs. About 40 percent of the community’s residents were professionals or skilled craftspeople, like doctors, pharmacists, carpenters and hairdressers, according to a Times analysis of the 1920 census. While a vast majority of the neighborhood rented, many residents owned their homes.

	Segregation kept African-Americans from patronizing white-owned shops, and Greenwood thrived from community support of Black-owned businesses.
 
	“Black folks faced an economic detour,” said Hannibal B. Johnson, an author and the education chair for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission. “When they approached the gates to the wider Tulsa economy, they were turned away, so they ended up creating their own largely insular community.”
 
	The assaults on Greenwood raged over two days. The morning of June 2, 1921 revealed emptiness and ruin in every direction.
 
	Plumes of smoke hovered over the neighborhood. Ash coated the ground. Brick buildings had been reduced to bombed-out husks. And soon, the bodies of those killed would be stacked and discarded in mass graves and a river.
 
	It all began on May 30 with two teenagers in an elevator in the Drexel building in downtown Tulsa and morphed into a sexual assault accusation.
 
	Accounts vary about what happened between Dick Rowland, 19, a young Black shoe shiner, and Sarah Page, 17, a white elevator operator. One common theory suggests Mr. Rowland tripped and grabbed onto the arm of Ms. Page while trying to catch his fall. She screamed, and he ran away, according to the commission report.
 
	The next day, Mr. Rowland was arrested and jailed in the Tulsa County Courthouse. By that afternoon, The Tulsa Tribune published a front-page news story with the headline “Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator,” which essentially mobilized a lynch mob that showed up at the courthouse.
 
	Twice, a group of armed Black Tulsans, many of them World War I veterans, offered to help protect Mr. Rowland but were turned away by the sheriff.
 
	As the Black men were leaving the second time, a white man attempted to disarm a Black veteran, and a gun went off in the scuffle. That clash and others that day marked the beginning of what would become Greenwood’s armed destruction. Some white rioters were even deputized and given weapons by civil officials.
 
	Near dawn, the white mob descended on Greenwood. Black Tulsans fought back, valiantly defending their families and property. But they were woefully outnumbered.

	The mob indiscriminately shot Black people in the streets. Members of the mob ransacked homes and stole money and jewelry. They set fires, “house by house, block by block,” according to the commission report.
 
	Terror came from the sky, too. White pilots flew airplanes that dropped dynamite over the neighborhood, the report stated, making the Tulsa aerial attack what historians call among the first of an American city.
 
	The numbers presented a staggering portrait of loss: 35 blocks burned to the ground; as many as 300 dead; hundreds injured; 8,000 to 10,000 left homeless; more than 1,470 homes burned or looted; and eventually, 6,000 detained in internment camps.
 
	The neighborhood economy was destroyed. Two dozen grocery stores. Thirty-one restaurants. Four drug stores.
 
	Greenwood, where Black success embodied the American dream, was no more, suddenly, dreadfully wiped out.
 
	Greenwood would be rebuilt, and for a few decades, it would again thrive before falling to urban renewal and other forces. But that spring of 1921 unmoored and unrooted the neighborhood with lasting effects.
 
	Not long after the attack, shell-shocked survivors — who were blamed for the violence — returned home to ruin. Amid the charred remnants, they were forced to make an excruciating decision that would change family histories forever: leave and start over again somewhere else, or rebuild.
 
	They also faced another kind of white resistance: a fire ordinance intended to prevent Black property owners from rebuilding on their own and insurance companies that refused to pay damage claims.
 
	“Greenwood wasn’t a gift from anyone, it was created by the citizens of Greenwood who withstood the tragedy of 1921 and rebuilt it again,” said Scott Ellsworth, the author of the recently released book, “The Ground Breaking: An American City and Its Search for Justice.” “Greenwood is the story of resilience. It is the story of courage.”
 
	Those who stayed began stitching their lives back together almost immediately. They joined forces and began rebuilding homes and businesses. Within a day, C.L. Netherland, a massacre survivor and minister whose barber shop at 110 Greenwood Avenue was destroyed, purchased a folding chair, a strop and razor, and set up shop on a sidewalk.
 
	The massacre also claimed the Mount Zion Baptist Church, whose first service in its new building had been held less than two months earlier. The congregation’s hundreds of members had financed and built the $92,000 church over several years, according to “Black Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa’s Historic Greenwood District,” a book by Mr. Johnson, education chair for the centennial commission. It would have been easier to declare bankruptcy. Instead, church members rebuilt and dug in. It took an additional 21 years before the initial debt was repaid.
 
	The final insult of the massacre came in the silence. For decades, Tulsa deliberately ignored and covered up what had happened in Greenwood. Many descendants said they learned about the mob and the killings only as adults — and even then, some of the recounting was told in whispers.
 
	“You could see the pain in my grandmother’s eyes when she talked about what happened,” said LeRoy Gibbs II, 52, the grandson of Ernestine Gibbs, a massacre survivor who was 17 when the violence unfolded. “Before she would get too far, before it became too painful, she would shift and start talking about where we are today.”
 
	Some surviving business owners who built the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue had remarkable second chapters. Others, who struggled in the aftermath, had heartbreaking stories. The Williams family, among the most successful before the massacre, stayed and rebuilt.
 
	Mr. Smitherman, the civil rights activist who ran The Tulsa Star, eventually landed in Buffalo, where he became the publisher of The Buffalo Star (later named The Empire Star). He was among several Black Tulsans indicted for “inciting a riot,” and was exonerated posthumously.
 
	Ms. Parrish, the journalist who ran a typing school, stayed to chronicle the massacre. The two wealthy men who helped found Greenwood were hit hard financially. Mr. Stradford, who was indicted, escaped to Kansas and then Chicago. He never recovered his fortune. Mr. Gurley reportedly lost nearly $158,000 in 1921, or $2.3 million in today’s dollars.
 
	James Nails, who had opened a shoe shop with his brother Henry, rebuilt but never really recovered. He eventually left Tulsa.
 
	“He was really unable to carry on emotionally, psychologically,” Ms. Nails-Alford said. “You get your education, you work hard, you start businesses, you’re able to employ your family members and community members, and then you lose it all within hours. It takes away a man’s dignity.”
 In 1921, a white mob attacked the Greenwood district of Tulsa, killing hundreds of Black people and destroying the neighborhood. Justice has never been served. Can it still be today? 
	There is a pending lawsuit and ongoing discussions about how and whether to compensate the families of the Tulsa Massacre victims. No compensation has ever been paid under court order or by legislation.
 
	To this day, not one person has been prosecuted or punished for the devastation and ruin of the original Greenwood.
 Methodology The buildings, maps and data presented in this article are based on historical records. In as many cases as possible, multiple sources were used to confirm details like the location of businesses and residences. When there were differing accounts or information, The Times used what was cited by  the most sources. The number of killings in the massacre has been estimated to be up to 300, but a precise number was not available. Street addresses of some buildings were numbered in different ways, depending on the source. The 3-D model of Tulsa, Okla., was created using a series of both computerized and manual steps that transformed historical material into digital data. First, we took images of Sanborn insurance maps from 1920 and 1915 and used a process called georeferencing to align them to modern geography. The 1920 maps came from the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum and were used to reconstruct as much of Greenwood and downtown Tulsa as possible. The 1915 maps were from the Library of Congress and were used to fill in other parts of Tulsa, where 1920 maps were not available. Next, we wrote a computer program to extract the building outlines from those maps using a technique called machine learning. We also created an application to input the height information for each building from the Sanborn maps. Archival photographs and maps were used to create a detailed model of the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue. Buildings or parts of buildings without photographic reference are shown without details. The street grid was created by georeferencing a 1921 street map of Tulsa from the Library of Congress. We utilized a combination of optical character recognition and manual data entry to digitize the Polk-Hoffhine Tulsa City Directory from 1921, obtained from the Tulsa City-County Library. Those data were used to analyze and map businesses in Greenwood. Additional businesses were identified using the “Tulsa Colored Business Directory” in The Tulsa Star (1913-21) and The List of Losses published in “Events of The Tulsa Disaster” by Mary E. Jones Parrish. Owners of businesses on the 100 block were identified using The Tulsa Star and accounts of survivors and their descendants. To create the maps of the occupations of African-American residents in Greenwood, we analyzed 1920 U.S. census data from Ancestry.com for residents for which occupation data was recorded. Our analysis included residents who the 1920 census classified as Black or mulatto. We then mapped the homes of thousands of those residents using the 1920 Sanborn maps. Street maps from 1921 and Sanborn maps from 1939 were also used to help map addresses. The addresses of landmarks and other buildings were used to help determine the order of house numbers on a block. In some cases, Open Street Maps was used to locate addresses where the numbering system had not changed. Street name changes from the 1920 and 1921 city directories were incorporated in this process. We categorized occupations into three broad categories: professionals, skilled craftspeople and service workers. Records in which occupations were illegible, or were without a house number or clear address were excluded. While the Greenwood neighborhood boundary is not officially defined, the outline shown in this piece includes the predominantly African-American area shown in the 2001 state commission report as well as some additional areas, based on our analysis of census data.

Cinders in the Sky: The Legacy of the Tulsa Race Massacre · Cinders In the Sky · OKState Library Omeka S,"Fires burning along Archer and Greenwood during the massacre It was supposed to be a regular Wednesday morning: the sun would rise, the men would go to work, and the children to school. It was the first day of June and the Oklahoma summer heat was preparing to settle in, the cool breeze of spring banished to the past. With it being the middle of the work week, many families were already asleep, peacefully resting for another day of walking across the Frisco tracks to go work on the white side of Tulsa.  It would have been a normal Wednesday in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, too, if not for the angry white mob that descended upon the affluent Black neighborhood, otherwise known as Black Wall Street. On May 31, Dick Rowland, a Black shoe shiner, was arrested and detained on the top floor of the Tulsa County Court House for allegedly assaulting a woman, Sarah Page, on an elevator the day before. Because of the Tulsa Tribune’s sensationalist headlines, which exaggerated the circumstances of the event, white Tulsans congregated outside the building and pressured the sheriff to turn Rowland over to them—once the fabricated rumors had circulated around town, the white mob was eager to mete out their own version of justice: lynching. In Greenwood, when the Black community learned about what was happening outside the courthouse, some of the men marched over the railroad tracks with guns and ammunition to protect Rowland from the enraged horde desperate to find him. Soon enough, a standoff occurred in Tulsa between the Black community and the white community. But when an unclaimed shot rang out on the square, the anxious silence was shattered. Throughout the night and into the early hours of the morning, skirmishes between armed Black and white men took place on the borders of Greenwood before the white mob surged into the district and wreaked havoc on one of the only wealthy Black neighborhoods that ever existed in the United States. Fearful of a ‘Negro uprising’, an idea rooted in white supremacist ideology, the mob was soon aided by law enforcement officials and began setting Greenwood on fire. Planes circled over buildings and dropped burning turpentine balls on them. When the residents of Greenwood tried to flee their homes, some were shot down by gunfire from white men on board those planes. It was complete and total demolition: great plumes of black smoke choked the skies, parlors and restaurants were razed to the ground, Black citizens were captured and carted off to detention centers. The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 is categorized as one of the worst race massacres the country has ever seen, but has been majorly and purposely erased from the racial history of the United States. With the official death toll undetermined and the two hundred million dollars in economic damages still not repaired, the Greenwood District of Tulsa has never recovered from this attack. As we come upon the hundredth anniversary of this event, this exhibit is designed with an aim to explore and ruminate on the legacy of Greenwood before and after this crisis. What follows is an examination of what the district looked like before it was destroyed with reflections from those who lived through the massacre. We've also included a discussion on the language of how to frame this event, and resources for you to follow to help Greenwood. As you delve into this collection, we ask you to consider the history of Tulsa that is still being devastated by a government’s inadequacy to acknowledge their role in this massacre, and the racial trauma still apparent in the city today.",http://bit.ly/2RKm5Yj
DARIAH launches an annual Open Access Monograph Bursary for Early Career Researchers in Digital Humanities | DARIAH,"DARIAH-EU is launching an annual Open Access Book Bursary for the publication of one’s first monograph within the domain of Digital Humanities. The bursary will fund the Open Access publication of one monograph (or other long form of scholarship) per year.  By doing so, DARIAH-EU aims to further strengthen its long-standing commitment to pave pathways to the open research culture as it specifically pertains to arts and humanities disciplines and  to enable early career researchers, who are usually less privileged in institutional Open Access grants, to openly disseminate their first monographs in book series that are topically most relevant for their field of interest.  In terms of publishing venues, the bursary aims to support community-driven, fair players and therefore publication in a DOAB certified, fair Open Access publication venue with transparent pricing and in alignment with the SPARC Good Practice Principles with Scholarly Communication Services is set as an absolute eligibility criterion. * We use the term ‘monograph’ in a sense that it includes all long forms of scholarship. Exploring and supporting pathways into the open research culture for Arts and Humanities scholars is among the strategic commitments of DARIAH. One of the most complex challenges that scholars repeatedly voice in our advocacy practice is publishing one’s first monograph Open Access. Although there is an increasing support from science funders to extend their Open Access mandates to books, and to cover the costs of Book Publishing Charges, first monographs typically come from PhD dissertations, not externally funded research projects. Likewise, even though some of the research institutions have transformative agreements and/or institutional Open Access funds in place, these are not always available for non-permanent (or non-tenured) faculty members and usually do not cover the whole publication charges (BPCs) of a monograph published in the book series that is topically the most relevant to Early Career Researchers (ECRs).  This gap in the Open Access funding structures is not the only difficulty ECRs are facing when they wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. A well-known and frequently voiced challenge is that due to the very strong influence of the  prestige economy on the current academic tenure and promotion criteria, in most cases, young scholars still need to choose between their academic career prospects vs. publishing in fair Open Access venues (and all the societal, economic and scholarly benefits that come with it).  Therefore, it is clear that in parallel to our ongoing efforts and commitments of different kinds to change this situation for the better and enable the full transition of scholarly communication to responsible and community-driven means of Open Access on a systemic level,  we need to provide immediate help to ECRs to enable them to start from a strong position in terms of formal assessment but also to practice their ethical devotion and establish themselves as scholars who significantly contribute  to the fair and open research culture.  The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond.  For more details about the considerations behind the call, read here. Criteria regarding the APPLICANTS:  We follow the European Research Council’s definition of ECRs: Researchers up to 7 years after PhD, including doctoral candidates who did not earn their title yet. Criteria regarding the topic of the BOOK:  Criteria regarding the VENUE and FORMAT:  Criteria regarding the ACCESS CONDITIONS:  Details of the FUNDING:  Evaluation of the submissions is proposed to happen on two levels:  Applications should be submitted at oamonograph@dariah.eu List of the documents to be submitted: Should you have any further questions, please contact DARIAH’s Open Science Officer, Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra (erzsebet.toth-czifra@dariah.eu) for more details.  In June, an information session will be organised where applicants can ask further questions in a live chat.

The digital cultural record has a powerful role to play in both new and future strategies of creating new homes within the digital milieu. For example, the development and establishment of new digital archives around South Asian studies not only allows us to create new archives of the past but also to remember and commemorate the past differently. New maps transform how we understand space and place. And new digital comfort zones facilitate connections for those whose family and loved ones are only accessible online. Such interventions are essential to the recuperation of the integrity and soul of a people who have lived through and continue to shoulder the fraught and painful legacies of the British Empire and the communal bloodshed wrought by its demise. 
Building on the important history of digital humanities scholarship in South Asia and its diasporas that precedes this work, this book contends that South Asian studies is further positioned to offer a new genealogy of digital humanities, demonstrated through this assemblage of essays that reveal how the digital continues to shape notions of home, belonging, nation, identity, memory, and diaspora through a variety of humanistic methodologies and digital techniques. 
South Asian Digital Humanities thus demonstrates that postcolonial digital humanities has great possibility for creating some of the most important social justice scholarship in South Asian studies of the past century.

This book was originally published as a special issue of South Asian Review.
 The digital cultural record has a powerful role to play in both new and future strategies of creating new homes within the digital milieu. For example, the development and establishment of new digital archives around South Asian studies not only allows us to create new archives of the past but also to remember and commemorate the past differently. New maps transform how we understand space and place. And new digital comfort zones facilitate connections for those whose family and loved ones are only accessible online. Such interventions are essential to the recuperation of the integrity and soul of a people who have lived through and continue to shoulder the fraught and painful legacies of the British Empire and the communal bloodshed wrought by its demise.  Building on the important history of digital humanities scholarship in South Asia and its diasporas that precedes this work, this book contends that South Asian studies is further positioned to offer a new genealogy of digital humanities, demonstrated through this assemblage of essays that reveal how the digital continues to shape notions of home, belonging, nation, identity, memory, and diaspora through a variety of humanistic methodologies and digital techniques.  South Asian Digital Humanities thus demonstrates that postcolonial digital humanities has great possibility for creating some of the most important social justice scholarship in South Asian studies of the past century. It offers these essays as innovative interventions that complicate the digital cultural record while lodging a 'homelanding' for South Asians within it, positioning digital humanities as a method through which South Asian studies can strategically participate in the ongoing struggle for representation within digital knowledge production.

Roopika Risam (PhD, Emory University, Atlanta, USA) is an Associate Professor of Secondary and Higher Education and English and the Faculty Fellow for Digital Library Initiatives at Salem State University, USA, where she also serves as Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Digital Studies, and Coordinator of the Combined B.A./M.Ed. in English Education. Her research interests lie at the intersections of postcolonial and African diaspora studies, humanities knowledge infrastructures, digital humanities, and new media. Her first monograph, New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy, was published by Northwestern University Press in 2018. She is co-editing two volumes: Intersectionality in Digital Humanities with Barbara Bordalejo for Arc Humanities Press and The Digital Black Atlantic with Kelly Baker Josephs for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series (University of Minnesota Press). Along with Carol Stabile, she is Co-Director of Reanimate, an intersectional feminist publishing collective recovering archival writing by women in media activism. She recently received the Massachusetts Library Association’s Civil Liberties Champion Award for her work promoting equity and justice in the digital cultural record. Roopika Risam  Rahul K. Gairola  ""Pertinent, provocative, and powerful – the contributions in South Asian Digital Humanities align and advance, engage and intervene, together documenting, situating and resituating essential foundations, rich contexts and imperative perspectives that collectively inform this important area. Risam and Gairola have produced a commendable volume that situates timely dialogues and debates of the digital humanities in the historical, theoretical, and geographical contexts of postcolonial South Asia."" - Ray Siemens, Distinguished Professor of English and Director of the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL), Implementing New Knowledge Environments Project, and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada; and Global Innovations Chair in the Digital Humanities in the PVC Office of Education and Arts at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia   ""The digital record has an increasingly important role to play in the study of South Asian texts and cultures. Gairola and Risam's timely collection is an important intervention at the nexus of humanities and digital research techniques, articulating the need for methodologies that embrace de-colonial, feminist and intersectional perspectives to understand South Asian approaches to identity, nationality, colonialism, and diaspora. Covering literature, poetry, digital archives, and data infrastructures, this formidable volume provides a roadmap for interrogating issues of diversity, equity, and representation, while providing a necessary platform for digital postcolonial studies that is inclusive of South Asian voices and cultures.""  - Melissa Terras, Professor of Digital Cultural Heritage at the University of Edinburgh's College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; Director of the Edinburgh Centre for Data, Culture and Society; and Director of Research in the Edinburgh Futures Institute, Scotland   ""How do the digital afterlives of colonialism shape the formation of the digital record, and in turn, the cultural memory of humanity? In raising these questions, the contributors to this stimulating collection stake new and important terrain for the digital humanities. This collection of essays prises open rich veins of thinking around the digital turn and its implications not only for archives, pedagogy and research, but for the reproduction of silences, inequalities and broader workings of power. In revisiting the project of postcolonialism through the lens of the digital humanities, the gift of these essays is a re-spiriting of both. A politically engaged postcolonial scholarship must now contribute to envisioning a post-surveillance society, a politics of the disconnected subject and a differently connected global community."" - Melinda Hinkson, Director of the Institute of Postcolonial Studies, Melbourne; and Convening Editor of the journal Postcolonial Studies   ""Roopika Risam and Rahul K Gairola’s South Asian Digital Humanities is an important and timely volume offering a collection of innovative chapters which explore digital humanities in the South Asian context. The contributors come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and make innovative methodological and theoretical interventions. The field-defining introduction is followed by chapters that deal with digital politics, archives, literary texts and infrastructures. As an emerging discipline, I believe this will be a key text for digital humanities in South Asia."" - Rohit K Dasgupta, Senior Lecturer in Cultural Industries, University of Glasgow; and Visiting Fellow, Loughborough University, UK   ""South Asian Digital Humanities breaks new ground by drawing together established and emerging voices to set out an ambitious agenda and key issues for contemporary comparative research at the intersection of digital humanities, postcolonial and diaspora studies. In this impressive, innovative volume, diverse strands of critical debate are interwoven with wider historical and cultural trajectories, expanding our understanding of the possibilities of digital approaches to South Asian scholarship.""   - Paul Arthur, Vice-Chancellor’s Professorial Research Fellow; and Chair in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Arts and Humanities, Edith Cowan University, Western Australia   ""This volume truly innovates valuable scholarship. Roopika Risam and Rahul Gairola have done an admirable job in producing and curating a collection of essays that constellates diverse scholarly questions and insights that explore, and expand, the boundaries of postcolonial studies and digital humanities. With nuance, breadth, and depth, this volume critically responds to the ever-growing complexity of the increasingly digital contexts in which we work, think, and live. And perhaps just as importantly, this work reveals  possibilities of what contemporary digital humanities can be, as well as the vital contributions that emerge from innovative explorations like this. South Asian Digital Humanities is a building block for much more to come."" - Tyler Shores, University of Cambridge ThinkLab Manager; and Senior Research Associate, Intellectual Forum at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, UK. ©  Informa UK Limited, an Informa Plc company

Don’t Save the University—Transform It - Public Books,"What’s next for the digital humanities? And how might they be part of changing our collective futures? As universities across the country reach the end of this unprecedented year, Public Books and Digital Humanities at MIT present a four-part series examining the role of the digital in the life of scholars and societies. In this moment of global reckoning around issues of virological, ecological, historical, and moral concern, some of the field’s top thinkers here ask how digital media and methods continue to challenge, harm, sustain, and liberate—and they show how investigations into the relationship between the digital and the human have only just begun. —Stephanie Ann Frampton “Why read and write about literature while the world burns?” This question framed the fall 2020 Introduction to Graduate Studies in Literature course I taught for the master’s in English program at Salem State University—and also framed my own despair. Dispensing with the traditional survey of theory from Plato to Derrida, I introduced students to the history of English as a discipline, the shifts augured by the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s, and the possibilities offered by public and digital humanities. Yes, we read theory—Marxist, critical race, intersectional feminist, queer, disability, postcolonial, Indigenous, and abolition—with an eye toward the ways theory can position our work in the humanities as tools of resistance. If we are to ensure the long-term future of the liberal arts, we must reframe and rethink how we teach our students about the work that the humanities can do in the world. While the humanities have been dramatically sidelined in the past, such changes are crucial to demonstrating how valuing them anew offers us ways to reimagine the university as a site of justice. For public higher education, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the effects of a long decline in public funding. For years, colleges and universities have been eking out their continued existence through austerity measures: making small, often unstrategic cuts to budgets while attempting to maintain operations under increasingly tenuous circumstances. Now, they have been confronted with the financial challenges of the pandemic. These include refunds for auxiliary services like housing and dining, the cost of remote learning, the predatory educational-technology sector rushing to provide “solutions,” the cost of cleaning and testing protocols, and declining enrollments from a student population unsure of whether to take on the financial burden of postsecondary education amid a public-health crisis and the attendant economic crisis. Having already embraced austerity, colleges and universities are helpless before the pandemic’s new challenges. Indeed, there is nothing left to cut. Three stimulus packages from Congress have staved off imminent closure for most universities. But this has far from solved the longer-term institutional challenges of the untenable funding model of privatization, coupled with demographic shifts that leave particular regions vulnerable to the “enrollment cliff,” a projected drop in the numbers of students attending college that looms by 2026 due to the precipitous decline in the US birthrate from 2008 to 2011. Continuing the austerity model—that is, managing these issues through furloughs, layoffs, and program closures—remains on the table. Meanwhile, upper administration and boards struggle to carve out a new, more sustainable model for higher education, or face closure. As happens in such situations, attention to metrics like enrollments and credit hours prompts these leaders to identify “profitable” programs through their business-intelligence or other data-driven metrics. While this is valuable data, the tendency of boards and presidents to view it piecemeal—department by department, major to major, credit hour to credit hour—puts lower-enrolled majors in a precarious position. Failing to take into account the cost of delivery of programs, the role of service departments in supporting majors with higher enrollments through general education, or the ways liberal-arts programs subsidize other areas of the university often seems to lead to a familiar conclusion: the humanities and social sciences are areas to cut. Such cuts were once a tragedy; now, they are unconscionable. We need the insights of the humanities now as much as ever. Black, brown, and Indigenous people continue to face unabated violence and brutality, aided and abetted by legal and judicial systems. The racial and ethnic disparities in health care that have always existed in the United States have been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. Centuries of inequities born from Indigenous dispossession and racial capitalism have finally started to garner attention in the public sphere. Our moment is now. People in the United States must be prepared to work toward and demand an end to the ceaseless oppressions that so many face. In this urgent work, the humanities can help. But at a time where the humanities are under threat, how do we envision this work might continue? Some rightfully decry the effects of neoliberalism on higher education and harken to an idealized notion of the purpose of the university, grounded in the liberal arts, as offering access to education for all. These discourses often fail to consider that this ideal of the university never existed in the first place. In fact, the history of higher education in the United States has been beset by a crisis of purpose from its very beginning, as noted by theorists like Thorstein Veblen and John Thelin. Disciplines as we know them today only began taking their present shape in US higher education in the early 20th century. The first universities founded in the United States were not created for all but for a class of white men who would serve as self-appointed leaders of a new nation. It is true, of course, that shifts in demographics, the expansion of public higher education through the Morrill Land-Grant Acts in the 19th century, and larger numbers of Black, brown, and Indigenous people entering predominantly white institutions starting in the late 1960s have increased educational attainment over time. Nevertheless, disparities continue to exist. Universities have not effectively grappled with their roles in systemic racism, which plays out across the university: boards, administration, faculty, staff, curriculum, student life, athletics, and partnerships with corporations and the government. Nor have they begun addressing their historical and ongoing participation in Indigenous dispossession and genocide. If the university truly wants to justify itself through the liberal arts, the university must change—and the humanities must change too. This imperative requires reframing and rethinking the work that the humanities can do in the world: humanities engaged in and deeply connected to the material realities of oppression in our communities. Public and digital humanities have redefined the role of the humanities today. Scholars working in these areas, in collaboration with communities, are convincingly making the case for the value of the humanities, whether addressing historical inequalities or those of the present day. Projects like SlaveVoyages, for example, shed light on the history of slavery, while projects like COVID Black demonstrate how the legacies of slavery and racial capitalism shape how communities are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Equally crucial public- and digital-humanities work in Latinx, Native and Indigenous, and Asian American studies tackles links between the inequalities of history and the present. From the early work of scholars like W. E. B. Du Bois forward, Black, brown, and Indigenous scholars have been the vanguard of public humanities. Indeed, they have demonstrated precisely how the humanities can promote awareness and understanding of Indigenous dispossession and racial capitalism. However, universities have failed to appropriately value and recognize this work. The outputs of public- and digital-humanities scholarship look different from the monographs and journal articles highly prized by hiring and tenure and promotion committees. This work is often interdisciplinary and does not fit neatly within the discipline-based structures of academic departments, thus adding further challenges to its evaluation—and valuation. Scholars of color and Indigenous scholars, who often pursue this work, contend with these challenges of genre and interdisciplinarity on top of the routinized racialized and colonial inequalities they experience in the contemporary academy. Thus, the very scholarship that demonstrates the value of the liberal arts is undermined by our own faculty peers, who are unwilling to consider a more expansive notion of what constitutes “scholarship.” How, then, should these public humanities be valued? More importantly, how might the university reorient itself toward such humanities for the public? This requires that faculty advocate for recognition of interdisciplinary research and scholarship that takes untraditional forms—and to create opportunities for their students to do this work. I could see glimpses of this future in my fall 2020 class. In their final projects, students applied what we had learned to their own personal and professional goals in a genre of their choice. While some chose to explore the scholarly-essay genre, the project yielded a variety of results that demonstrate the value of digital and public humanities. These included high school curricula, public-humanities projects, and grant proposals for digital-humanities projects that engaged deeply with questions of race, sexuality, and disability. Many of these students, particularly those who are in-service teachers, are currently implementing their projects and seeing the work the humanities can do in the world. In the students’ final reflections on the course, the dominant theme was one of possibility—through the course they had learned that the possibilities of the humanities extend beyond academic audiences alone and are vitally connected to the most pressing social issues of our day. If we can communicate that sense of possibility in the humanities—to our students, to broader publics—and if we can make this work sustainable for the faculty who pursue it, we can begin addressing some of the racial disparities of workload within the academy and create new audiences for the humanities. The future of the university—and of the world—depend on it.   This article was commissioned by Stephanie Ann Frampton and Carolyn Dever.  Subscribe to RSS Keep Updated:",https://buff.ly/3ub55HS
"Robert Hollander, preeminent scholar of Dante, ‘pioneer’ of the digital humanities and Princeton alumnus, dies at 87","Robert Hollander, professor of European literature, and French and Italian, emeritus, and renowned scholar of Dante, died peacefully of natural causes at his family’s home in Pau'uilo, Hawaii on April 20. He was 87. Robert Hollander Hollander joined Princeton’s faculty in 1962 and transferred to emeritus status in 2003. His teaching and research centered on medieval Italian literature, with a focus on the work of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio.  “Professor Hollander was a central figure in the Department of French and Italian for 40 years,” said Tom Trezise, professor of French and Italian and department chair. “His substantial publications and related professional activity ensured a very prominent place for Princeton on the international map of Dante scholarship, and he was a pioneer in the creation of digital resources for the study of literature.” Trezise continued: “As a committed teacher of the humanities, Hollander touched the lives of countless Princeton undergraduates; as a dedicated graduate advisor and colleague, he helped to promote and enrich the careers of a great many fellow humanists. His passing marks an inestimable loss for the department and the University.” From 1975-98, Hollander was also a member of the Department of Comparative Literature, where he served as chair from 1994-98 and as director of undergraduate studies from 1975-78. He was also head of Butler College, one of Princeton’s six residential colleges, from 1991-95. Hollander’s efforts to improve the food options at Butler, starting with French bread and crisp apples, influenced Campus Dining offerings at all the residential colleges.  In 1986, he was awarded the University’s Howard T. Behrman Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Humanities. He was honored by the Alumni Council in 2007 with an Award for Service to Princeton. Over the course of his career, Hollander wrote or translated 25 books. He collaborated with his wife Jean Hollander, a poet who also taught literature and writing at Princeton, Brooklyn College, Columbia University and The College of New Jersey, to translate all three sections of Dante’s masterpiece to much acclaim. In 2008, they were honored with a Gold Florin award by the city of Florence, Italy, for their translation of “The Divine Comedy.” Born in Manhattan on July 31, 1933, Hollander received his bachelor of arts in French and English from Princeton in 1955. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1962. “I met Bob in 1960, when he bussed down from Columbia to precept in my literature course on European writers,” said Albert Sonnenfeld, a 1958 Princeton graduate alumnus in modern languages and literature, and a professor of French at the University from 1958-86. “He was an old Tiger, and so happy to return to his alma mater. He soon spotted the ‘spotty’ Italian program, and in one of those intense and admirable acts of sheer willpower Bob secretly vowed to master Italian and become the Dante specialist so lacking in our ranks.” Sonnenfeld added: “He worked so hard to achieve this goal and succeeded beyond anyone's imagining. His Dante course developed its own alumni, who at each Princeton Reunions would work up a canto or two for learned discussion.” Hollander’s Dante course at Princeton, affectionately referred to as “the organic chemistry of the humanities,” enjoyed a robust following from students and alumni. The dedication plaque inside room 111 in East Pyne Hall — home to many of Princeton’s language departments — reads, “Here, Professor Robert Hollander ’55 taught the Divine Comedy for 35 years: Generations of devoted students were inspired by his teaching.” Every year at Reunions, alumni of Hollander’s famed course gather in East Pyne to read from Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” a tradition that began in 1977 and has continued annually for more than four decades. For many years, Hollander took a group of Dante alumni to an 11th-century castle in Certaldo, Italy, to study Dante’s Inferno “in situ,” a memorable experience for all.  At Princeton, Hollander’s teaching and mentorship inspired undergraduate and graduate students, some of whom became lifelong friends and colleagues. “In the first conversation I ever had with Bob, my new sophomore adviser, I confessed to him that I was afraid I would never be able to write well,” said Frank Ordiway, a member of the Class of 1981 and a 1990 graduate alumnus in the comparative literature. “His simple response was, ‘Of course you will. I'll teach you.’ I remember feeling immensely grateful that he took my anxiety seriously, but I didn’t at that time grasp what he really meant when he went on to add something to the effect that it would be easier to write well if I actually knew something that was worth writing about and that maybe I should try a little Dante.” Ordiway, a former assistant professor and a former associate dean at Princeton, continued: “Years later, after having been his advisee for sophomore, junior and senior years and for my Ph.D. dissertation, I realize that I am still haunted and governed by that short, first conversation that was so quintessentially Bob and his philosophy: listen to your students and take them seriously, try to know and understand something before having an opinion about it, and you might as well start with Dante.” “It is difficult for me to think of one thing that Bob did or meant for me as a teacher and reader of medieval literature,” said Simone Marchesi, associate professor of French and Italian and a 2002 graduate alumnus. “He taught me so much of what I know about Dante and Boccaccio and shaped through his example so much of what I do every day.” Marchesi continued: “Perhaps the single most inspiring element in our relationship was the opportunity he gave me to witness as a graduate student and eventually as preceptor his unflinching devotion to undergraduate teaching, a teaching which combined absolute scholarly rigor with an unmatched openness to take everybody's contribution into serious consideration.” Outside of Princeton, Hollander’s impact on the field of Italian medieval literature and its scholars reached nationally and internationally, but in particular at Dartmouth College, where he taught as a visiting professor and established a digital Dante-focused humanities project before digital humanities existed. Hollander wondered how scholarly output could change if one could access all the Dante commentaries on a personal computer, an innovative idea in a time when very few humanistic disciplines had even begun to explore how computing could meet scholarly needs. With the help of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Hollander’s pilot program grew into the prestigious international Dartmouth Dante Project, a digital archive collecting scores of commentaries on the “Commedia.” Hollander also was the founding director for the Princeton Dante Project, which featured an annotated virtual edition of “The Divine Comedy,” and the Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America, an online journal for Dante scholars. Hollander received numerous awards including grants from Fulbright, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the NEH. He served as president of the Dante Society of America from 1979-85, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.  Donations may be made to the Professor Robert Hollander ’55 and Jean Hollander Scholarship fund.

Black Lives Matter Murals,"Black Lives Matter Murals Downtown Raleigh, NC  The following images are of murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, crafted by various artists, creators, and makers on brick and plywood. While made of various materials with different styles, these pieces of community-generated art all illustrate and amplify the important message that Black Lives Matter. Here, Slow looking is coupled with the murals to equip us with the opportunity to experience greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.  Slow looking with BLM Murals Slow looking was developed by Cogapp Labs - where they identify that the application is “A relaxing full-screen immersive experience.""

        Cogapp further expresses:
        
        “This relaxing full-screen immersive experience will slowly show your chosen image in detail. It takes a few rejuvenating minutes to complete, best enjoyed without distractions.”
        
        But how can Slow looking give us an opportunity to sit with images and art that was created with temporary materials with messages that carry a long and painful history and remind us how that history and socio-political inequalities are still present and dangerous today?
        
        The following images are from various artists, creators, and makers and their murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The Slow looking experience equips us with a greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.
        
        As Cogapp suggests, view and experience these images without distractions. But instead of passively observing this immersive experience, pay attention to what you are seeing, thinking, and feeling. How do these images surprise, shock, challenge, ignite you?

Hacking the Humanities | The New Yorker,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Elias Muhanna Last spring, I taught a literature seminar called “Before Wikipedia.” The subject was the history of encyclopedic writing, from ancient times to the present day. We read excerpts of Isidore of Seville’s ""Etymologies"" and Diderot’s ""Encyclopédie"" alongside works by Calvino, Sebald, and Flaubert. The word “Wikipedia” in the course title seemed to attract an unusual preponderance of science majors for a seminar in comparative literature. There were physicists and mathematicians, a cluster of coders, an engineer, a neuroscience major. I teach at Brown, which has an open curriculum that encourages diverse course enrollments, but I’d never found myself in a room with so many young scientists patiently waiting for me to begin a lecture that I wasn’t planning to give. In my experience, a successful seminar usually involves a mutiny quite early in the semester, when the students take over and my own voice is drowned out by the din of a crowded wheelhouse. This particular seminar’s discussions, however, began awkwardly. The silences I’ve learned to let hang in a classroom seemed unreasonably long. In the first week, I was further unnerved by an odd sound each time I’d turn to write something on the blackboard—the fluent skittering of fingers across twenty laptop keyboards, transcribing my scrawled words as though they’d be on an exam later in the week. Our first writing assignment was on the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder, whose ""Natural History"" is a font of Late Antiquity information on a stupefying range of subjects: the history of paper, portents provided by bees, the manufacture of purple dye, Alexander the Great’s famous dog. I asked the students to study Pliny’s writing style and try to mimic it in their own entry about a topic not treated in ""The Natural History_.""_ A week later, I had a stack of finely rendered facsimiles of Pliny’s clipped prose, on such topics as “coffee and coffee shops,” “the usual and unusual attributes of the hype man,” Chick-fil-A, and Kanye West. As I read through pages of perfect mimicry and snarky pastiche, I felt relief. The “two cultures” of the sciences and humanities were not so far apart, after all, or at least could be bridged by the lingua franca of pop culture. One student, Henry, a double major in computer science and mathematics, approached the assignment differently. Rather than trying to imitate Pliny himself, he found a text version of ""The Natural History"" on the Internet, analyzed its thirty-seven books using a natural-language processing toolkit, and then wrote a computer algorithm that generated English sentences using the discovered features of Pliny’s style. Here’s a sample from the passage that he submitted: The Pharusi, originally a Persian people, are said to be very greatly infested by pirates. And it will not be doubted that one or other of two things, full moon or the moon's conjunction in summer she must retire a long way off, and is gathered by the daughters of Hesperus. Ctesias states that in India there is a fish called the platanista with a dolphin's beak and tail, but 24 ft. long. Also great creatures resembling sheep come out on to the land for an unascertained reason, and they bud best under those circumstances, as otherwise it would make only leaves. Even so it is dragged ashore by more men hauling from the beach. Henry turned in the assignment even though the algorithm had failed to produce “any sophisticated themes or totally coherent sentences,” as he put it. His robot encyclopedist spoke in magnetic poetry phrases, which occasionally yielded uncanny reproductions of Plinian syntax but often fell flat. Optimizing the program by using something called Latent Semantic Analysis and something else called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo could be interesting, he mused, but would require more time than he was willing to devote to the project at the moment. After reading the assignment and reëvaluating the choices I’d made in my life, I slowly wrote the letter A in my grade book next to Henry’s name. My own programming skills were somewhat rudimentary and, without his cheerful explanations of the code, I would have been lost. There were two things, though, of which I was certain. First, a machine guided by an undergraduate had taught me something new about the expository style of an ancient Roman natural historian. Second, I had to hire Henry. During the previous months, I’d been learning a coding language while trying to develop a project about the aesthetics of classical Arabic poetry. My interests were similar to Henry’s: What could we learn about an author’s oeuvre by studying his or her tics and favorite clichés? What made a certain poem identifiably the product of a person, place, or time, from the perspective of syntax and vocabulary? After class one day, I asked Henry whether he would be interested in collaborating, though I felt sure that he had more interesting things to do with his time. Amazingly, he agreed. We spent the rest of the semester developing an algorithm that could detect different types of rhetorical figures in a large corpus of poetry. It flew through thousands of lines of verse like a drone over a wildlife habitat, snapping pictures of similes, allusions, and metatheses. The program, like the Pliny text generator, produced both epiphanies and duds. We spent a lot of time hand-checking the results, cleaning the data, tweaking a variable and rerunning the code. There were many crash courses on unfamiliar topics. I explained the basic principles of Arabic morphology and classical poetics to Henry, which he internalized effortlessly. Meanwhile, he explained terms like Hellinger distance, quadratic time, and high-dimensional space to me, while I blinked vacantly and asked him to repeat it all just one more time. By the end of the term, my hard drive was littered with raw text files, Python scripts, and data visualizations. I spent as much time scrolling through the pages of Stack Overflow—an online discussion forum frequented by coders and engineers—as I did sorting through the poems in our corpus. Every little victory was accompanied by two or three major setbacks. It was exhilarating. In the past decade, digital scholarship has gone from being a quirky corner of the humanities to a mainstream phenomenon, restructuring funding landscapes and pushing tenure committees to develop new protocols for accrediting digital projects. As the stakes have grown, so has an expectation about the role that the “digital turn” might play in revivifying the humanities, effecting a synthesis with the sciences, and other weighty causes. For many of its champions, the tinkering character of the digital humanities represents a kind of artisanal inquisitiveness, a hands-on, tool-building, map-making ethos that chafes against more abstract modes of humanistic inquiry. Our poetry project had less modest ambitions. Still, over the course of stitching together our digital monster, I found myself thinking about the future. Would my graduate students soon have to pass comprehensive exams in JavaScript and QGIS alongside classical Arabic? Would the trickling stream of humanities jobs become a swift-moving river, swollen with funding and public-private synergies? Every sunlit vision casts a dystopic shadow. On occasion, I’d bring up these issues with Henry, but he seemed puzzled by them. Our collaboration didn’t need to offer a panacea for the humanities to be worthwhile; it just needed to solve a problem. I could hear the silence hanging in the classroom again, aware that the undergraduate with his skittering laptop keyboard was now doing the talking, while I was the one grasping for answers.

Historian to bring more digital expertise to the digital humanities | Colorado Arts and Sciences Magazine | University of Colorado Boulder,"Skip to Content
 CU Boulder scholar is one of the newest recipients of the prestigious Mellon New Directions fellowship, which promotes continued interdisciplinary training Research can sometimes take scholars in unexpected directions, making certain lines of inquiry difficult to pursue—but not impossible, at least with more training. A prestigious fellowship recently awarded to a University of Colorado Boulder professor, though, allows for just that. Henry Lovejoy, an assistant professor of history, is the first scholar from CU Boulder to receive the Mellon New Directions Fellowship, an award from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that encourages professors in the humanities and humanistic social sciences to pursue additional necessary training outside their field of study, taking their research in new directions.    At the top of the page: Map of the precolonial African coast, 1828. Above: a combined visualization of 1828.   For Lovejoy, a historian who studies the African diaspora and has been working to map precolonial Africa, this $268,000 award will allow him not just to study the historical records and datasets of the Yoruba diaspora, but also to learn and understand the mathematical and spatial statistical models behind mapping.  Up to this point, Lovejoy relied on the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA) at CU Boulder and graduate students Vachan Daffedar Aswathanarayana (MCompSci’20), Zachary Mullen (PhDApMath’20), Ashton Wiens (MApMath’20), as well as Tiffany Beebe, Alexander Langer, Travis May and Megan Tocci, graduate students in history, to generate the data, develop new digital methods, perform analyses and unveil never before seen maps of part of precolonial Africa. With this fellowship, though, he’ll gain the technical skills necessary to do some of this work himself, including completing a GIS and Computational Learning certificate at CU Boulder; learn some spatial statistical modelling in consultation with Eric Vance, an associate professor of applied math at CU Boulder and LISA’s director; and continue working with a Canadian digital humanities company, Walk With Web, owned by Kartikay Chadha.  Ultimately, he plans to use these experiences to create a mapping-based interactive digital archive that will be freely available to the general public, potentially helping millions across North America, the Caribbean and Latin America gain a deeper understanding of African ancestry. We recently talked with Lovejoy about this award, what he plans to do with it, and the significance of interdisciplinary research: Q: “Congratulations on winning this award! What was your reaction when you found out that you won?” A: “I’m really excited because it’s a huge project to undertake and I think this is going to be really an interesting way to look at the African diaspora. I’m trying to map different points of conflict over time in precolonial Africa and line it up with slave trade data to understand the probabilities of African origins. So I think the impact of this fellowship is huge in terms of Africa ancestry in Africa and across the Americas, not just in the United States, but also in the Caribbean and Brazil and other places in Latin America. It brings a unique set of skills to be able to map uncertain geographies so that we can begin to plot the changes to different places alongside the movement of people.    The digital humanities are really on the cusp of a major breakthrough, and visualizations are really key to educating not only other researchers, students, but the general public.""  This project is endless in scope, but it will provide opportunities to develop new lines of research and recruit a diverse student body, who can help participate in such a massive endeavor.” Q: “In the proposal you mentioned creating an innovative, digital archive. So, how do you envision that looking or what are you envisioning including as part of that?” A: “What I’m envisioning is creating an animated map that shifts over time. So, every year we have numbers of slave ships departing the coast, and then internally there are different conflicts that happened over time. The hypothesis is that a large amount of people were enslaved during intra-African conflict and then were subsequently taken to the coast. By doing this, I will be connecting and layering spatial data into other open source archival information and datasets such as those related to slave voyages, or historical narratives of enslaved experiences over space and time. There is so much spatial data yet to be mined from primary and secondary sources. I believe that with these new skills, it will be possible to map a part of our planet in a historical period that has yet to be truly visualized. … Up until this point, it’s been really difficult because we haven’t really been able to put people, specific people, where they came from inland onto particular slave ships. Now, internally for Africa, it’s a lot more complicated, but there are more archaeological discoveries, so I think 3D technologies are going become really important, so you have a data point inland and begin to look at archaeological sites or connecting multimedia such as oral traditions and other interviews of people, local leaders and such who are talking about the history. Currently, archeologists are 3D scanning world heritage sites, so it will also be possible to take students to these difficult-to-reach places in Africa via virtual, mixed or augmented educational environments linked into a cartographic archive.      Henry Lovejoy   Alternatively, we can begin to reverse engineer all of this spatial data as well and begin to look at internal migrations within Africa, so there’s actually a very huge slave trade that went into a number of states that were forming in this period, and those slave populations were as much as the Americas combined. So, we actually have a lot of missing information about the lives of millions upon millions of people whose voices have been silenced through racism and discrimination.” Q: “Broadly speaking, what do you view as the significance of studying or adding this interdisciplinary education to what you already know?” A: “I think right now, the digital humanities are really on the cusp of a major breakthrough, and visualizations are really key to educating not only other researchers, students, but the general public.  Understanding maps is a really good way to help people locate themselves within their very complicated history. We tend not to think about Africa in the precolonial period. We look at the modern-day boundaries, but those are really only relatively recent since post-World War II. So you go back another 50 years, and that’s when the colonial map happened.  I’m working in the period where there are basically no maps that exist due to lack of written evidence among cultures that chose different ways to transmit their histories. So people often have a misconception that they might come from a place like Ghana or Angola, but those countries didn’t exist until the mid-20th century following decolonization. I think bringing in different types of visualizations to arts and humanities research is only going to be more and more important.”      Subscribe  Request Info  Give 275 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309

Why You Should Get a Master's in Digital Humanities,"Back to News Home We have dozens of flexible accelerated and graduate degrees available for adults — online, in-person or at one of our Wisconsin regional centers. Fill out this form to get more information. Do you have a story idea or media inquiry for Concordia’s Strategic Communications team? Send an email to news@cuw.edu. Digital Humanities is a rapidly growing field that blends life-long learning with the development of 21st century technological skills required for the global job market.  PC Mag referred to Digital Humanities as “the most exciting field you’ve never heard of” in a post back in 2017. If it’s so exciting, why haven’t we heard of it? Probably because the digital humanities are happening all around us.  Dr. Erin Laverick, Concordia University’s Digital Humanities Program Director, explains the emerging field this way: “The digital humanities prepares students not only in honing their content knowledge of a particular field such as history, theology, philosophy, English, and more, it also teaches them how to use and design digital tools in order to research and explore ethical, social, and religious issues relevant to local and global communities.” Dr. Laverick continues: “You may be a history major and love spending your time in the digital archives, looking through sites such as the Library of Congress. Have you ever considered who built that site that you use so often? People with knowledge of history and digital archival design all played a role in building the Library of Congress digital archive.” The advent of social media and smartphones, not to mention countless other digital advances, means that more humanities content is available to us than ever before. Studying the Digital Humanities prepares you to work in an integrated environment. In the information age, much of the work is in spaces where there is a need to develop strong content that is also data-driven. Debates in the Digital Humanities quotes Kathie Gossett from Old Dominion University, who asserts that the Digital Humanities need to be interdisciplinary. Digital Humanities breaks down barriers between local content areas, like English and history, and global areas, like humanities and computer science. In almost every field, understanding your user, your customer, or your intended audience is essential. As our world becomes more global and we communicate with more and more people, the ability to use multiple modalities in order to communicate is increasingly necessary. Dr. Laverick adds, “What excites me about the digital humanities is this field of study focuses entirely researching and digitizing to communicate with an audience.  The opportunities for exploration are endless and much needed in the job market and academy.” Students who study Digital Humanities at Concordia University take the classes 100% online. This program is 30 credits, and the courses are offered in 8-week blocks. One major benefit to the way this program is set up is that these classes are offered asynchronously, which means that you can take them at your own pace, with required check-in meetings.  You’ll be collaborating on projects with professors and coworkers throughout your time in this program. Some of these projects include using and creating digital tools, interacting with and creating digital texts, and conducting research. Dr. Laverick highlights in her webinar that you don’t need to be an expert computer scientist to develop an app as a part of an interdisciplinary team. On the other hand, if you like to code, you don’t need to be an expert in literary criticism to collaborate effectively with your colleagues. As you near the end of your program, you can choose between a practicum or a traditional thesis for your capstone project. Earning a Master's in Digital Humanities prepares you for work where the arts and sciences, the old and the new, intersect. The career paths are endless when you study Digital Humanities. Some possible options are museum curator, archival researcher, web and software design, digital pedagogical design, art and media specialist, grant writer, and more.  Steve Jobs once said of the software industry, “A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”  Those who have studied humanities know the value of engaging with different perspectives, analyzing culture, and studying language. Earning a Master’s in Digital Humanities from Concordia University will challenge your critical thinking as you prepare for a vocation of interdisciplinary collaboration in your community. —  If this story has inspired you, why not explore how you can help further Concordia's mission through giving.",https://blog.cuw.edu/what-study-digital-humanities-2163/

Coinage of the Roman Republic Online,"Coinage of the Roman Republic Online (CRRO) aims to provide in effect an online version of Michael Crawford's 1974 publication Roman Republican Coinage (RRC), which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types. Since its publication in 1974 there have been significant revisions to the dating of the series following the discovery of new hoards, but no attempt has been made to reflect these or make any other amendments to the published typology at this stage. The descriptions for these coins are based on the typology set out in RRC, but have been modified to meet the standards of the British Museum’s collection management system. Additional types not in the British Museum’s collection were added to this database by Richard Witschonke of the ANS. This project takes as its starting point the Roman Republican coins in the British Museum collection. These are published in a dedicated online catalogue prepared in 2010

We would like to acknowledge the contribution of Michael Crawford to the project and also to thank Michael Sharp of Cambridge University Press for allowing us to use the numbering system of Roman Republican Coinage. 
RRC Online is made possible by stable numismatic identifiers and linked open data methodologies established by the Nomisma.org project. Coin type data are made available with an Open Database License. All images are copyright of their respective institutions. In November 2020, CRRO is beginning to enter a second phase of advanced functionality, integrating die links established by Richard Schaefer in the Roman Republican Die Project. Where applicable, the pages for RRC numbers have been enhanced by displaying die
    links in tables and network graphs, with the die pairings and numeric counts of specimens downloadable as CSV files for further analysis in other
    statistical platforms. New specimens from private collections and auction catalogs are being made available in CRRO through the ANS' SITNAM database. Eventually, this will enhance the coverage in CRRO to some 300,000 Roman Republican coins.

Play with Virtual Movable Books | Learning as Play,"This site allows users to “play” with virtual reproductions of rare items that are too fragile to allow frequent use of the originals. The items are represented as interactive lift-the-flap books that can be manipulated in the same manner as the originals. Metamorphic pictures are made on a long sheet of paper that is folded twice horizontally so that the top and bottom meet in the middle and create two flaps, and then folded and cut vertically to create a number of panels.

Research institute aims to bring diverse ‘new storytellers’ to digital scholarship | Nebraska Today | University of Nebraska–Lincoln,"May 21, 2021        ·
      5 min read     The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is preparing to welcome 23 emerging scholars from minority-serving institutions for an intensive, interdisciplinary institute that will explore the platforms, tools, designs and ethical questions surrounding digital humanities projects in ethnic studies. “New Storytellers: The Research Institute in Digital Ethnic Studies” will begin May 24 and be held virtually over 10 weeks. It is one of the only digital humanities research institutes in the United States focused on digital research in ethnic studies. It was made possible by grant funding from the American Council of Learned Societies and support from the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and the Institute for Ethnic Studies. 






          Huettl    


“New Storytellers” was organized by a team of scholars at Nebraska committed to bringing new voices and diverse stories and projects into the digital humanities sphere. Leading the effort are co-principal investigators Joy Castro, Willa Cather Professor of English and ethnic studies and director of the Institute for Ethnic Studies; Margaret Huettl, assistant professor of history and ethnic studies; Jeannette Eileen Jones, associate professor of history and ethnic studies; Ken Price, Hillegass University Professor of American Literature and co-director of the CDRH; and Will Thomas, Angle Chair in the Humanities, professor of history and associate dean for research and graduate education in the College of Arts and Sciences. 






          Thomas    


“We want to have an open and mutual and developmental exchange at the national level, to raise the visibility of digital humanities in ethnic studies,” Thomas said. “In the digital space, we have a lot of work to do to bring out these new stories.” The co-principal investigators are being assisted by Claire Jimenez, doctoral student in the Department of English with a graduate specialization in ethnic studies and a graduate certificate in digital humanities. In addition, CDRH staff are contributing to the institute, including Karin Dalziel, digital development manager and designer; Laura Weakly, metadata encoding specialist; Brett Barney, research associate professor; Kaci Nash, research associate; Greg Tunink, programmer/analyst; and Sarita Garcia, junior developer. 






          Price    


The 23 fellows, selected through a competitive application process, will attend sessions led by digital humanities scholars from across the United States. The fellows identified a digital humanities project in their application, and the institute’s goal is to help the scholars develop these projects through a variety of session topics. “We have people at different stages in the evolution of their projects. For some, it’s an idea that has just started, and for others, they’re in process,” Price said. “Through the institute, they’re going to be exposed to the big-picture plenary addresses, down to the very specific technical advice.” 






          Jones    


A key component of the institute is growing an intellectual community. There are networking sessions included in the syllabus and an opportunity for peer-to-peer mentoring. “We are trying to foster and create relationships,” Jones said. “If we cultivate those relationships now, they may — maybe not right away, but down the road — become collaborators and have a professional community to lean on.” Preparation and planning for the institute has been ongoing since 2017, when the co-principal investigators began visiting eight minority-serving institutions across the country — historically black colleges and universities, Native-serving institutions and Hispanic-serving institutions — to gather information about what faculty wanted and needed in terms of digital humanities. In 2018, the CDRH held its annual forum on the topic of “New Storytellers,” with many of the faculty members from minority-serving institutions in attendance. Following the forum, the Nebraska team planned a two-week, in-person institute for 2020, which was postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Institute leaders reworked the schedule into a 10-week course for 2021 and invited back the fellows originally selected. All were able to attend. The change to a virtual format, and a longer calendar schedule, allowed for some extra guest presenters to be added, including editors of scholarly journals and program officers from funding organizations, including the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. 






          Castro    


Castro said there is a pedagogical advantage to a longer format, as well. “If you’re thinking about a project in a focused way for 10 weeks, even if it’s not all day, it is still at the forefront of your mind,” she said. “As you continue to develop the project, you’re going to have questions arise that might not have come up in a hyper-concentrated two-week schedule. You have more time to think it through, build on it and test things out.” The 10-week period also will give scholars a long runway to get new projects off the ground. “It gives the participants time to embed their project in their home institution, and if they run into a technical problem or some questions, then they have time to come back to us, talk to us about it and then return home and tackle it one more time,” Price said.

 Fellows will receive ongoing mentoring from the institute’s organizing team, as well as technical assistance when needed from CDRH. The team plans to make the institute an annual offering and is seeking continued funding. “We would like to see this independently funded and permanent,” Castro said. “Based on the demand we saw when people applied, this could run every year, and this is a dynamic field that is only growing.” Thomas added: “Holding this institute at the University of Nebraska is putting it in the lead of digital humanities programs and centers around the country and around the world. We want to maintain that lead and sustain this project, as well as put it into a larger framework for race and ethnic studies inquiry, research, scholarship and publication at the university.” Some parts of this site work best with JavaScript enabled.",https://bit.ly/342fiLZ

U of T Mississauga researcher leads new Critical Digital Humanities Initiative,"UTM  Imagine being able to listen to Kimberly Nixon describe, in her own words, being turned away as a volunteer at a Vancouver rape crisis centre because of her status as a trans woman. Or having an app to report on corporate pollution near and on Indigenous lands in Canada’s North.  The University of Toronto’s Elspeth Brown says these are just two examples of how critical digital humanities research that focuses on questions of power and inequality can have a big impact. Brown, a professor in U of T Mississauga’s department of historical studies, was recently awarded $3 million in funding for the next three years to make the university a global leader in this area. “It’s about building a network of faculty members who do critical digital humanities at U of T,” says Brown, who is director of the new Critical Digital Humanities Initiative (CDHI). Brown, who is also director of the university’s Digital Humanities Network, led the tri-campus initiative that will bridge the humanities with digital technology tools, with a particular focus on anti-racist, feminist, queer and de-colonial scholarship and researchers.  Brown describes digital humanities as an interdisciplinary field that bridges the humanities and computational or digital studies. “We define the digital humanities broadly to include all the communities and methods, tools and platform-based approaches often associated with digital humanities, such as archiving, digitizing, curation, analysis, coding, editing, visualization, mapping, modelling, versioning and prototyping,” she says. “We have an inclusive agenda that encompasses interpretive or theoretical work on digitality.” Brown says she saw a need to support this area of research at the university when she started putting together the initiative’s proposal. “Once we started to really get down to the nitty gritty, we realized that actually most people doing digital humanities at U of T are doing this version of critical digital humanities that is collaborative – often public-facing – that addresses questions and social inequality and power,” Brown says. Over a 15-month period between 2019 and 2020, Brown met with researchers, chairs, and deans across the three campuses to generate support for the initiative. She also met with digital humanities faculty researchers across campus to find out what they needed and wanted for support. “I would meet with them as a team and try to ask questions like, ‘What do you need to help support your research? What are the kinds of things that you wish we had in place that would enable you to reach your goals?’”  Brown says the initiative will make an impact on humanities research, and academia in general, because it opens the door to team-based research. “That’s a very different way for scholars to work,” she says. “For these kinds of projects, you are required to (work as a team) because no one person has all the expertise and knowledge.” She says that the initiative also highlights the importance of public engagement in research. “(It’s) breaking down the barriers between the universities and outside communities, and working collaboratively with researchers, community partners, and communicating with the broader public.” In addition, she says CDHI will support research projects that are part of a broader movement to reach the public –  an audience that a peer-reviewed journal might not necessarily reach. Brown’s own LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory, which makes LGBTQ+ oral histories more accessible online, is having an impact on young people in the LGBTQ+ community. “I definitely think this kind of work has a major impact on people's capacity for resiliency in the present, and to engage with other people – who are in this case queer and trans,” says Brown. “But it's also true for many of the other projects that we're supporting through critical digital humanities.” Caleb Wellum, program officer for the initiative, says that the research supported by the CDHI will help graduate students in the digital humanities learn hands-on skills that will be needed in the job market. “One of my hopes is that it will encourage a rethinking or modernization of graduate student training in the humanities at U of T,” he says. The initiative has been funded by U of T’s Institutional Strategic Initiatives portfolio and included contributions from U of T Mississauga, U of T Scarborough, the Faculty of Information and the Faculty of Arts & Science.   Share this page  Get faculty and staff news delivered straight to your inbox.

AO3 – The mad woman in the open source attic? | Open World,"Earlier in April when I was preparing my keynote for the FLOSS UK Conference, which focused partially on issues of structural discrimination and lack of equality and diversity in open knowledge and open source communities, it struck me rather forcefully that there is one hugely successful OSS initiative supported by an almost entirely female developer and user community that rarely, if ever, gets spoken about in open knowledge and tech circles. That initiative is Archive Of Our Own. Hands up who’s heard of it? I suspect many of you won’t have heard of it. I know a few of you will have. I bet one or two of you won’t admit it. So why the reticence?  Run by the not for profit Organisation for Transformative Works, the Archive is a massively successful project that has been sustained by a hugely diverse community of volunteers for almost ten years now. It’s about as open as anything could possibly be. Why are we not singing its praises from the rafters? Why is AO3, as it’s commonly known, the mad woman in the open source attic? Some of us know it’s there, but no one really wants to talk about it. The reason for this reticence, is also the reason for the Archive’s success. AO3 is a repository of transformative works, otherwise known as fanfiction. I’m not going to debate the validity of fan works as a creative endeavour here, there is plenty of scholarly discussion on that point in other disciplines such as sociology and media, however I really do want to talk about why we don’t acknowledge AO3 as a hugely successful open project founded on the principals of equality, inclusion and diversity. Why aren’t we celebrating it and learning from it? The success of AO3 is nothing short of staggering. Built on the Ruby on Rails framework, the archive is an open source platform developed, built and maintained by an army of volunteers, the vast majority of whom are women. The project is funded by subscriptions and donations; there is no foundation funding, no sponsorship, no advertising revenue. Indeed AO3 was originally created as a haven to protect fanworks from being monetized by unscrupulous commercial ventures who sought to turn fan labour into profit for their own gain. The Archive itself now has one and a half million users and hosts around four million individual works. It’s free and open to everyone, all user accounts are pseudonymous, and at no point are users required to reveal personally identifying information. In order to manage those four million works AO3 maintains probably the only large scale community generated tagging system that I’ve ever seen working in practice. And it’s all made possible by a large community of tag wranglers who manage the free text tags provided by users. And as if all that wasn’t enough, the Organisation for Transformative works also publishes a peer reviewed open journal, Transformative Works and Cultures, maintains the Fanlore wiki to preserve the history of transformative works, it provides voluntary legal advice to creators to protect their works from legal challenge, and it has an active project, Open Doors, to absorb and curate other fan archives elsewhere on the web that are threatened by obscurity, obsolescence or deletion. It’s an astonishing achievement, but it’s an achievement that many passionate open advocates know nothing about, and, if I’m being honest, that is something that’s pissed me off enormously for years. So I was absolutely over the moon when I spoke to Claire Knowles, Library Digital Development Manager at the University of Edinburgh, at the recent Digital Day of Ideas (always a thought provoking event that pushes the boundaries) and she told me that Casey Fiesler, a member of OTW’s legal committee, would be presenting the opening keynote at this year’s Open Repositories Conference in Bozeman, Montana. Earlier this week I listened to Casey’s keynote through the conference livestream and was blown away by her talk.  Casey did an amazing job of communicating just what an important achievement AO3 is and how we can learn from its success. Giving an overview of the history and development of the Archive, Casey pointed out that AO3 is an example of amazing design, created for a community that already existed. The open software was designed and built entirely by women, which is remarkable given the small number of women in the open source community. And she concluded her keynote by asking Is there something here that’s the key to making open source more welcoming to women? I don’t know. What I do know is that if you love something enough you can build your own thing and make it work. AO3 is a great example of a successful open repository but it’s an even better example of the power of community and everything that can come out of it. The recording of Casey’s keynote isn’t online yet, though I’m sure it will be soon, but in the meantime, I’ve captured my live tweets from her keynote here; Growing Their Own: Building an Archive and a Community for Fanfiction. Many thanks to Casey for her amazing keynote and to the Open Repositories Conference Committee for inviting such an inspiring speaker. Pingback: The Archive of Our Own is now a Hugo nominee.

Domains21: Michigan State University Enmeshed in the Cloud | bavatuesdays,"I’ll be posting sessions from Domains 21 over the next several weeks as a way to keep OERxDomains21 as close to my blog heart as possible, you’ve been warmed and warned! 🙂 In this session Kathleen Fitzpatrick and Scott Schopieray discuss the ways in which the MESH Research Center at Michigan State University has been using Reclaim Cloud as a sandbox for a wide-variety of applications that will not run in cPanel cleanly. With the ability to quickly stand-up applications like Mattermost, Etherpad, Jitsi, and Discourse, the Cloud might be understood as the requisite hosting environment for a whole new class of next generation applications built in Java, Node.js, Ruby, Go, and, as is increasingly the case, packaged up as a one- Docker instance.  In addition, this session frames the importance of universities and colleges reclaiming control of their infrastructure as a means to not only explore the edges, but to ensure a degree of data sovereignty for the broader community. As with several other sessions in the Domains21 track, there is a growing sense urgency around exploring open source tools for a degree of platform independence for the broader academic discourse to remain viable.

Published online by Cambridge University Press: 
22 April 2021 As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities in a broad sense. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archive collections to support digital pedagogy. Related activities of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA), its Digital Humanities SIG and the ARLIS/NA in the Humanities Commons are also discussed.  As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities (DH) in a broad sense. New art information professionals are expected to conversant with digital humanities.Footnote 1 A proliferation of digital projects created by art and architecture librarians reflects this, as do the position titles of art information professionals, the number of art libraries participating in inter-institutional digital GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) initiatives and the publications produced by the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA). The Society's digital humanities initiatives are not exclusive to its special interest group dedicated to digital humanities, the DH SIG, now nearly a decade old.Footnote 2 Members of many groups, sections, and divisions across ARLIS/NA spearhead and contribute to DH projects, with the collaborative underpinning of digital humanities supporting inter-institutional engagement and innovation. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archives collections to support digital pedagogy.  The Humanities Commons is a platform for open information sharing in the Humanities. Based on the open-source Commons in a Box software, the Humanities Commons began as a project of the Modern Language Association (MLA) and is now maintained by Michigan State University.Footnote 3 In 2018, the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons Planning Task Force recommended that the society adopt Humanities Commons as a “network for facilitating communication and collaboration between members of scholarly communities.”Footnote 4 Subsequently, an Implementation Task Force was formed to develop a branded portal for ARLIS/NA on the Humanities Commons. ARLIS/NA is expected to join the MLA, the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES), the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) and the College Art Association (CAA), on the platform as a participating organization later this year. A dedicated area for ARLIS/NA members and ARLIS/NA publications will encourage engagement both within and across organizations and disciplines in the Humanities. Two projects, A Digital Humanities Bibliography and the Digital Art History Directory, demonstrate the promise of the Commons.  A Digital Humanities Bibliography was recently deposited in CORE, the Humanities Commons shared repository. CORE provides a permanent URL with digital object identifier (DOI), subject and keyword tagging and a download count. In three months there were 235 downloads of the DH Bibliography, which includes 1500 citations, organized alphabetically, on topics including but not limited to the arts.Footnote 5 Documents in the CORE repository can be affiliated with multiple groups (such as Digital Art History and Digital Humanists) as well as a particular organization (such as the upcoming ARLIS/NA Commons) to improve discoverability. The traditional bibliography, even for a newer topic like Digital Humanities, remains a useful tool, and enjoys a wider audience and persistent access in the shared repository.  In addition to structured, open access to publications, it is possible to develop custom projects on the Humanities Commons. The ARLIS/NA Commons will soon feature the Digital Art History Directory (DAHD), a project led by Michelle Wilson, Samantha Deutch and Roger Lawson and supported by the ARLIS/NA Cataloging Section, Digital Humanities SIG, Web Archiving SIG and Systems Librarian Working Group. The DAHD is a dynamic resource “for discovering, sharing and researching digital art history (DAH) projects. The DAHD is intended to be the largest, most comprehensive and inclusive collection of information on digital art history and to function as a tool and living resource, rather than a static publication.”Footnote 6 Projects submitted for inclusion, which may range from best practices to data sources to digital projects and bibliographies, will undergo a review process prior to publication. A well-designed, user-friendly interface, along with a locally created taxonomy for project types, and subject and keyword searching make the directory an indispensable resource for discovering digital art history. In the deluge of digital information, this project again underscores the place of traditional library work, such as compiling bibliographies, directories and indices, in the digital age. Here changes in technology do not usurp the bibliographer's role; rather they permit bibliographers to facilitate access to non-traditional resources, often not published commercially and not indexed in subscription databases.  The flexible platform of the Humanities Commons, which is built on WordPress, hosts initiatives of different scales, ranging from a single document to the interactive directory discussed above, as well as a group organizing space. The DH SIG will begin its transition to the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons soon after launch by migrating its WordPress website. With shared interests and an informal organizational structure, the DH SIG provides a welcoming place for members exploring digital humanities for the first time, for discovering useful tools and projects and to incubate ideas and collaborations. The DH SIG plans to adopt communication channels available in the Commons including a calendar, social networking features and collaborative document and file sharing. The centralized tools will improve connection between members, streamline the wide variety of communication outlets employed intermittently over the last decade and allow members to publicize their projects on the platform where they are hosted.  Another initiative where a wide variety of organizations and librarians in many roles, including art librarians, have come together is Wikidata, the linked data repository behind Wikipedia and other Wikimedia initiatives. The Wikidata Pilot Project of the Program for Cooperative Cataloguing (PCC) explores identity management through Wikidata. Participating libraries meet monthly for training and discussion of Wikidata or linked data topics. Libraries who have joined the PCC Wikidata Pilot with projects focused on art-related linked data include the Frick Art Reference Library, Michigan State University, the National Gallery of Art, the New Mexico State Library, New York University, Northwestern University, Oklahoma State University, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Smithsonian. Linked data will be created on topics including artists, specifically, from Black, Latinx and Native American communities; artists’ files; art historians/historiography; works of art, including portraits, manga, and campus public art and architecture; archival and special collections; art materials; exhibitions; and government publications.Footnote 7  It is not necessary to participate in the PCC Wikidata Pilot Project to work with Wikidata or linked data. Vanderbilt University and the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, have developed their own projects to share metadata from art museum collections with Wikidata.Footnote 8 Another pilot project exploring bulk transformation of structured data from ContentDM into linked data is OCLC's “Transforming Metadata into Linked Data.” The project report confirms the value of linked data for discovery and visualization, but also notes the difficulties of reconciling data without some manual input and the long-term timeline for the shift to linked data.Footnote 9 Awareness of these linked data projects is important even for librarians who do not catalogue or otherwise create datasets. Once in Wikidata, this data may be used for visualizations, textual analysis or provide access to public domain images useful to art researchers. There will be opportunities to learn about linked data at the ARLIS/NA 49th Annual Conference, which will feature a presentation on linked data from the Frick Art Reference Library and the National Gallery as well as a workshop for beginners, Wikidata for Art Librarians, hosted by the DH SIG and conducted by Will Kent of the Wikimedia Foundation.  The rich data available in Wikidata populates network visualizations and informs a variety of other DH projects. Additionally, conversations about representing communities and languages in linked data and the critical approaches necessary to describe them equitably align with interdisciplinary humanities inquiry. DH visualizations provide an avenue for communicating the complex contextuality of these issues to a wider audience.Footnote 10  Wikidata connects data creators with one of the widest audiences available – users of Wikipedia. Names of artists, works of art, exhibitions, and publications, can supplement and support contributions to Wikipedia. For example, the “info boxes” or “knowledge panels” displayed in both Wikipedia and Google searches display data from Wikidata.Footnote 11 Adding exhibition histories and citations to Wikidata can help establish artists from marginalized communities as “notable” for inclusion in Wikipedia.Footnote 12 ARLIS/NA members have been active as Wikipedia editors, not only in the DH SIG, but across the organization. Recent edit-a-thons for the Art + Feminism Wikipedia group have included the National Museum Women in the Arts Library focusing on women artists of color; Respect Her Crank: A Go-Go Herstory Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon from the Smithsonian Libraries; The Walker Art Center editing articles of womxn artists in the Walker's exhibition Don't let this be easy, among many others. Additionally, Yale and MIT Libraries held the BIPOC in the Built virtual Wikipedia edit-a-thon, a week-long event to create Wikipedia pages for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) artists, architects and designers. No experience is needed to participate in a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and extensive guidance on organizing a local event is available from Art + Feminism and Wikimedia.Footnote 13  Digital skill building meets visual literacy in Building Visual Literacy: A Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Teaching from University Art Collections. Created by Washington and Lee University's University Collection of Art and Art History in partnership with the University Library, these object-based lesson plans “cultivate visual literacy abilities to interpret and evaluate the world around us—important tools for student success in any discipline or career field.”Footnote 14 Photogrammetry of Uncle Tom's Cabin Vase, one of the toolkit lessons, offers a user-friendly overview of this technique for creating a three-dimensional model of a ceramic vase, paired with suggestions for teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Similarly, a Drew University librarian Danielle Reay developed a three-dimensional model to teach visual literacy skills. Using historic documents from the university archives, Reay virtually reconstructed a demolished library building for a research skill building exercise for architecture students.Footnote 15  Since over the past months it has not been possible to travel for museum fieldtrips or the site visits integral to the architecture studio, virtual reality may be evolving from interesting technology into technological necessity. A pilot project at the Frances Loeb Library of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design supported virtual site visits for architecture students in two studio courses. Despite the short turnaround time for the project, site documentation, including videos, was collected for reuse in future courses through the library collections portal.Footnote 16 In this way, DH enhanced the traditional library role of collection development and efficient access to resources. The University of Calgary developed a virtual reality (VR) artist in residence program for art and architecture students. It is an innovative combination of a badge program and a residency. Students receive training, access to VR equipment and applications and other support needed to deliver a shareable VR project by the end of the residency.Footnote 17  Additionally, several three-dimensional collections have been digitized in two dimensions for the first time. The ARLIS/NA 2020 conference presentation Reimagining Unique Collections through Digitization highlighted an 1893 World's Fair panorama captured in glass lantern slides at the University of Kansas, textiles and garments from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Textile Resource Center collection, and fiber arts artist files from The Friends of Fiber Art International Artist File Collection of the American Craft Council.Footnote 18 The Frances Loeb Library and the Rhode Island School of Design Fleet Library launched Material Order Search, a shared digital library of design materials. Robust search and browse features are built on a custom taxonomy for materials that includes production company, usage, composition, and sensorial properties, for example, “touch - rough” to describe the tactile sensation of a particular texture.Footnote 19  Traditional digital collections of visual resources centers and archives are being reimagined as digital humanities projects in increasingly creative ways. The Yale Arts Library brought a traditional art history visual resources collection into more than a thousand dimensions with PixPlot.Footnote 20 PixPlot visualizes a complex neural network using common three-dimensional game design techniques. The result is a highly interactive visualization tool that helps users see connections between objects in new ways. Images from the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale Center for British Art and the Medical Historical Library have also been visualized in PixPlot.  IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is the image display and sharing technology behind many recent innovative visual digital humanities projects, including PixPlot.Footnote 21 Several recent IIIF applications from the Getty Research Center stand out: 12 Sunsets, the Research Collections Viewer and the Animal Crossing Art Generator. 12 Sunsets visualizes more than 60,000 of Ed Ruscha's Sunset Strip photographs. Website visitors maneuver Ruscha's pickup truck along Sunset Boulevard or search by year, time of day, street, tag or keyword to explore the photographs. The Research Collections Viewer provides a more traditional archival view of the same collection and several others. The simple interface contains a novel visualization of the collection hierarchy as well as metadata, permissions, the image comparison viewer, and IIIF manifests. The Animal Crossing Art Generator takes artworks out of the museum—The Getty or any museum that provides IIIF images—and into a popular game by Nintendo called Animal Crossing.Footnote 22 Players find a IIIF manifest URL, paste it into a form on the Getty site to generate a QR code, which will download the artwork onto a wall or an easel inside the game.Footnote 23  In addition to the novel applications noted above, IIIF may be used for traditional art historical image comparison within a single collection as well as across institutions. At the Henry E. Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, Mario Einaudi trains schoolteachers to use ContentDM with IIIF and Mirador to provide dynamic presentations in the classroom. For example, a zoomable map of Chinatown may be contextualized with a detail of a neighborhood as well as historical maps, street views, photographs or objects simultaneously.Footnote 24  As the foundation of many digital humanities projects, digitized collections are included in this overview of recent digital humanities initiatives alongside innovative approaches to manipulating digitized images in the humanities. Despite established workflows and technological advances that have made digitization efforts and digital exhibitions routine, many barriers remain, and many collections are not yet digitized. The authors of Reimagining Unique Collections mention challenges such as communication with vendors; rights clearance; and ongoing server and site maintenance. Digital preservation remains perpetually on the horizon. As Meghan Lyon has observed in her assessment of digitized artists’ archives, “challenges include providing access to an intelligibly navigable and publicly engaging platform; maintaining cohesion, context, and credibility; balancing copyright, privacy, and access; and facilitating cross-institutional collaboration.”Footnote 25  Many digitization projects are noteworthy simply as unique digital surrogates, and many have overcome significant impediments, often without a budget. In this sense, small-scale projects brought to fruition merit recognition alongside more innovative, programmatic approaches to digital humanities in the arts. During the last year as courses moved online and museum capacities were reduced, many digital projects were created, and this overview covers only a very small percentage of DH work in libraries. Employees and resources were reallocated from other departments to create metadata or transcriptions for digital collections remotely. Even with pandemic delays, it became apparent that a great deal could be accomplished under extraordinary circumstances with a relatively small shift in focus.  Another urgent shift, unrelated to the pandemic, is happening. The Maryland Institute Black Archives (MIBA) or Blackives project, by student Deyane Moses, provides some of the clearest evidence that despite the vast number of digital collections, digital humanities projects and digital archives created in art libraries and museums, there are many stories that have not been told.Footnote 26 MIBA documents the Black experience at the College from its beginning in 1892, to a 1935 exhibition on lynching, to 1954, when admission was opened up to students of color, through to the present day. In a 2016 conversation with the LA Review of Books, Jessica Marie Johnson reflected, “DH has offered people the means and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far as I'm concerned….If there isn't a place for this type of work within what we are talking about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty conversation.”Footnote 27 It is vital for art information professionals who create data from collections, develop state-of-the-art interoperability across systems and press forward with new digital tools, to take the time to look backward, to discover gaps in collections and to support colleagues and communities in efforts to rebuild their own histories through digital humanities.  The digital humanities have enabled art libraries to extend the reach of many traditional functions such as collection building and development, bibliographic instruction, providing access to unique materials and original cataloguing in support of art and architecture fields. Collections now house multimodal representations of architectural sites and digital assets in many dimensions. Instruction covers digital techniques such as photogrammetry and visual literacy not only for art and architecture, but across disciplines. Name authorities are being linked in a truly global database, Wikidata, and bibliographies such as the Digital Art History Directory help patrons sort through an abundance of digital art historical projects in a few clicks. The ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons will provide an opportunity to carry out the professional work of art libraries in a truly collaborative fashion. Upcoming projects from ARLIS/NA members include visualization services; digital privacy; crowdsourcing data; art faculty data and research impact assessment; digital accessibility; digital project preservation; digital publishing and open educational resources (OER); multimodal storytelling; virtual reality artist residencies; and oral histories, to name a few — as art librarians continue to increase engagement with their collections through the digital humanities. 1.

"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: What Does A Photograph Sound Like? Digital Image
          Sonification As Synesthetic AudioVisual Digital Humanities","Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual
          material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial
          produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new
          artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh
          ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object
          into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew,
          with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by
          cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the
          aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital
          transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and
          deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching,
          remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing
          at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes
          from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music
          revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image
          sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music
          being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the
          silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does
          help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy,
          and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as
          well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected
          perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a
          cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges,
          activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH
          activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.",http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000508/000508.html
"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: A Digital Humanities Approach to Narrative Voice in The Secret Scripture: Proposing a New Research
               Method","This paper is situated within debates surrounding modes of “close” and
                  “distant reading”
               [Moretti 2000] as they are played out in both the fields of world
               literature and digital literary studies. It proposes an alternative digital
               humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close
               comparative reading rather than the mode of “distant reading” endorsed by Franco
               Moretti and Alan Liu [Liu 2012]. Specifically, the research method
               proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The
                  Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative
               reference to Pat Barker’s well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a
               digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary
               analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be
                  “practicing partners” in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields
               of world literature and digital literary studies. I’ve only known one 100-year old, and she hardly spoke at
                  all. Most centurions, I’d wager, limit themselves to “pardon?” and “the nurses are stealing my clothes,” and few
                  if any are capable of eloquence like this: “There
                     was a black river that flowed through the town, and if it had no grace for the
                     mortal beings, it did for swans and many swans resorted there, and even rode
                     the river like some kind of plunging animals, in floods. (The Valve, 29 September 2008)”
                Rivers developed a therapeutic treatment based upon the
                  principle of catharsis whereby the patient was encouraged to eschew repressive
                  tendencies and give voice to the traumatic memories […] without dwelling
                  excessively upon them. Patient and physician would work together to construct from
                  these painful memories a narrative that found some tolerable, or redeeming, even
                  pleasant association for the trauma. [Hemmings 2005, 114]
                Much is made of
                  this idea in Ulysses: could possibly be an allusion
                  to it. But equally possibly not. Certainly this passage has modernist echoes — the
                  classical and the mundane.",http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/000178.html
"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the
                    Globalization Compendium","In the digital humanities we specialize in imagining and
                    launching digital projects, but we rarely consider how to
                    end them. In this paper we propose to discuss the ends of a
                    particular digital project as a case study for the planning
                    of ending. The project we focus on is the Globalization and
                    Autonomy Online Compendium that was developed as a digital
                    outcome of the Globalization and Autonomy project.
                    Specifically, this paper will:  Survey the general issues at stake when planning
                            for the end of a digital project; Provide some background on the project and the
                            Compendium;Discuss the underlying technologies that had to be
                            dealt with; Address the specific problem of ending and how we
                            prepared this project for archival deposit; And conclude by talking about some other ends
                            that are really beginnings.
 When can a digital scholarly project
                        be considered finally “done”? Perhaps never.
                        Something done is past, irrevocable, requiring nothing
                        more and indeed immune from further action.

                        those who responded to this consultation, the figure is
                        55 per cent. This extrapolates to approximately 1200

                        1998 and 2000, or an average of 400 each year. As of
                        January 2001, only 7 per cent of those researchers

                        one half were able to identify an actual data archiving

ANN: Exploring the Caribbean in DH: A dLOC as Data workshop series | H-LatAm | H-Net,"Much as archipelagos—a journal of Caribbean digital praxis pushes us to recognize, scholars of the Caribbean “are called upon now, with some urgency, to adapt our investigative and pedagogical methods to an academic climate deluged by a superabundance of information and analysis.” This ‘digital turn’ comes with much possibility, of course – just as the pages of archipelagos attest – but it can also be a daunting turn to navigate. In the hopes of encouraging more Caribbean-focused digital humanities scholarship and collaboration, the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) is pleased to present Exploring the Caribbean in DH: A dLOC as Data workshop series. This workshop series is for anyone interested in either Caribbean Studies or digital humanities. It will plot and explore the landscape of data sources in Caribbean Studies, and will provide space to think about and discuss how to identify and use various Caribbean data sources. Across the various workshops, participants will work with dLOC’s own collections – getting a sneak peak at the dLOC as Data project in the process – and other resources to develop new skills and explore new possibilities for digital inquiry. The series will explore various technical, conceptual, and ethical considerations for such work as well. All of the workshops will be held via Zoom. There is no cost to join, but advance registration is required. Please see below for individual workshop details – and note that there are more to come. For any questions, please contact mad320@miami.edu. This series is sponsored by the Collections as Data initiative, a Mellon Foundation-supported program.   Foundations: Delving into Newspaper DataJune 4, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit This workshop uses the DLOC Newspaper collection to explore the critical role of primary source data in archival research. The session will help participants think through the following questions: The workshop will employ theories of close and distant reading (broadly defined) to help participants explore select titles in the DLOC newspaper collection and will also analyze digital projects using DLOC newspaper resources as primary data to evaluate the collection’s strengths, gaps and possibilities for telling Caribbean stories. To register, please  here: REGISTER.   Student Workshop: Dreaming with DataJune 11, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit This workshop takes the rhetorical exercise of inquiry as a point of departure for navigating DLOC data. We will use rhetorical analysis as the framework for searching and analyzing items and collections in the database. Participants will employ a “search and serendipity” method as a point of entry into the portal and use the inquiry framework to define, refine and their research questions and project design. The goal of this approach is to interrogate and challenge the colonial concept of “discovery” in archival research, by positioning the student researcher as a practitioner of care for archival material of all kinds. This workshop is ideal for students with big ideas or broad topics of interest who are curious about working with digital data collections and want to use them to help clarify their thinking and refine their research questions and strategy. Participants do not need to have any experience with digital humanities or computational analysis, but should be prepared to come to the workshop with a broad research topic in mind. With specific attention to the digital collections of DLOC, participants will be guided to use primary sources as the catalyst to turn ideas into research questions, then into more formal projects. During the workshop, participants will be introduced to and work with digital concept mapping with Miro software to create a subject or keyword matrix. We will explore the interfaces of DLOC and Chronicling America, and use select data sets from these including Dominica Herald, Abeng (Jamaica) and Barbados Mercury to discuss connections and themes emerging from the matrix in order to refine research questions. The workshop will also introduce students to methods and tools for searching and analyzing bulk data, including MALLET and Voyant, used for topic modeling in digital humanities contexts. To register, please  here: REGISTER.   Ethical Re-use: Disaster Related DataJune 18, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit The Caribbean is a historically vulnerable region for many reasons, including its relationship to climate and the environment. The region’s experience with extreme disasters – from the magnitude 7earthquake in Haiti to Category 5 hurricanes barrelling through many countries’ and now the eruption of the volcano at St. Vincent’s La Soufriere – and with public health threats, including Chikungunya, Dengue fever, Zika and now COVID-19, is well documented. As a result of the frequency and intensity of these events, the region’s history of disasters is now a major focus of Caribbean Studies research. DLOC data becomes valuable for contextualizing our current moment through the lens of the Caribbean’s sociopolitical and environmental history. This workshop aims to reflect on the theories and praxis of research and data use, and to think through best practices for navigating data about disaster. The workshop will address some key topics including: To register, please  here: REGISTER.   More workshops to be announced soon! Copyright © 1993 - 2021.

Francesca D’Amico-Cuthbert | Toronto Hip-Hop & the Music Marketplace — Human Stories,"Dr. Francesca D'Amico-Cuthbert is the 2020-2021 Community-Engaged Early Career Postdoctoral Fellow at the Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto. A trained historian, Dr. D’Amico-Cuthbert’s research explores the history of American and Canadian Black popular music, the creative industries and the music marketplace with expertise in Rap music and Hip-Hop culture. Her PhD work traced how Black rappers in the era of mass incarceration constructed complex ethnographies of urban spaces, transformed dispositions of power, and unmasked the modes and mechanisms of a persistent and haunting coloniality in the afterlives of American slavery. Her current postdoctoral research explores Toronto Rap music’s relationship to commerce, anti-Black market segmentation and the availability of state revenue streams and marketplace exposure – and in doing so, highlight a social history of power relations between Toronto Hip Hop practitioners, creative marketplace elites, and state-actors. Currently, Dr. D’Amico-Cuthbert also serves on the Education Committee of the Universal Museum of Hip Hop – which is dedicated to the preservation of Hip Hop’s history and is set to open in 2024 in the Bronx, New York City.

English Market goes interactive | Cork Independent,"By Geraldine Fitzgerald Cork’s famed English Market attracts visitors from all over the globe, and a new website by a UCC student recalls its history in fascinating detail. Student Daniella Traynor created an interactive website to explore the socioeconomic history of the English Market as her final year project for UCC’s Digital Humanities and IT degree. She used maps, video, and data visualisations to outline the changes to the English Market over years of redevelopment, fire and a changing food landscape. Exploring SHUA (Socioeconomic History of Urban Areas) was developed by Daniella to use digital tools in an engaging way to examine the history of culturally rich urban areas. The English Market is an institution that “survived revolution and war, fire and famine, depression and boom, changing tastes and intensifying competition, as well as a rapidly changing socioeconomic, food and retail environment,” said Daniella. She added: “It’s the first place I take people when they come to visit me in Cork, so it’s ideal to showcase the method of using deep maps. I wanted to produce a digital artefact that goes beyond its academic application to tell the story online.” Archival video footage and various source materials act as a guide through the tumultuous history of the English Market from the early 20th century to modern day. The site shows the market’s place in Cork culture, while focusing on the detail of the history of individual traders, and the ebb and flow of the various stalls over time. “I learned not only about the tools and technologies involved in deep mapping, but the captivating story of the market we know and love today,” she added. Surprisingly, until Daniella’s project launched there was no publicly available map of the current internal layout of the Market nor any comparative maps of the changes through the years. She said: “Huge thanks to Cork City Council for being so helpful throughout the process and allowing me to bring the project to life. Also, I had the support of the incredible Digital Humanities department at UCC where I learned so much and was able to combine my passion for computing with my interest in society and history. I was so grateful for the opportunity.” “I hope to use my qualifications to pursue a career in humane technology to promote and preserve local and national communities, using a digital approach,” she concluded.

"Lecture by Smiljana Antonijević "" Scholars as Bricoleurs: The Plurality of Digital Humanities"". Recording and interview. | C2DH | Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History","While theoretical debates about the role of digital scholarship in the humanities abound, comprehensive empirical studies are relatively rare. In her talk, Smiljana Antonijević discussed findings of an ethnographic study of 250 scholars described in the presenter’s book “Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production."" She looked at how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies in their research workflows. In a bricolage manner, humanists construct their digital workflows from a diverse range of tools and methods suited to their preferences and needs, engaging with digital technologies in an unscripted and highly personal way that corresponds to their style of thinking and working, to their intimate epistemology. The “unruly” approach of bricolage may be outside the boundary of most DH theory yet, as Antonijević showed, it is important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and engage with this variety of voices and non-canonical technology uses, in order to pave the way for the pluralistic future of digital knowledge production in the humanities.    In this online video interview, Smiljana Antonijević discusses her background in Communication/New Media Studies and Anthropology and how she came to be interested in Digital Humanities. She then talks about her interest in the question of how scholars engage with digital technologies in their research workflows and the ethnographic work she did to uncover these. Finally, she also discusses how the insights gained could be translated into tool development and how her work related to where the digital humanities are currently headed. Dr. Smiljana Antonijević explores the intersection of communication, culture, and technology through research and teaching in the USA and Europe. She is the author of Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production (2015), while her other recent publications focus on ethnography of DH coding (2020), data ethnography (2019), Internet and trust (2019), humanists’ digital workflows (2018), and others. In addition to academic work, Smiljana is engaged in applied research in Silicon Valley, focusing on artificial intelligence, intelligent automation, and digital security.

 Title: Digital Humanities and African Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities, Embracing Challenges
 Abstract: The increasing interpenetration of computer science and technology with other disciplines outside the natural sciences has continued to accentuate the increasing importance of the digital transformation impacting our lives and society. Digital Humanities (DH), an emerging off shoot of this global digital revolution, espouses the deployment of new tools and techniques to retool humanistic scholarship and increase the use of social and cultural data for regional and global development. This presentation discusses how the academe and African scholars can explore new technologies to recalibrate their research endeavours and impact. Despite some perceived challenges, it is argued that these new approaches can reinvent, reconfigure and galvanize research and social transformation in Africa.

Sketchfab Community Blog -  » Digital Humanities at the Perm State University Museum,"Cultural heritage digitization at Perm University became possible due to the collaboration of the Center for Digital Humanities and the Perm University History Museum. The project team has an interdisciplinary background and is represented by historians, digital humanities specialists and museum workers who are open to active dialogue and using information technologies to enable wider involvement and recognition of cultural heritage in science, education, art and other fields. The project team is represented by experienced researchers – professor Sergey Kornienko, associate professor Nadezhda Povroznik, associate professor Maria Romashova, Perm University History Museum deputy director Elena Tararukhina, as well as a younger generation – graduate student Iliana Ismakaeva, and college student Arkady Zenkov. Nadezhda Povroznik (CV), an associate professor and employee of the Center for Digital Humanities, is the initiator of a program which is applying 3D-modeling and digitizing of museum exhibits based on photogrammetry technology at the History Museum. Being an historian with a Ph.D. in History, Nadezhda seeks to expand opportunities for studying the Museum’s collections, individual exhibits, their history, as well as the implementation of the 3D models for different purposes – in research, education, creative projects, etc. The Center for Digital Humanities was created in 2016 at Perm State University to conduct interdisciplinary research in the fields of digital humanities and historical information science, virtual museology, development of infrastructure of digital historical and cultural heritage, and the development and implementation of educational courses in undergraduate and graduate programs in the field of information technologies in the humanities. Elena Tararukhina (CV), Perm University History Museum deputy director, is a philologist with extensive experience in project management in the field of contemporary art. Finding herself at the museum with an antique collection was an unexpected challenge for her. But the experience of re-thinking ancient heritage using new technologies, as it turned out, offers great potential. The collection of Perm University History Museum is quite eclectic: in one exhibition space one can see photographs, documents, maps, various devices, stuffed birds, test tubes, and objects from the epoch of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome together. One of the most important collections of art is not fully publicly available. It appeared along with the opening of the university in 1916 for educational purposes and illustrates the diversity of everyday life and the culture of various civilizations. The collection consists of ancient Greek and Egyptian objects of bronze, glass, bone and ceramic, Western European engravings of the XVIII – XIX centuries, and exhibits of Russian and Eastern applied art.  A couple of years ago we started working on the website, a platform that unites the museums of Perm University. At the same time, the idea to create a virtual museum was put forward. We started by adding interactive historical maps of the university in the city and a virtual tour of the exhibition “I Know How to Control the Universe” and a panorama of the museum memorial wall. The next stage was an experiment with 3D-modeling and placement of annotated three-dimensional models of the most valuable exhibits in the virtual museum. Understanding the opportunities for presenting museum objects in three dimensions was the motivation for the first experiments. Thanks to the support of the Perm University Endowment Fund, the first digital collection of the Museum’s antique objects was made. It included ancient Greek vessels, figurines, and theatrical masks. Due to the lack of the required amount of space, part of the museum collection is not represented in the exhibition. For example, now only Greek and Roman objects are available for public access. Interchangeable exhibitions certainly solve this problem partly, but the interest of visitors is always broader than the exposition capabilities of a small museum. Thus, the gradual expansion of the virtual space allows us to expand the accessibility of our collections. Every year Perm University History Museum holds a “Museum Night” at Perm University, in which university museums and a botanical garden participate. In the laboratory format, the curators of the festival art program acquaint artists with museum collections and offer to reflect on them in the university space. The digitized collection is always a big bonus in terms of mobility and accessibility, which is very important for the inspiration of artists. 3D-modeling is also integrated into the educational process, which is appropriate, since the museum collection was collected primarily for educational purposes. The Center for Digital Humanities initiated and launched the Master’s program “Digital Socio-Cultural and Art Practices” within “Cultural Studies”, in which a portion of the courses is devoted to working with historical and cultural heritage, digitizing museum objects, developing virtual museum space and creating 3D models of museum objects. We emphasize that it is fundamentally important in the work of future specialists of museums and the GLAM-industry (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) as a whole to deal with real objects of cultural heritage. One of the positive effects is communication and experience exchange within the museum community, which is connected with the expansion of the possibilities of using 3D models in the museum’s inclusive programs and other projects. One of our recent models was the ritual object shabti. The ancient Egyptians imagined that, having died, a person must pass many trials, after which he or she, in the best case scenario, appeared at the Field of Reeds – an exact replica of the Nile Valley. There they had to work. In order not to work by themselves, the Egyptians made shabties (translated as “respondent” from ancient Egyptian) – figurines, usually made of faience, symbolizing helpers. Text written on shabti: “Enlightenment of the face. Osiris royal scribe Djedher, true of voice, born Wadjet, true of voice”. This shabti can be attributed to the late period (664-332 B.C.). The ancient Egyptian museum collection has many opportunities for research. 3D-modeling and placement on the Sketchfab platform invite further scientific interest (both Russian and foreign) in confirming precise definitions of text, dating, as well as building a network of objects from one archaeological site that went to different parts of the world. The process of creating 3D models can be divided into several stages:  For photography, a camera with interchangeable lenses is used. Small-sized exhibits are photographed using a Canon Macro Lens EF 100mm f / 2.8 Macro USM lens for a Canon EOS 600D camera. Large and immobile stationary objects are photographed using a conventional Canon EF-S 18-135mm f / 3.5-5.6 lens IS STM. Museum objects are processed on a rotating graduated platform in a 60 cm-high softbox. Illumination with an adjustable angle of inclination is set on three sides – on the top, left and right of the softbox. Top lighting is installed on a special bar. LED illuminators with a low level of heating are used as illuminants. The camera is fixed on a tripod to get better pictures and minimize distortion when shooting. We began experiments with photogrammetric technology using amateur equipment and a desire to get high-quality models. We noticed that, in general, medium-sized models were of an acceptable quality, while small exhibits had low quality due to shooting with a simple lens. Therefore, a special macro lens was acquired, which is currently used to shoot small exhibits for higher resolution and more detailed texture. There are always situations when something is missing due to lack of professional equipment or expert knowledge, but these problems can be addressed. Today, even having amateur equipment and limited experience and skills allows you to make high quality models. The main thing is the desire and understanding for why this is necessary, and working with a friendly team. We have a wonderful university collaboration between the Center for Digital Humanities and the Museum of History, and together we turned our first experiments with 3D-modelling into a promising and dynamic project that gradually has moved beyond the usual creation of a digital collection. As for the museum of history of Perm University, 3D-modeling now expands our capabilities as follows: We have already started new experiments, this time related to the 3D-printing of the ancient models (the 3D-model was modified and printed by Feodor Yurganov, a master student). The first trial object was the oenochoe, an antique vessel used in ancient Greek wine-drinking rituals. The vessel was created in the 7th century BC and is one of the most valuable and significant objects of the Museum. It is not surprising that the oenochoe became the first printed object, because there was an additional interest in creating a 3D model of this vessel. Let’s look at the three-petal neck structure. There was no obvious answer: was this form a purely aesthetic feature of the vessel or did it have some practical sense when a cupbearer could pour wine at the same time in three other vessels for further direct use by feast participants? The printed model helped to answer this question. It was impossible to pour into three vessels at the same time. Today 3D-modeling can be the starting point for creating interdisciplinary connections, and long-term cooperation, including in interactive and gaming environments. From an emotional point of view, this is a figure of Osiris, which is not in very good condition in reality, but at the same time it has a number of features that indicate the fine work of the master. The surviving feathers on the crown, enamel on the eyes and uraeus convey the features of a perfect image. But the main thing here is Osiris’s frozen smile, as if everything is in order, and he is in his place.   Digital Humanities at Perm State / Perm State University’s Museum / PSU Digital Humanities Facebook / PSU Museum Facebook   About the author  Perm State University Your email address will not be published.

The one-week summer school will involve 5 intensive training days where the learners have an opportunity to gain thorough understanding of the role of a Research Software Engineer in Digital Humanities research. This is an introductory course open to all (including postgraduate students, early career researchers, data scientists), and will require full time (8h/ day) or part time (4h/ day) remote attendance for a week in the UK timezone (BST) - see more below.  Morning lectures will introduce examples of research projects in Digital Humanities (DH) that have strongly benefitted from the contribution of Research Software Engineering (RSE) experts in the team. The afternoon sessions will consist of hands-on activities on the topics presented in the morning. Each day will finish with an open discussion with a speaker on their career in between RSE and Digital Humanities. Please note you can apply either for the lectures only (theory) OR for both lectures and practicals (full experience of the summer school). You will have an option in the application form to select which of these you are interested in.  Opening talks by Barbara McGillivray on the challenges and prospects of the intersection of Humanities and Data Science at the Alan Turing Institute and on REG role in Living with Machines by Ruth Ahnert and David Beavan, PI and Co-I on the project. Afternoon activity on integrating Git-flow when collaboratively developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool for Digital History in Python (by Federico Nanni, Kasra Hosseini and Mariona Coll Ardanuy). DH-RSE Stories by Giovanni Colavizza (previously at Turing Research Engineering Group and Living with Machines Co-I) on his career path back-and-forth between Digital Humanities and Software Engineering. Best practices in coding for humanities research to make code more open, reproducible and sustainable. Morning talks on recent DH projects in Cambridge where research software has been integral to research outputs. Coding activity in Python on organising and evolving code projects for usability, re-use and automation. DH-RSE Stories by Mary-Chester Kadwell on the 'coding journey' that individuals take as they go through their careers: developing individuals and code in tandem. Present your result efficiently: using code and interactive tools for data visualisation in humanities and social science. Best practices and pathways to generate more informative, reusable and open visualisations of your datasets. The day starts with a keynote on “Data Visualization: From Exploration to Storytelling to Participation” by Benjamin Bach. We then provide two activities in sequence: The first activity is a hands-on tutorial on network visualization using The Vistorian (vistorian.github.io). The 2nd activity is offered in R - participants are not required to have knowledge of it - it is part of the training activity to experience working on a project in a non-familiar programming language. The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by Lucy Havens., who will share her path from a degree in Information Systems to a job in business and technology consulting, and from there to research positions at the intersection of design, data science, and the humanities. A Sustainable Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model for RSE. The morning session will look at case studies and introduce the SDLC, with contributions from other members of the Lab. The afternoon will be delivered in medium length sessions which apply SDLC principles to hypothetical research project scenarios, working in groups to refine requirements and priorities, and to plan a digital strategy. Presented by Neil Jakeman and Ginestra Ferraro. Opening talks by Dave De Roure and Jane Winters on current and future landscape in UK and beyond for DH&RSE. Coding activity by Federico Nanni and Sarah Gibson on using MyBinder for research reproducibility in digital humanities contexts. DH-RSE Stories by Olivia Vane and summer school wrap-up by Federico Nanni. Deliver an overview of Research Software Engineering (RSE) tailored to the specificities of Humanities research Illustrate the importance of best RSE practices to build reliable, efficient and reproducible code in Digital Humanities (DH) Showcase the fruitful integration of RSE within important UK DH research projects Discuss the career path that DH-RSE people have taken Highlight how the summer school could become the first step towards a more structured training scheme Learning outcomes Structured overview of RSE best practices and their integration in DH Clearer understanding of their personal RSE skill-set Familiarity with the broad role / competencies of a RSE in a research project Consider RSE as a career path  The course is open to anyone but especially to Digital Humanities scholars with a few years of experience in using a programming language (preferably Python). The attendees additionally need to be familiar with the academic debate around the benefits and issues of the use of computational methods and infrastructure in Humanities research projects, as this topic will often emerge in talks / discussions. If the participants have research experience with some of the topics taught at the Oxford Digital Humanities Summer School they possess the knowledge to participate in this Summer School. Otherwise good starting points are: Our Summer School positions itself ideally between the preparation offered by 3) and 4). It is meant to prepare people that have worked in DH for a few years to allow them to move into RSE. Therefore, while 4) covers the most important RSE topics, we are not expecting participants to be familiar with all of them. However accessing these materials would allow them to better assess their current knowledge of the field. Additionally, it will allow the attendees to familiarise themselves with the RSE culture / topics. Regarding the debate around the pros and cons of adopting computational methods in humanities research, good overviews are offered in:",https://www.eventsforce.net/training/dh-rse

EADH 2022 Call for Hosts | EADH - The European Association for Digital Humanities,"The EADH Executive Committee invites proposals for Local Organisers (LO) to host the 2022 EADH Conference. The EADH Conference is organised each year that the annual ADHO Digital Humanities conference takes place outside of Europe, and has the objective to strengthen the scientific, institutional and cultural relations between the members of the DH communities in Europe and the Mediterranean area. EADH is particularly interested in proposals from institutions and regions that: Please note that the lead applicant must be a direct member of the EADH or of one of its Associate Organisations (currently AIUCD [Italy], DHD [Germany], DHN [Nordic Countries], CzADH [Czechia], and DH Russia). EADH Conferences are co-organised by two committees: The scientific organisation is conducted by a Programme Committee (PC) between 8 and 14 members and one Chair, appointed by the EADH Executive Committee. The local organiser may appoint up to two members of the PC. The PC decides the main theme of the conference, identifies and invites keynote speakers, produces and issues the Call for Papers, manages the review process, and decides the academic conference programme. The logistical organization will be the responsibility of a Local Organisation Committee, whose members and chair are appointed by the Local Organisers. Conference dates are decided by the Local Organiser, in consultation with EADH Executive committee. It is recommended that the conference takes place in the autumn of 2022. Other large DH-related conferences in Europe should be taken into account when fixing the precise dates. The venue must be an academic or cultural institution in the European and Mediterranean area in its broadest sense. The hosting institution should be able to accommodate a minimum of 300 delegates (including plenaries), at least three parallel sessions, and a communicative poster session. The Local Organizers must also have the infrastructure and organizational staff to guarantee online access to delegates and speakers. The availability of accommodations at accessible prices is an element that will be considered in the evaluation of the bid. Bids should contain a preliminary budget and up to two pages describing the motivations and logistical opportunities offered by the proposed venue. Bidders must take into account the EADH diversity and inclusivity statement and the ADHO code of conduct. The venue for the 2022 conference will be decided by the EADH Executive Committee on the basis of: Bids should be submitted to secretary@eadh.org and CC to fabio.ciotti@uniroma2.it no later than June 30, 2021. The Conference should be a 2/3-day event, avoiding weekends. Workshops and training events can precede the official conference days, depending on the availability of the LO. Presentations will be organized in 90-minute slots. The conference should have two keynote plenary talks. Typical presentations are: Bidders in coordination with the Programme Committee are encouraged to propose alternative formats and innovative organization of the conference in addition to this general framework. The conference must be financially self-sustaining or create a small surplus. Surpluses and deficits for conference finances are distributed at a ratio to EADH and to the local organizer according to this formula: 60% ADHO / 40% LOs. In case of loss, EADH backstop funding will not exceed €5,000. The EADH will also provide bursaries for young scholars. At least 50% of EADH’s share of surpluses will be earmarked specifically for future conference travel bursaries and other pro-inclusion actions. The local organizers are expected to set six levels of registration fees: Local Organisers are expected to set member/non-member rates so that the difference between member/non-member rates are higher than the EADH membership costs. Registration fees are recommended not to exceed €300 for the highest level of non-member fees to make the conference more accessible to the community. Local Organisers are expected to arrange a diverse social programme, including a social dinner, that can contribute to the EADH community building. Usually, this social programme will highlight the local culture of the conference venue. Suggested collaborative activities range from hosting workshops and tutorials to co-organisation of the conference or financial support. Private in-kind and financial sponsorship is welcome, provided that any activity from sponsoring organizations is clearly distinct from, and does not influence, the academic program.

ELTE.DH joins DARIAH as Cooperating Partner | DARIAH,"The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-EU) is proud to announce it has signed a Cooperating Partnership agreement with the Centre for Digital Humanities (ELTE.DH) at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest, Hungary.  “I’m very excited about our Cooperating Partnership with ELTE,” said Edward J. Gray, the Officer for National Coordination at DARIAH. “This is an important first step toward establishing a closer collaboration with our Hungarian colleagues, and in the future, welcoming Hungary as a full member into the DARIAH family.” ELTE.DH was created by the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) to keep up with the global trends and to create a stable centre for the education and research of digital humanities in 2017. As a research- and practice-oriented scholarly institution, ELTE.DH ensures focus and coherence for all efforts that have been made in the field of digital humanities at the faculty and examines digital research aspects not yet considered.  “It was among the most important tasks of Hungary’s oldest institute of higher education, the Eötvös Loránd University, to adopt the latest scientific and technical advancements in the field of humanities,” said Dr. Gábor Palkó, Head of Department for Digital Humanities at ELTE.  ELTE.DH will contribute to DARIAH by granting access to some of its impressive training and pedagogical materials via DARIAH-CAMPUS, as well as participating in working groups and promoting the exchanges between researchers in Central Europe. The educational and research activities of ELTE.DH are summarized in the ELTE.DH Yearbook. Since 2019, ELTE has introduced over 500 undergraduate students per year to digital humanities coursework, in addition to 150 PhD students who receive specialized attention. As of 2020, ELTE now boasts the first university department dedicated to Digital Humanities in Hungary. For more information on ELTE’s DH courses, check out the DARIAH-CLARIN Digital Humanities Course Registry.  One of ELTE.DH’s key objectives is to help increase the visibility of Hungarian, and in a broader sense, Central European DH research through organising international workshops and conferences. Two major international events took place at ELTE, with a large number of European and non-European participants in 2018 (DH_Budapest_2018) and 2019 (DH_Budapest_2019). The International Journal of Digital Humanities was initiated by researchers at ELTE.DH and its third thematic issue will be published soon. Supported by the Institutional Excellence Program for the Higher Education, ELTE.DH’s researchers focus on the peculiarities and differences of the analogue and digital approaches of textual analysis, ranging from the questions of semantic repository representation and automatic data enrichment of digital heritage, to the handling of biographical and bibliographic data, the use of stylometric and author identification algorithms, and the development of various natural language processing tools. As participants in the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History”, ELTE.DH’s researchers have worked on establishing literary corpora to promote the practice of computer-aided “distant reading”. ELTE.DH is also leading the National Laboratory for Digital Humanities, established on the initiative of the Hungarian Ministry of Innovation and Technology, which aims to develop, in an inter-institutional collaboration, a methodology for the AI-based processing, research and education of national cultural heritage and its widest possible dissemination. The Laboratory focuses on the development of language-processing algorithms based on  machine intelligence, the development of an annotated Gold standard corpus as well as web-archiving of Hungarian language materials.

"TLDR: My Two Year Journey With ""My Struggle."" — Arthur Kibert Basler","Your Custom Text Here I brought Book 1 on Thanksgiving vacation to Tampa two years ago. It was one of those rare days when I got to read all day. I barely moved from bed. My in-laws played with our newborn daughter, Arwen, just a couple months old. At the time, I didn’t know anything about Knausgaard, the controversial release of My Struggle in Europe, I just knew that the voice in Book 1, the narrator was attempting something genuine, something fierce.  I read Book 1 and 2 in rapid fashion, just a couple months—I couldn’t stop. Arwen was an infant then, barely able to roll over, bottles and diapers and a wonderful smile.  She’s two now and has endless energy, sings all day, and pets puppies with frenzied joy. I finished Book 6 last week, and mostly, I feel a little empty, feel like I’ve said goodbye to an old friend. I’ve been tempted to go back and read Books 1 and 2 again. It’s been so long that I can’t recall them in detail.  I drive 70 miles from Atlanta to north Georgia where I teach each day. It makes for great book time. Listening to Books 3-6  was a joy, a companion in my ear for so many hours over the last year. Edoardo Ballerini does an amazing job narrating.  My Struggle—all six volumes—is worth the time. I wouldn’t skip any of them, not a page. I wrote about Joyce’s Ulysses back in the summer, and I considered why it’s a difficult read. That book, at the sentence level, with its alien interior, and mashed up narratives is just, flat-out, a work-out to read. This is not the case with Knausgaard’s novels. Instead, sheer mass is in play here. My office mate, Justin, just read Book 1: he loved it, thought it brilliant, but he’s hesitant to dive into the whole series. He had to “resist” jumping right into Book 2. I know what he means. There is something electric, haunting, and frenetic in the first couple of books.  Sometimes this day-to-day focus makes for some slower passages—I wonder how many cigraettes and cups of coffee are consumed in the course of My Struggle? But this focus on the daily circuit—one that we each run—also lends to the force of his novels. Sections would seem like they were drifting, or without real direction and then hundreds of pages would come to a head in one shattering moment. Much of Knausgaard’s childhood memories seem banal, every day, without significance, but then you see how much his father really hurt him, how much his father warped him. And ultimately, what are we but our day-to-day? We are those moment to moment people who become our habits.  I try to explain to people, how these six volumes feel to read. One thing: I think I know more about Knausgaard than many of my own family members. I mentioned this to Justin and he mentioned that our outer lives are often sanitized, cleaned-up for social media presentation. I agree, and here, I think Knausgaard excels. Of course, he’s not shown us EVERYTHING, but he has shown us much of his core, his fears, his shame, his unending self-censorship in day-to day life. I have spent 3600 pages or 100 plus hours listening to this man talk about himself, his world, his desires: Knausgaard as boy, as teen, as twenty, as a father, as a 40 year old looking back. My Struggle ends, really, in the middle of life, not a true ending at all. The struggle isn’t over.  Book 6 features a 400 page essay about Hitler growing up in pre-WWII Europe and it’s the only part of Book 6 that made any sense to me, was organized and concise. Book 6 is long, at well over a thousand pages. It’s the only volume that I thought needed serious editing or trimming. But, but, but the essay on Hitler is brilliant. If you only read that, it’s worth picking up 6. Knausgaard attempts the impossible: to humanize Adolf Hitler, to portray the man as a person who should be “hated for what he did, not who he was.” Knausgaard implies several parallels between himself and young Hitler: both were struggling artists, both hated bourgeois culture, both had strained relationships with their fathers, both went from small towns to city life. But, these are where the similarities end. Knausgaard cites a slow, meticulous, biography on Hitler. It’s a brilliant piece of writing in the middle of Book 6. How did a struggling artist, a WWI vet, and nobody rise to ultimate power? and in that role as German leader, orchestrate the Holocaust?  How do we still view this person as a human and not just a monster? How do you humanize Hitler? How do we live in the shadow of the early 20th century? For Knausgaard, this moment in history is a critical moment, a moment where society shifted towards the modern, the fragmented; it was the world he grew up in in 1970’s Norway. A Norway only 30 years removed from WWII, still embedded with abandoned Nazi coastal bunkers.  Ultimately, the struggle, for Knausgaard, is one with his father, the ghost, the ever present authoritarian spirit. Knausgaard makes some interesting points about fathers and sons in Ulysses, Hamlet, and the New Testament. All feature sons and fathers at odds, or in utterly different roles. Knausgaard was physically abused by his father, but the daily emotional abuse is what left a decades long shadow over him. He can never truly overcome the legacy of his father, the alcoholism, the terrible death, but the novels are a form of catharsis at least, a way for Knausgaard to push back against his father’s control. What is a life worth living? For Knausgaard, it’s writing, it’s about being present, it’s being close to his family, even when they are driving him mad, it’s saying to the world: I’m going to tell this story, even if I must pay dearly for it. At the core of this novel is a question: What is authentic? Can any fiction be worthwhile? I’ve thought about this for the last couple years as I seek my own writing identity. What is worth writing about really asks, what is worth living with, thinking about, for we are what we write. The stories we retell become new and alive to us. For Knausgaard, at least with My Struggle, he could no longer write fiction; he had to deal with his own narrative. This shift closer to non-fiction, this fusion of autobiography and novel is wonderful to read and cost Knausgaard much, perhaps, as he concludes Book 6, too much.

Digital Humanities Research Hub Seminar | School of Advanced Study,"6 May 2021 | Locating a National Collection through Audience ResearchGethin Rees and Valeria Vitale (British Library) Locating a National Collection (LaNC) aims to help cultural heritage organisations to use location data—such as where objects were made and used or the places they depict and describe—to connect collections and engage audiences. Location-based interfaces such as web maps offer opportunities to open up collections to new audiences and uses. This presentation explores how LaNC is using audience research methods including surveys and focus groups to inform geospatial data structures and interface design.Catch up on the session now. 20 May 2021 | Editorial Transformations and Minimal Computing at the Melville Electronic LibraryChristopher Ohge (SAS) The Melville Electronic Library was established in 2009 after receiving a digital humanities start-up grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and then received additional NEH scholarly editions grants until 2017. But when the project had exhausted its grant funding, it still had much editorial work to do, so the editorial team worked with its technical partners to transform the entire project into a static site using minimal computing principles. This seminar will outline the transformations undertaken by the project, and how the minimal approach revealed the affordances of sustainable computing for humanities projects.Catch up on the session now. 3 June: 2021 | Teaching Digital Approaches to Cultural Heritage as an International CollaborationGabriel Bodard (SAS) For the past several years I have been teaching two modules on digital approaches to the ancient world for SAS students and the London intercollegiate classics MA programme. One of these modules focuses on text and language (“Classics” proper) and the other on Cultural Heritage, a mix of imaging, geographical information, and other approaches to the study of historical material culture. This second module, which is titled “Digital Approaches to Cultural Heritage,” uses the collaborative and international Sunoikisis Digital Classics programme, which enables us to bring a range of perspectives and expertise into both the design and the delivery of content. This presentation will discuss the mix of technical, practical, and theoretical approaches that students engage with in this programme, and the invaluable contributions from scholars and practitioners in archaeology, heritage institutions, art law and other fields, that have brought to the syllabus topics around intellectual property, ethics, questions of representation, cultural norms and sensitivities, and debates around restitution and repatriation of heritage in the digital realm.Catch up on the session now. 17 June 2021 | “Stop, collaborate and listen”: Lessons on interdisciplinary collaboration from the Living with Machines ProjectRuth Ahnert (QMUL) The Living with Machines project, based at The Alan Turing Institute, brings together historians, data scientists, curators and library professionals, computational linguists, and digital humanists, to examine the human impact of the coming of the machine age (c.1780-1920). This paper will discuss what it is like collaborating on such an unusually large and interdisciplinary project. It will discuss in particular the challenges of creating a shared vision and programme of research that respects the different research and work cultures of its members, and their expectations about how to work, what constitutes a meaningful outcome, and how that should be disseminated.Catch up on the session now. 1 July 2021 | Researching Social Media in the Digital HumanitiesNaomi Wells (SAS), Rhiannon Lewis (SAS) & Nayana Dhavan (KCL). Social media research is often associated with (new) media and communications studies, which have to a large extent laid the theoretical and methodological foundations for such research. Recent years have, however, seen an increasing interest from those working within DH, as reflected in conferences and publications in the field. This is connected to the growth of the field of internet history and the consolidation of born-digital archives in the museums and heritage sector. It is also a result of the increasing need for those who study contemporary cultural practices and texts in the humanities to address the undeniable role of social media in contemporary life. While there have been attempts to explore the intersections between media studies and digital humanities (see e.g. Sayers 2020), critical questions remain about what digital humanists bring to the study of social media and how social media research connects with more established approaches within DH. Including short presentations on current social media research in DH, this seminar will invite discussion on these ongoing questions concerning the role of social media research in the field.Catch up on the session now. © School of Advanced Study 2020

"Fundraiser for David Noonan by Jessica Noonan : OK, Copernicus Productions needs your support!","Your donation matters http://7h34c4d3my0f473x4ndr14.org
 I am Jess Noonan, founder and executive director of OK, Copernicus Productions & Management, Inc. This business is my only job, my husband and I pour every ounce of energy we have into building a business that someone with my disabilities would not only create and organize, but build it’s inclusive and charitable structure than the ground up. Both my husbands VA and disability has been cut to below $18,000 a year while I’m trying to generate income while changing my community for the better. Please help us, we have sacrificed everything for a system that has never had our back in return. We can to change the world away from the painful suffering distracted by more discomfort believing we deserve this because of fate or power or money. Not my company, not my business, we want those who invest in positivity for all sentient life and we need you help. Our company is so small we are all volunteers hoping for a better life, one we’re creating, please help us build it.We are located downtown, very close to Hood College, where I once studied and ran the philosophy club, along with a few other colleges we could interview interns from to help grow our brand new nonprofit organization and social club dedicated to the enrichment and preservation of the arts and humanities though technology. Digital humanities advancements that have made sharing this type of hands on studio education much more accessible, especially with safety concerns due to COVID-19, to offer apprenticeship through the in-house/remote hybrid structure of our organization’s platforms (zoom, google, YouTube, Anchor.fm, Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, Twitch.tv, Pinterest, Wordpress, Medium, TikTok, Snapchat, MS Teams and growing to advance cyber art, music, and humanities educational and entertainment pursuits) as a teaching tool open to everyone we can possibly work with and embark knowledge in many cases alongside our permanent staff and peers in the social club who attend for their art affinities and a sense of community. We need promotional/art supplies (we do our own art and printing in house, but need supplies to produce merchandise for fundraising and showing support), we need to cover our server and subscription fees for the first year. Material upgrades to the studio equipment, especially hardware and software that is very itemized, we will choose to host fundraising for video/music/production equipment as a separate fundraiser to be pitched to and approved by Kickstarter’s policies. Stay tuned once research and development is given the green light we will embark on that next crucial project to take us hopefully to vocaloid and holographic tech with more education and technology becoming more affordable with modern advances.We want to compensate the two interns we select with a nice stipend and an amazing experience in multimedia content creation, networking, participation in peer based outreach programs, trying out and gaining proficiency in multiple multimedia skills, soft skills and a new view of cyber etiquette and ethics are strongly upheld in the workplace for professionalism, art/tech/music/philosophy lectures and tutoring are available to give and receive experience in, book drives, newsletter creation, plus many other perks of joining Team Copernicus for our big debut in the streaming/social networking edutainment demographics…Hopefully many more innovations will come from our studio offering hands on opportunities for local humanist students trying to find their preferred medium to express their voice in the 21st century!Learning is supposed to be a beautiful, adventurous journey of wonderment, growth, and appreciation. Help us use tech for good, bringing back culture and discourse and self improvement during these inherently trying times. Help us bring hope and perhaps innovative new solutions in education and community outreach. Thank you!https://youtu.be/YelZy7LPWuE

IDRH Welcomes the 2020 Digital Humanities Fellows | Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities,"LAWRENCE — The Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Kansas has announced the newly selected fellows for the 2020-2021 program focusing on the ethics, politics and techniques of digital storytelling. From a competitive pool of applicants of KU faculty, staff and graduate students, the 10 fellows were selected to join IDRH in a yearlong, institutionwide conversation about issues in the digital humanities. Each fellow will participate in working groups twice a semester (virtual or in-person), attend presentations by the IDRH colloquium speakers and commit to workshopping digital humanities projects, which they will present at a final Digital Humanities Fellows Symposium. The fellows will be paid a $,1000 stipend. L. Marie Avila, undergraduate engagement librarian for KU Libraries, will use digital storytelling in support of Indigenous ways of knowing. She wants to share the compelling theme of self-determination and sovereignty within Indigenous librarianship. Avila will apply Indigenous research methods in order to meet the needs of this project and ethically center Indigenous librarians and information specialists from historically underrepresented groups. This research project aims to provide a decolonized version of librarianship using digital storytelling techniques that she will learn during this fellowship. Avila plans to make a map-based visualization that demonstrates the outreach and intersections of transferable knowledge among Tribal College and University (TCUs) librarians by utilizing the landscape to capture the localities of TCUs, ALA-accredited library and information science graduate programs, and state flagship universities. Avila's motivations for this project include the scholarship on the Classification Bias in the organization of American Indian materials in libraries, data about librarians’ demographics, and the retention and graduation rates of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in higher education. Ignacio Carvajal, assistant professor in the Department of Spanish & Portuguese, looks forward to exploring the relationship between digital pedagogy and digital humanities and building on his work designing online educational materials in K’iche’ — a Mayan language spoken in the highlands of Guatemala. As a long-term goal, he hopes to create a digital repository of materials not only for K’iche’ language learning but also for the exploration of literature, art and thought arising from Iximulew and the rest of Central America. Carvajal plans to create a first batch of K’iche’ language materials anchored around the story of Manuela Petronila Tahay Tzaj, K’iche’ teacher and assistant instructor in K’iche’ lessons at KU. The lessons will center Tzaj's experience as an educator and provide a reflection on contemporary K’iche’ language and culture in Nahualá and Iximulew at large. Bobby Cervantes is a doctoral candidate in the Department of American Studies at the University of Kansas. His research asks how the working poor’s struggles, ideologies, and cultures expose the pervasive influence of class exploitation on the nation’s development into an industrial and global capitalist hegemon. He is at work on his dissertation, “Las Colonias: The Housing of Poverty in Modern America,” which historicizes the more than 2,000 rural, unincorporated communities (las colonias) on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border where poor families have lived for more than a half-century. Using property records, media accounts, oral histories and government archives, his dissertation argues that the colonia project has formed a new transnational territory of poverty. A Texas native and journalist, Cervantes has published his work in the Houston Chronicle, Texas Monthly and Aztlán: A Journal of Chicano Studies. Germaine Halegoua, associate professor in the Department of Film & Media Studies, is in the process of researching and writing a manuscript about dark fiber networks in the U.S. that intervenes in pressing debates about digital divides, corporate models of internet architecture and ownership, and offers new insight into the ideologies and social decisions that structure internet connectivity. Dark fiber networks are fiber-optic networks purposefully constructed as inactive and are practically invisible to urban and rural populations—not only are they dormant and hidden under layers of concrete or dirt, but their exact locations are also obfuscated. Her research consists of two parts that rely on collecting and analyzing digital stories: tracking the network itself and locating traces of the social decisions and policies surrounding network installation, use and non-use. In addition to a conventional manuscript, she plans to create an interactive map embedded with interview segments, infrastructure design blueprints and annotated photographs of dark fiber routes and access points to accompany the book. Ayesha Hardison is an associate professor in the departments of English and Women, Gender & Sexuality Studies. Her current book project, ""Specters of Black Freedom Struggles,"" explores the ways late 20th- and early 21st-century African American writers and artists wrestle with the legacy of black freedom struggles in their representations of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. Examining portrayals of these campaigns in fiction, film and material culture, Hardison plots a cultural history of this era by analyzing writers’ and artists’ engagement with historical memory. In turn, her project considers how contemporary cultural narratives shape our historical memory of the period. Narratives about this era continue to evolve as the nation commemorates the anniversaries of notable moments in black freedom struggles. Moreover, recent events, including Black Lives Matter protests, renew this history’s significance by exposing its present-day resonances. Hardison aims to deepen our appreciation of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements by unpacking the conceits embedded in depictions of this history as well as analyze the various narrative techniques used to codify it. She intends to convey the importance of these historical representations with the methods and tools the digital humanities offer for twenty-first-century storytelling. Shane Lynch is a doctoral student in American studies. His work, tentatively titled ""Gila River Generations,"" is a pixel graphic video game that incorporates the traditional stories of the O’odham and Pee Posh peoples of central Arizona. The game will include both culture’s creation stories and languages. The game will be done both in 2D - ¾ overhead view and in scrolling screens (up and side scrolling). Lynch will combine elements of puzzles, RPGs, platformers, hack and slash elements along with cut scenes to the combined stories. The game will have text that will be written in O’odham, Pee Posh and English with plans to expand the language aspect of the game. The game is currently in development with plans to use Unity to produce the game. The goal is to create a learning experience while engaging in traditional storytelling through video games. ""Gila River Generations"" is a continuation of culture through digital pixel graphics. Joey Orr is the Andrew W. Mellon Curator for Research at the Spencer Museum of Art. Each academic year, the Integrated Arts Research Initiative (IARI) at the Spencer Museum of Art organizes an inquiry that is broadly conceived to encompass a large spectrum of practitioners across the sciences and humanities. The 2020-2021 inquiry, “Tending to the Body,” looks at humanities and artistic-based contributions to our understanding of the human body. Because of COVID-19, this year’s inquiry will take a digital form to support interdisciplinary discussions when more traditional ways of gathering pose public health risks. This new digital storytelling format will need to weave together contributions from each member of the inquiry’s cohort. These contributions will take forms as varied as text, audio, and still and moving images. It must also explore and be sensitive to all of the many urgent contemporary issues that intersect with ideas about the body, including race and health equity. With a digital storytelling tool developed for each year’s inquiry, future contributors will be exposed to each other’s work and explore connections in advance of gatherings, lending a new level of depth and consideration to our exchanges. Hyunjin Seo is an associate professor in the William Allen White School of Journalism & Mass Communications. She will examine how to incorporate digital storytelling into her project on online privacy and security for women recently released from jails and prisons. She will adopt a co-design approach working closely with women in reentry currently residing in Kansas and Missouri throughout the process and centering their interests and needs in building related content. Women in reentry will learn and use digital storytelling techniques to tell their own accounts of challenges and opportunities related to online privacy and security. These will then be used to help other women in reentry and soon-to-be-released women learn about issues related to online privacy and security. Properly addressing ethical issues is critical to developing and implementing this project. Therefore, ethics of digital storytelling will be at the core of her fellowship project. Systematic research based on direct interactions with this population is essential to developing a program tailored for these women’s particular needs and interests. The proposed project will help them navigate digital spaces in a more secure manner. Erin Wolfe is a metadata librarian at KU Libraries. The goal of Wolfe's project is to provide a case study on a community’s response to a global situation by analyzing local newspapers’ coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a variety of natural language processing approaches on two Douglas County newspapers, this project will look at the ways in which trends and patterns develop and shift over time through the topics and language used in articles published to the web and what this might tell us. One aim is to be able to contrast these results with similar projects being conducted on a national scale to highlight differences and overlap in themes and coverage between these scopes. A more challenging aspect of this project would be to identify and explore which topics and perspectives are represented and which are lacking from these local published accounts, which may help to bring attention to underrepresented voices in our community. James Yeku is an assistant professor in the Department of African & African-American Studies. Digital Nollywood uses Omeka to collect and exhibit movie posters from what is now considered old Nollywood in Nigeria. In terms of output, Nollywood is the second-largest film industry in the world. Old Nollywood posters, mostly from 1992 to the early 2000s, provide important historical perspectives on the evolution of film in Nigeria. As the most popular film industry in Africa and the African Diaspora, Nollywood serves as a platform for telling the African story, highlighting how the film medium can embody the values, meanings and identities of groups and communities. The stakes of Digital Nollywood consist in the reconstruction of the history of Nollywood through a significant aspect of its production that is rarely discussed in the scholarly community on African cultural productions. A digital archive of film posters on Nollywood enables the preservation and historical documentation of Nollywood’s paratexts, which can be beneficial for scholars and students of film history Nigeria.

Visualization and Interpretation | The MIT Press,"MIT Press Direct is a distinctive collection of influential MIT Press books curated for scholars and libraries worldwide. More Info >   MIT Press began publishing journals in 1970 with the first volumes of Linguistic Inquiry and the Journal of Interdisciplinary History. Today we publish over 30 titles in the arts and humanities, social sciences, and science and technology. MIT Press Journals By Johanna Drucker “Graphs, charts and maps are often considered to be objective expressions of facts. But the fact is that they are complex texts, demanding interpretation. That is why this is an important book, building a solid bridge between the evolving field of data visualization and the long humanistic tradition of critical interpretation.” Martin Engebretsen Professor in the Department of Nordic and Media Studies at the University of Agder; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society Mouseover for Online Attention Data An analysis of visual epistemology in the digital humanities, with attention to the need for interpretive digital tools within humanities contexts. In the several decades since humanists have taken up computational tools, they have borrowed many techniques from other fields, including visualization methods to create charts, graphs, diagrams, maps, and other graphic displays of information. But are these visualizations actually adequate for the interpretive approach that distinguishes much of the work in the humanities? Information visualization, as practiced today, lacks the interpretive frameworks required for humanities-oriented methodologies. In this book, Johanna Drucker continues her interrogation of visual epistemology in the digital humanities, reorienting the creation of digital tools within humanities contexts.  Drucker examines various theoretical understandings of visual images and their relation to knowledge and how the specifics of the graphical are to be engaged directly as a primary means of knowledge production for digital humanities. She draws on ideas from aesthetics, critical theory, and formal study of graphical systems, addressing them within the specific framework of computational and digital activity as they apply to digital humanities. Finally, she presents a series of standard problems in visualization for the humanities (including time/temporality, space/spatial relations, and data analysis), posing the investigation in terms of innovative graphical systems informed by probabilistic critical hermeneutics. She concludes with a brief sketch of discovery tools as an additional interface into which modeling can be worked.  “Graphs, charts and maps are often considered to be objective expressions of facts. But the fact is that they are complex texts, demanding interpretation. That is why this is an important book, building a solid bridge between the evolving field of data visualization and the long humanistic tradition of critical interpretation.” Martin Engebretsen Professor in the Department of Nordic and Media Studies at the University of Agder; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society “How can the humanities benefit from information visualization and how can visualization be more suited to the purposes of the humanities? Johanna Drucker expertly confronts these questions in her excellent new book Visualization and Interpretation. Ultimately, this timely and welcome book is about making visualization more human.” Helen Kennedy Professor of Digital Society at the University of Sheffield; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society “Drucker's new book is a very important and truly original contribution to digital humanities, data visualization, and data science fields. She develops a new paradigm for thinking about relations between cultural artifacts, knowledge, interpretation, data and visualization. The ideas presented in this book will change how we think about culture, data and display and the book itself will remain the key reference in decades to come.” Lev Manovich Presidential Professor, The Graduate Center, City University of New York; author of The Language of New Media and Cultural Analytics  Anne Burdick,  Johanna Drucker,  Peter Lunenfeld,  Todd Presner,   and Schnapp Jeffrey

‘the creatures He made’: Animal Welfare in Salvation Army History | The Salvation Army,"‘the creatures He made’: Animal Welfare in Salvation Army History References to the importance attached to animal welfare in the early history of The Salvation Army regularly crop up on this blog. Treating animals with kindness and humanity is often presented as an important aspect of a Christian life. Our Director Steven has written about how members of the Band of Love, the Salvation Army-run children’s temperance organisation, promised to ‘try to love all and be kind to Animals’. There were economic considerations to Salvationists’ attitudes to animals and animal products as well, however. Our Archives Assistant Chloe quotes an officer’s advice on caring for working horses in the waste paper works of the Men’s Social Work, which is strongly linked to the fact that horses were a valuable resource. In both Chloe’s post on Katie Booth’s old coat and my own on vegetarianism, there is a sense that the use of animal products, including fur and meat, was discouraged for Salvationists because these products were expensive, and saving on them left more funds to donate back to The Army. Nevertheless, Salvation Army institutions such as Hadleigh Farm did produce animal products for the market. The early Salvation Army’s attitude to animals seems to be closely related to Genesis 1:28, in which humans were given stewardship over other animals – but any use made of animals should be respectful and free from abuse or mistreatment. The wellbeing of animals and people was clearly seen as interconnected. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century people and working animals relied on each other, and the best results would be achieved if both could have a long and healthy working life. This idea informs initiatives such as the so-called Cab Horse Charter that General William Booth invoked in his 1890 blueprint of The Salvation Army’s social work, In Darkest England and the Way Out. The welfare of London cab horses had become a popular cause following the publication of Black Beauty, Anna Sewell’s 1877 novel exploring the lives of working horses. Booth referred to the benchmark for care given to cab horses – ‘When he is down he is helped up, and while he lives he has food, shelter and work’ – to argue that people should be entitled to the same. While The Salvation Army remained focused on people, animal welfare is a recurring theme in The Darkest England Gazette, the weekly magazine dedicated to the Social Work between 1893 and 1894. In the early issues references to animal welfare and animal suffering frequently appear in the short fragments of news and remarks that filled up leftover column space. These might, for instance, pick up on reports in other publications of blood sports or mistreatment of working animals and present these as examples of condemnable cruelty. In later issues reports also start to appear on the importance of animals in The Salvation Army’s agrarian ventures. One key contemporary animal rights cause that found its way into The Darkest England Gazette is the high-profile issue of vivisection. Surgical experimentation on living animals was widespread in medical research and training during the period, and activists from many different backgrounds campaigned for it to be banned. The Booth family were opposed to vivisection and corresponded with anti-vivisection campaigners. Between 7 April and 9 June 1894, The Darkest England Gazette included a series of contributions from Edith Carrington (1853–1929), a prominent anti-vivisectionist who seems to have had no other connection with The Salvation Army. Her contributions are clearly geared towards The Salvation Army’s Christian ethics, however, and Christian responsibility is central to her arguments. According to Carrington, caring for animals is a Christian duty signifying mercy and humility. Her contributions follow three key tenets: the un-Christian attitude of vivisectors, practising Christians’ resilience in the face of suffering and death, and the dangers of breaking down moral barriers to cruelty. Evoking Genesis, she argues: [Animals] were delivered into our hands for food, clothing, and help; but never in order that their beautiful forms, the work of God’s fingers, within and without, should be mangled, burnt, scalded, bruised, torn to pieces, to satisfy the curiosity of a barbarous surgeon as to how the marvellous thing was made. In other words, all animals are God’s creation, which humans are not entitled to violate. It follows that those who practise or defend vivisection act in an un-Christian way. Carrington states: The vivisector’s religion may rightly be described as Materialism, or a kind of worship of the body, because he seeks to obtain for himself or others a long life, and freedom from pain, no matter at what risk to the soul. […] Now, those who have a spiritual religion know that pain is not altogether a real evil, to be shirked at any price. […] If we seek to get rid of pain, or even death, by means of a sinful action, we murder the soul, and lay up eternal misery for that! Elsewhere, she also argues that Christians derive from their faith the strength to endure suffering, so that they ‘have no need to seek to shuffle pain off upon beings less able to bear it than themselves’. Rather than ultimately improving people’s lives, then, this kind of experimentation in fact causes both individuals and society to deteriorate morally by devaluing the very concept of care. Carrington asks: ‘Can young men, who begin life by trampling on every merciful instinct, be fit for the profession of healers in after years?’ As these doctors’ moral instincts were worn away, she suggests, they would become less respectful of other life, and even become tempted to treat human bodies as further experimental material, rather than seeking to heal them. In an article entitled ‘Human Vivisection’ she states: ‘From the helpless dog to the defenceless baby is one step, the next leads to the almost equally feeble invalid mother…’ This argument asks for animals to be taken into account in The Salvation Army’s understanding that no human life is worth less than any other. If it is clearly no more acceptable to experiment on an infant than on its exhausted mother, Carrington asks, why should it be permissible to practise the same cruelty on a dog or any other species? In the early Salvation Army, caring for animal welfare was considered part and parcel of a Christian’s duties. Although the use of animal labour and products was not prohibited, it was felt to be important for a number of reasons to make use of animals in ethical ways. Failure to do so was associated not only with social and economic irresponsibility – as by hurting valuable working horses, for instance – but also, as Carrington shows, posed a direct danger to one’s own spiritual welfare. By hurting animals, people were likely to end up hurting themselves as well as others in the long run.

Sage Advice on Digital Humanities – JESociety,"The Jonathan Edwards Society Here’s some great advice regarding Digital Humanities from a 2017 interview with Ken Minkema: Continue to acquaint yourselves with the latest advances and applications in digital humanities. I was a member of that transitional generation that, in less than two decades, went from paper and pen to manual typewriter to electric typewriter to computer, so understanding the digital world did not come naturally. But now it is not only vital for superior teaching and personal research, but provides the basis for being flexible and adaptable. With this foundation, one can teach in various settings whether onsite or online, or work in public history capacities, in libraries and museums, in historical editions, in advocacy, in philanthropy, and so forth. I would add to this — be “flexible and adaptable” and able to create code that solves problems and eases entry for readers into large and complex corpora like The Works of Jonathan Edwards and Early Church Fathers. The video below demonstrates the Quickview feature of Visual Edwards software and how one can start exploring a single passage of WJE and extend it to the larger corpus (and even compare with Augustine and the other Fathers).

Can Digital Humanities Be Informed by Bioinformatics? Visualising Passim Data for Multiple-Book Relationships | The Aga Khan University News,"​ As KITAB’s research has shown, passim is an incredibly powerful tool for answering a variety of questions about book history and history in general. The algorithm produces a huge amount of data, which we can utilise in our research in many ways. At present, we typically investigate text reuse in the corpus at the level of relationships between pairs of books. That is, we look at statistics that tell us what percentage of one book is reused in another and we visualise alignments between two books. This approach is great for understanding how two books are related, but once we start comparing multiple books these approaches become quite cumbersome. To note a couple of examples: what if we wanted to investigate how one particular book was disseminated across tens or even hundreds of later works? Or, what if we wanted to know about how one particular unit of information (perhaps a narrative about a major event) circulated throughout our corpus? To help deal with these kinds of questions the team has been developing new applications for understanding multiple-book relationships. In this blog, I will take the opportunity to introduce some of the applications under development. To do so, however, this requires a short tangent on bioinformatics. The computational analysis of text reuse has developed and advanced alongside that of genomics. This is a fact noted explicitly by David Smith, when he acknowledges that passim utilises the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm, which is also used in the analysis of genes.[1] Text reuse and genetics are both concerned with problems in sequencing. Put simply, when biologists wish to analyse genes, they convert genetic material into a sequence of letters (A, C, G, T), each of which represent a chemical nucleotide base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine). Three-letter words termed ‘codons’ specify the amino acids that are used by the body to build proteins.[2] There are also ‘stop codons’ that mark the end of the sequence. Similarities in sequences of letters between parts of a chromosome or with other chromosomes, or even similarities between the genomes of different animals, might indicate (for example) similar biological functionality. In short, important biological questions can be resolved by identifying similar sequences of letters and alignment algorithms like Smith-Waterman are used to undertake this task.​ Read more​ Mathew Barber​​ Research Associate for KITAB at AKU-ISMC. Mathew Barber's research is concerned with the practice of history writing and remembering in the Medieval Islamicate world. He is interested in particular in history writing under the Fatimids in Egypt, the preservation and dispersal of Fatimid-era historical texts, and what this preservation (or lack thereof) means for how later historians viewed and understood the Egyptian past. He is concerned with answering such research questions using a combination of digital and traditional methods, in particular using computational text reuse detection to identify so-called 'lost' texts.​​​​​ ​ As KITAB’s research has shown, passim is an incredibly powerful tool for answering a variety of questions about book history and history in general.

Moving On (again) | cradledincaricature,"In September 2001 I arrived at the University of Southampton to study a degree in History. In September 2021 I’ll be returning to Southampton to take up the post of Director of Digital Humanities. This means leaving where I am. I’ve had such a wonderful time at the University of Sussex and the Sussex Humanities Lab. I’ve worked with some inspiring colleagues and students, collaborated on some fab projects, and made some good friends. Sussex has also indulged my uneasy relationship with Digital Humanities. Because whilst I’ve published in DHy places, run DHy things, gone to DH conferences, written DHy work, and read DHy books, I have rarely described the Sussex Humanities Lab as a place that does (only) Digital Humanities. Yes, we’ve built a community of expertise around technology’s role in shaping culture, society and the environment. And yes, we use technological tools to undertake research within the arts, humanities and social sciences. But our work ranges from AI to climate justice, ecoacoustics to automated writing, intersectional feminism to research infrastructures, critical heritage to robot opera. And whilst, when it is tactically useful to do so, we’ve described all that as ‘Digital Humanities’, more often than not we’ve described it in disciplinary terms, as interventions in practices and traditions that we’ve sought to understand, to integrate into, and to bridge between. Indeed, when Sharon Webb (my fabby amazing co-conspirator at Sussex who I’ll miss a lot!) and I won an award for working DHy things into our undergraduate History curriculum, we did so not because we taught our students DH, but because we empowered (I hope!) our students to consider how digital transformations have changed the conditions in which they do history and the approaches they can take to studying the past. They had after all, as I had 20 years earlier, come to uni to study History. Over recent days I’ve been picking through Adam Crymble’s Technology and the Historian: Transformations and the Digital Age. Adam is another person I’m proud to consider a co-conspirator, and I’ve had the pleasure of glimpsing at this book during its gestation. I believe we really need his historicisation of recent historical practice. And I’m pleased I’m not alone in welcoming his key argument: that we need stop worrying about what ‘digital history’ is, and focus instead on the actual work historians are and have been doing. And so when my eyes landed on Adam’s introduction to his Glossary, where he notes that it’s presence is intended to encourage ‘practitioners to use more precise language when discussing “digital” or “digital history” work’, I kinda whooped, both with my History hat on, and because I have similar feelings about the use of the term ‘Digital Humanities’. Technology and the Historian resonates then with my longstanding discomfort with DH as a label for the work I get involved in, because I don’t think of it as DH, I think of it as history that leans on methods from computational lingustics, or digital forensics as archival practice and advocacy, or critical making that happens to involve building a website, digitising some stuff, and figuring out a bunch of metadata harmonisation, or highly collaborative action research that draws on digital preservation in seeking to create positive change in people’s lives. Despite this longstanding discomfort with DH, I’m soon to become a Director of Digital Humanities (the third time I’ve had ‘digital’ in my job title, for anyone who is counting). I am genuinely excited by this, partly because in my interview I don’t feel I held back on that discomfort (and they still wanted me!), and partly because Southampton has some great infrastructure, people (some of whom taught me!), research software expertise,  and ambitions. But I’m also excited because where once questions like ‘what is Digital Humanities’ made me squirm and bumble or – on a bad day – sigh or go defensive, I feel that I’ve now reached a place where I’m comfortable in my uncomfortable DH skin, where I can turn around a question on the definition of DH to ask people why they are interested in knowing what DH is as a route to figuring out what DHy things can do for them and their work. I wouldn’t have got to this place of comfortable discomfort without my (nearly) 6 years at Sussex, without colleagues like Tim (especially, Tim), Sharon (ditto), Amelia (ditto), Caroline, Jane, Alice, Nicola, Claire, Jo, Rachel, Andrew, Lucy, Mariz, Joanne, Vinita, Flora, Jo, Alex, JoAnn, Freja, Suzanne, Natasha, Laura, David, Ben, Louise, Jake, Tom, Beatrice, Amy, Chris, Alex, Liam, Ilona, Jim, Clive, Kate, Anna-Maria, Ahmed, and many, many, many more.

Old Books and New Technologies: Medieval Books and the Digital Humanities in the Low Countries • KBR,"Discover what being a woman actually meant in our regions at the end of the 15th century. From the Virgin Mary to mermaids. Clemens Neudecker discusses the achievements and experiences of the QURATOR project at the Berlin State Library for document layout analysis. Discover the sound of Toots Thielemans at this experiential exhibition in which sound and music play the leading role. On 6 and 7 May 2021, KBR, in partnership with the Campus Condorcet of Paris, the National Library of Luxembourg, the KB national library of the Netherlands, the universities of Ghent, Leuven, Liège, Mons and Namur, and the Vlaamse Erfgoedbibliotheken, will be holding an international conference on medieval books and the digital humanities in the Low Countries. It will bring together representatives from libraries, museums, archives with researchers interested in the ‘medieval book  and new technologies’. Particular emphasis will be placed on the methodological dimension of the use of digital humanities. Working languages will be English, Dutch, and French.   Over the course of the Middle Ages, what was called the Low Countries developed an original written culture. It is known to us through sources in Latin, in Middle Dutch and in Old and Middle French. At first centred in the Benedictine and Cistercian abbeys of Egmond and Friesland in the North or the Dunes, Ghent and the closely connected chain of Lobbes – Gembloux – Liège in the South, it increasingly became a town phenomenon following the development of the largest and most dense urban conglomeration in the European Middle Ages both with large towns like Ghent, Bruges, Tournai, Liège, Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, Utrecht and a series of smaller cities scattered over the area, all with their convents, and, consequently, books. In the 15th century, the production of luxury manuscripts for the Burgundian court and its environment flourished in Bruges, Ghent, Oudenaarde, Brussels and Tournai, which gave rise to the development of an important pictorial culture. At the same time, the presence of towns, cathedrals and chapters all over the area gave rise to the rise of the famous French-Flemish school of polyphony, the works of which often have come down to us in beautifully executed manuscripts. The urban character of the region in the later Middle Ages was essential in the development and expansion of such phenomena as the Devotio moderna or early Humanism. When the latter was essential in the spread of Latin schools and the amount of 15th-century editions of classical Latin authors in the IJssel region, the first found its expression in a proper network of convents and libraries, which is highlighted by the ‘Red Cloister Register’, the famous collective catalogue compiled in the early sixteenth century. All this produced an important heritage of medieval books, manuscripts and incunabula as well as the sources for their history up to the eighteenth century (old library inventories, pre-modern bio-bibliographical sources, accounts of literary journeys, etc.).   The essential part of what has been preserved of this important heritage has fortunately survived in the libraries and manuscript collections of our regions. Over the last few years, important survey and recovery projects have been started in what has become the Benelux: CICweb.be for the French-speaking institutions of Wallonia and Brussels, Medieval Manuscripts in Dutch Collections for the Kingdom of The Netherlands and Medieval Manuscripts in Flemish Collections for Flanders. However, not all the heritage collections have been identified or explored, especially in the private and ecclesiastical libraries. Moreover, not all the pre-modern sources useful for the study of this written heritage have yet been identified, surveyed or edited. To facilitate these scholarly activities, we must call on information technologies and particularly on digital humanities for inventory, research, preservation and enhancement of this heritage. Relevant technologies include Initiatives, such as the Sanderus electronicus, the electronic edition of the Bibliotheca Belgica Manuscripta project, have already been underway for years. However, all these initiatives have not yet necessarily been surveyed, and they are still not all accessible from a central point of information. Moreover, many manuscripts and the relevant sources that document their history are still poorly known to scholars working in this field. It therefore seems timely and opportune to make an assessment of the initiatives and to establish a research community around the written heritage of the historical Low Countries and the application of digital humanities to this field. An ‘observatory of written heritage’, comparable to Biblissima and in close collaboration with this pioneering French portal in the field, would be a good approach to creating a synergy between keepers of the historical collections, expert librarians, academic teachers and written heritage conservators.   Registration is now closed.

“6da0056908e47c275a3058bab145e5ad” in “Preface” on Liverpool University Press Digital Collaboration Hub,"Preface Keith Michael Baker I offer this preface in all modesty. I’ve compiled no databases, created no programmes. At best, I’ve benefited as an early adopter of some of the more manageable (but no less powerful) tools developed in the digital humanities. At worst, I’m a Zelig of the digital humanities world who has happened to show up in some of the right places, and at some of the right times, to observe its progress. From either of these perspectives I invite Enlightenment scholars and other readers to marvel at the ambition, creativity, ingenuity, persistence and sheer joy of discovery apparent in the pages that follow. They show scholarship in perpetual motion. They open avenues and suggest opportunities for humanistic enquiry that can pique our curiosity, empower our research, enrich our understanding and amplify our knowledge in remarkable and often unexpected ways. When I started my doctoral work decades ago, the Journal of the history of ideas had been publishing a succession of notes on early occurrences of the term ‘social science’. Successive scholars coming across the term – in Mill, in Comte, in Saint-Simon – each wondered whether they had stumbled upon the earliest usage. Since the concept of social science in the Enlightenment was my chosen dissertation topic, I thought I could begin with a more systematic investigation of the history of the term. I had an intuition that it could be found in Sieyès’s Qu’est-ce que le tiers état?, but turning the pages of a copy of that tract published in 1789 did not disclose it. The road instead led me to Condorcet, who had named the subject in the plans for public instruction he proposed during the French Revolution, from him to its inclusion in the organization of the Institut de France, and thence to the ideologues appointed to positions in that institution. From their writings, the term passed into English, on one side of the Atlantic via a Spanish translator of Bentham’s works, and on the other side via Thomas Jefferson’s translation of a text by Destutt de Tracy. I thought I had a pretty definitive essay on the subject to offer the Journal of the history of ideas, but that journal haughtily decided that it had no interest in considering further articles on the topic. I published the paper elsewhere only to learn later that I had been right about Sieyès: he had used the term in the first edition of Qu’est-ce que le tiers état? but had removed it from the many others published later the same year, only one of which I had searched. I mention this by way of saying that, having always been fascinated by the history of words, I was immediately excited when Robert Morrissey, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, floated the idea that a digital database being used to create a new French dictionary, the Trésor de la langue française, might also be utilized for other research purposes. I was an enthusiastic participant in the complicated and sometimes amusing negotiations that led eventually to the creation of ARTFL (American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language) and became one of its earliest users. I still have remnants of the reams of printout generated by then-clumsy searches in the database for early co-occurrences of ‘opinion’ with ‘publique’, and by efforts to gauge the frequency and correlates of basic Enlightenment terms like ‘société’, ‘social’ and ‘révolution’. How far ARTFL has come from those early days! Over the years, Morrissey and his brilliant team of collaborators have turned it into an immense resource for studying the Enlightenment while developing a powerful research engine (now PhiloLogic4) that is also available to scholars exploring texts in other fields and languages. One key step in the development of ARTFL was the digitization of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and D’Alembert, that massive keystone of the Enlightenment. This was a major accomplishment but it also opened an immense challenge. Generations of scholars had surfed the work’s seventeen folio volumes of text and its eleven volumes of plates. Its very bulk had made it a work more cited than read. What questions could now be addressed to this digital version? What could it be good for? This was the spirit in which Dan Edelstein and I first offered a graduate seminar on the digitized text at Stanford in 2006. It was immediately obvious that digitization would make it possible to address more systematically some longstanding questions about the work, its contributors, its organization, the classification of its articles and its treatment of various topics. But that seminar fired a desire to dive more deeply below the surface of the text, to ask about its sources and citations (or lack of them), to detect sunken materials and preserved traditions, on the one hand, and the often silent harvesting of modern thought on the other. Collaboration with the ARTFL team on the development of methods to answer such questions led eventually to the path-breaking sequence alignment analysis by Dan Edelstein, Robert Morrissey and Glenn Roe that revealed the extensive but largely unacknowledged borrowing of the encyclopedists from the work of Montesquieu, Voltaire and countless others. (A similar analysis of the ECCO database, reported below by Clovis Gladstone and Charles Cooney, has also made clear the massive resonance of the Bible in eighteenth-century English texts.) More discoveries of this kind will doubtless follow as scholarly interest and the stock of comparable machine-readable texts expand. As Robert Morrissey and Glenn Roe make clear in their essay in this volume, the digitized Encyclopédie is destined to become a critical ‘living’ edition of that work of which earlier scholars could only have dreamed. In the meantime, ARTFL now offers scholars the opportunity to use its search engine to open up the history of another great collective enterprise of the French Enlightenment through its recent digitization of all three editions of the abbé Raynal’s Histoire des deux Indes. If the Encyclopédie, why not the entire Enlightenment? Or which Enlightenment? Will a comprehensive topical analysis of eighteenth-century works one day allow us to discern more precisely an identifiable Enlightenment discourse emerging within it? Will it instead reveal a cacophony of Enlightenments? Clio is greedy, she always wants more. From Oxford she has received massive tribute in the form of Electronic Enlightenment, the pioneering achievement of Nicholas Cronk and Robert McNamee for the Voltaire Foundation, which is gathering into a single database the growing number of digitizations of the correspondence of individual Enlightenment authors. Cronk describes the process and editorial promise of this development below. Dan Edelstein, in turn, captures the excitement unleashed by the generous sharing of metadata from Electronic Enlightenment that made possible the creation of the Mapping the Republic of Letters project by Edelstein, Paula Findlen, Caroline Winterer and Giovanna Ceserani. Their engagement produced some unexpected results – notable, for example, in the visualization of Voltaire’s correspondence and of the nesting of an Enlightenment network within the Old Regime establishment. It also stimulated the serious and sophisticated reflection on visual design as an element of humanistic enquiry that has given birth to Palladio, the remarkable new tool for that purpose described below by Nicole Coleman. Major digital humanities engagements beyond the Chicago–Stanford axis are also brought to more general view in this volume. From MIT, Jeffrey Ravel presents a striking account of the development of the ambitious Comédie-Française Registers Project. He makes clear the imperative towards institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration inherent in digital humanities research while hinting at the tensions, vicissitudes and anxieties inherent in this endeavour and pointing out the questions about audience it raises. From Western Sydney University, Simon Burrows provides an update on the major resource he and his team have built over decades for research into the history of the eighteenth-century French publishing trade (FBTEE). This now includes the invaluable bibliography of eighteenth-century French novels described by Angus Martin and Richard Frautschi in their contribution to this volume. Gargantuan in its ambitions, FBTEE expands the range and enhances the power of Burrows’ database of French books sold by the Société typographique de Neuchâtel, the bookseller Robert Darnton made familiar to Enlightenment scholars as the purveyor of the forbidden bestsellers of enlightened Europe. His analysis sharpened by ongoing engagement with Darnton’s conclusions, Burrows invites researchers to confront the complexities of eighteenth-century publishing and the challenges of representation and interpretation they present. Navigating such complexities is far from easy. There is nothing mechanical about this work. It requires intellectual sophistication, historical intelligence, subtle judgement and endless decisions. Essays in this volume on research engagements related to FBTEE – by Alicia Montoya on analyzing catalogues of private libraries, by Katherine McDonough on confronting problems of identifying and locating early-modern places, and by Laure Philip on disentangling and representing available information regarding clandestine publications – each offer granular accounts of the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges of deriving and analyzing digital data. They are echoed in this respect by the contributions of Elizabeth Bond and Robert Bond on their topic modelling of French provincial newspapers and by Melanie Conroy and Chloe Summers Edmondson on their enquiry into the participants in Paris salons. As the editors acknowledge in their introduction, the publication of this volume opens an opportunity to weigh the achievements and promise of digital humanities against the cautions, criticisms and dismissals often levelled at it. Some of the latter are political: behind the digital humanities they see efforts of neoliberal academic administrators and their funding allies to destroy the traditional university or undermine the critical practices of the humanities within it. These charges appear to make digital humanities the stalking horse for an indictment of more general perceived tendencies within the contemporary university rather than engaging directly with it. However, the assumption that close reading of texts can be critical and disruptive while their distant reading is necessarily reactionary seems unexamined. The computer might as readily be used to disclose linguistic regimes of oppression as to sustain or advance them. More frontal dismissals of digital humanities research contrast ravenous costs in money and labour with a paucity of results. ‘Garbage in, garbage out!’ may be one of the most common tropes of disparagement, but there is ample evidence in the following essays to belie the image of philistine feeding of lumpen, ill-considered data into mindless machines. As for the common critique that digital humanities expends vast resources to unveil what we already know or mere common sense would have expected, there is much in this volume to rebut it. The comparatively circumscribed circulation of Voltaire’s correspondence is an obvious example of an unexpected result. The plagiarism of Montesquieu in the Encyclopédie might have been intuited, but its full extent would have been almost impossible to demonstrate without the technology of sequence alignment. The resonance of the Bible in eighteenth-century English texts might well have been expected by some scholars without our ever knowing how great it is. Or not. It is worth remarking that we think we know many things without knowing how well we know them, or without acknowledging that the things we think we know or expect may not turn out to be true, and are often in any case incompatible one with another. Eventually, I imagine, the term ‘digital humanities’ will become redundant, and computer-assisted humanistic research will cease to exist as a specialized field. Its methods will be absorbed by humanistic scholars more generally, serving and stimulating them in a variety of ways and to varying degrees according to their interests and the questions they pose. As that happens, this volume will be acknowledged as marking an important step in that direction.",https://liverpooluniversitypress.manifoldapp.org/read/6da0056908e47c275a3058bab145e5ad/section/a4d2adbf-6a51-4ca9-acd8-3f6a3a7524d8

Call for papers | DHASA 2021,"Call for papers DHASA Conference 2021Notice the extended submission deadline (29 August 2021) Theme: “Digitally Human, Artificially Intelligent” The Digital Humanities Association of Southern Africa (DHASA) is organizing its third conference with the theme “Digitally Human, Artificially Intelligent”. The field of Digital Humanities is currently still rather underdeveloped in Southern Africa. Hence, this conference has several aims. First, to bring together researchers who are interested in showcasing their research from the broad field of Digital Humanities. By doing so, this conference provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of Digital Humanities especially in the Southern Africa region. This includes Digital Humanities research by people from Southern Africa or research related to the geographical area of Southern Africa. Second, the conference allows for information sharing among researchers interested in Digital Humanities as well as network building. By bringing together researchers working on Digital Humanities from Southern Africa or on Southern Africa, we hope to boost collaboration and research in this field. Third, affiliated workshops and tutorials provide information for researchers to learn about novel technologies and tools. These related events are aimed at researchers interested in the field of Digital Humanities, to focus on specific aspects of Digital Humanities or to provide practical information for researchers to move into the field or advance their knowledge in the field. The DHASA conference is an interdisciplinary platform for researchers working on all areas of Digital Humanities (including, but not limited to language, literature, visual art, performance and theatre studies, media studies, music, history, sciology, psychology, language technologies, library studies, philosophy, methodologies, software and computation, etc.). It aims to create the conditions for the emergence of a scientific Digital Humanities community of practice.

Digital Humanities is thriving, and the essential role that libraries, archives and museums play in digital humanities initiatives is increasingly being recognised. Digital Humanities: An introduction for librarians provides practical advice for embedding digital humanities activities into daily operations of cultural heritage institutions, and inspiration for library and cultural heritage professionals wanting to actively engage with the digital humanities community. Which approaches have led to successful partnerships and collaboration with digital humanities researchers, and how to provide best access to digital collections, are among the questions readers can find answers to in this book. Content covered includes: • insights from humanities researchers working with digital methods across a range of disciplines including tips and tricks for successful collaborations with libraries and other cultural heritage institutions  • the opportunities and challenges of providing access to digital cultural heritage collections including case studies from key initiatives such as the 'Collections as Data' and 'GLAM Labs' movements • key tools and methods used by the digital humanities community including text and data mining, social network analysis and spatial humanities  • a range of organisational considerations for library managers wishing to strategically embed digital humanities support into the daily work of the library • how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can help libraries stay ahead of the game.  Featuring contributions from some of the leading researchers and practitioners in the field, this book provides an accessible, introductory guide to digital humanities specifically designed with librarians and cultural heritage professionals in mind.

 Computing touches every aspect of teaching and learning at MIT, and the humanities are no exception, with scholars across disciplines using computational tools to answer critical questions in humanistic research. MIT is uniquely positioned to innovate in the digital humanities, with widespread skills in coding and deep engagement in the humanities. Bridging the gap — creating a “bilingual” community, as MIT President L. Rafael Reif calls it — to make connections across diverse research interests will be one key to success. Now, a new collaboration between the MIT Programs in Digital Humanities (DH Lab) and the MIT Libraries is helping foster relationships among scholars with intersecting interests in computational culture. Since September 2020, the DH Lab has partnered with the libraries to present Digital Teaching and Research Collaborative Sessions, a weekly series of virtual events that provide a regular, informal space for faculty and researchers to connect with DH Lab staff, MIT librarians, and with one another. Recordings of these sessions are now available on the MIT Libraries’ YouTube channel. “We wanted to hold open space for instructors and researchers across SHASS [School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences] to meet and share their insights and experiences in online learning during this unprecedented year,” says Stephanie Frampton, associate professor of literature and faculty director of the DH Lab, founded in 2018 to build community through undergraduate research opportunities (UROPs), faculty research, visiting scholars programs, and events. “It began with a week of workshops on tools for online teaching just before the fall semester and grew into a year-long series of more than 30 events involving faculty, researchers, students, and librarians from all corners of the Institute and beyond. It’s been wonderful to see Thursday afternoons become a real touchstone for the community.” Frampton and DH Lab Research Associate Erica Zimmer, who was instrumental in organizing and running the events, were eager to partner with the MIT Libraries’ Ece Turnator, humanities and digital scholarship librarian, and Mark Szarko, librarian for comparative media studies, literature, philosophy, and theater arts. With the pandemic prompting a switch to remote learning, both librarians had been working extensively with faculty looking to enhance teaching and UROPs with digital tools. “Ece and Mark had already been working to bring the digital humanities forward at MIT, making people aware of tools, techniques, and case studies through IAP [Independent Activities Period] sessions, workshops, and a resource guide,” says Zimmer. “People at MIT know the libraries can help them figure out where they need to go next with a project, so their partnership has been crucial in that regard.” “It makes sense for the libraries to be a partner in creating community around the digital humanities,” says Szarko. “MIT faculty have a wide range of research interests, and the MIT Libraries provide a sort of neutral ground for making connections across disciplines. It’s a place that welcomes everyone.” The series started informally, with “water cooler” sessions on topics such as student engagement and strategies for teaching online. Other sessions demonstrated particular resources such as annotation, mapping, and text analysis tools, the collaborative publishing platform PubPub, or Relata, an experimental search tool for humanistic scholarship. Presentations also showcased underutilized collections at MIT, such as Archnet, a digital library developed by the Aga Khan Documentation Center. Perhaps most crucially, the series introduced participants to other scholars with similar research interests. “I enjoyed brainstorming with fascinating new — and old — colleagues that I would not have had a chance to speak with otherwise,” says Michel DeGraff, professor of linguistics and director of the MIT-Haiti Initiative, who attended multiple events. With an average of 25 to 30 participants at each session, the virtual events drew not only MIT scholars from various humanities fields, but also attendees from chemistry, electrical engineering and computer science, mathematics, and MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as journalists, filmmakers, and others beyond the Institute. People have tuned into the sessions, which are open to those with no prior experience using digital techniques in research or pedagogy, from at least nine different countries. With a return to on-campus teaching and research activity projected for the fall term, session organizers are discussing ways to carry forward the strengths of the series as well as the insights and sense of community cultivated during this unusual academic year. Whatever format these discussions take in the future, their goal remains the same. “We’re trying to create an ecosystem of knowledge and connections,” says Turnator. “The sessions are an opportunity to not only learn more about specific tools and resources but to see who else at MIT — and beyond — is interested in similar types of problems.” The MIT Programs in Digital Humanities are generously funded, in part, by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Data Feminism,"The MIT Press 2020 A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.",https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/
Digital Humanities Minor | Department of English,"Jump to content
  Open to students in all majors, the DH Minor focuses on the fusion of technology and the humanities. In recent years everything about the printed word has changed. What we read, where we write, and how we interact with books, stories, words, and images have profoundly altered our relationship with the cultural arts. The minor in DH explores what happens when the humanities meets the digital age.        The minor in DH creates opportunities to tell stories and make interpretive arguments by creating digital projects, such as:           *archives              *timelines           *movies                *maps           *games                 *new dynamic editions of cultural texts           *podcasts             *data visualizations Minoring is easy. You’ll need to take ENG 250 (offered in fall and winter terms) and ENG 470 (offered in spring terms) and an additional four elective courses approved for the minor. See below for a growing list of university courses approved for the DH minor. A schedule of current English department courses that count toward the DH minor can be found by following this link. To qualify for the DH minor, students must pass 6 courses: TWO required courses:   FOUR additional courses (2 of which must be at upper division level).  To insure interdisciplinary, these four courses must come from at least two different departments. Please see the UO course catalog for term listings of course offerings. Notations in parentheses, such as A&L, IPT, indicate courses that also satisfy CORE requirements.               All course work must be passed with the grade of mid-C or better. (Grades of C- or lower, and courses graded P will not count for the minor.).                                                                                                                                                     In this course you’ll learn how to use digital tools to read and analyze literary and cultural texts. For example, you may learn how to set up and keep your own blog; how to create maps of a literary work or a social problem; how to use topic modeling to study networks in a collection of many texts; how to find and curate data; or how to annotate or publish your own digital edition of a novel or poem. The course emphasizes both an introduction to a set of digital tools used in the field of DH, and on finding ways to apply those tools to the study of literary and cultural texts. Technologies and Texts Capstone is a course designed to address the digital turn in public contemporary culture, academic culture, and the humanities. This turn has profound implications for the way we interact with and understand the role of the humanities in the public sphere and the transmission of the written word into digital forms. At the center of this course is the creation of an original term-length digital research project (must be approved in advance by the Professor). Projects can be created by individuals or can be part of a collaboration with a faculty member or fellow classmates. Possible term-length projects include: Projects will be accompanied by a final explanatory essay. Together, project and essay will demonstrate proficiency with both the digital tools used to build the project and the subjects the project addresses.     For questions about Spring 2022 courses, please contact your teacher.

Digital Humanities & Critical Infrastructure Studies Workshop Series – Critical Infrastructure Studies.org,"Critical Infrastructure Studies.org Thinking about the built, repaired, and lived things of the world—how we make them, and how they make us. This series of meetings aims to enliven discussion about infrastructure from the perspective of Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, as a contribution to the emerging field of Critical Infrastructure Studies. The growing body of literature on the concept of infrastructure — in science and technology studies, media studies, cultural studies, and DH — prompts questions about why infrastructure is essential for studying people’s practices, what kinds of subjects are embedded in infrastructural systems, and, in particular, how the world can be transformed through infrastructural interventions. A focus on infrastructure reveals the materiality of practices, as a set of conditions that are laid down by various actors: academic institutions, cultural units, technology companies, publishing houses, and governmental bodies. Surfacing the relationships between these heterogeneous entities can give us an insight into the manufacture of substrates that are not fixed, but relational objects. Infrastructure is an articulation of materiality that is constantly in formation across space and time, as Nikhil Anand et al. argued in The Promise of Infrastructure (2018). A thing is therefore in the process of becoming infrastructure and composed of socio-technical assemblages that emerge from tensions between institutional actors, policies, and knowledge practices. These tensions — expressed as a clash between functionality and sustainability, standardisation and resistance to universality, open and closed technologies — located in infrastructure make it a valuable object of critical inquiry. DH can contribute to debates about modern infrastructure by offering unique humanities-centred theoretical and practice-led analyses of infrastructure and possessing the capacity to unlock a range of technical, socio-cultural, and political perspectives Infrastructural Interventions.

"CFP: Race, Medicine, and Health · Reviews in Digital Humanities","Race, Racism, and Health is a critical area in medical and health humanities that considers the historical development of racism and its effects on medical knowledge; access to care and treatment; and definitions of illness, health and wellness. In recent years, technology has further exposed not only linkages between structural racism, violence, and health outcomes but also the role technology plays in human-centered design in healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many of these issues to the forefront once again and inspires critical questions: How can computational methods combined with humanistic inquiry offer transformative understandings of the relationship between race, racism, and health? What are the sources, processes, and presentation decisions that define a digital humanities project on race, racism, and health, and what specific parameters and functionalities are applied? How can the impact of digital technologies on humanities research methods and approaches foster new theoretical frameworks and research techniques in race, racism and health? How can humanities methods and perspectives shape new approaches to race and racism within medical and health settings? We invite submissions from scholars, artists, community-based organizations, healthcare professionals, and others who use digital tools and humanities methods to address the intersections of race, medicine, and health, especially those with projects that use digital tools to intervene in or provide resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are particularly interested in projects on COVID-19 and intersecting crises (e.g. racial justice, voter suppression, anti-Asian hate, and white nationalism). In addition to the above-mentioned topics, we invite projects related to any aspect of health, medicine, and race in the digital humanities: practical experimentation, theorizing, cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary work, and new and relevant developments. Submissions are welcome from projects at all stages, with a minimal requirement that the project have a publicly viewable website that demonstrates the central methods and concerns of the project.  Submission Details Please send the following information to reviewsindigitalhumanities@gmail.com with “SI: RHM” in the subject line: The title and website URL for the project; Project director’s name, institutional affiliation, email address, and brief bio; and 100-word abstract for the project.  If your project is selected for inclusion in the special issue by the guest editors, you will be invited to contribute your project overview as part of the journal’s review process. If your project is not selected for the special issue, it may be invited for inclusion in another issue of the journal by the journal editors.",https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/cfp-race-medicine-health
Responding to COVID with Digital Humanities – CC 4th,"CC 4th Be sure to check out the current story at Bethel News: it features History professor Charlie Goldberg and his Advanced Digital Humanities students, who spent part of last fall using the tools they were learning in class to respond to the same pandemic that was reshaping life on campus. DH majors used photogrammetry to create 3D images of objects that connected to their experience of COVID-19. “As historians,” said Prof. Goldberg, “we know it can be easy to make sense of life in hindsight. But, when you’re in the midst of uncertainty, it can be hard to make sense of the mess. This project provided an opportunity for us to create a meaningful narrative from our pandemic experiences.” “The breadth and depth of students’ work showcases one of the primary strengths of the digital humanities,” concluded Bethel writer Jenny Hudalla: “its broad applicability to a variety of disciplines. Students in the program—who belong to majors as diverse as history, software engineering, psychology, business, art, biblical and theological studies, philosophy, graphic design, and media production—learn to fuse the search for knowledge about human culture with a greater understanding of digital-age skills. By bringing the expertise of their primary major into contact with other disciplines, Goldberg says, they develop the ability to innovate alongside peers from different backgrounds—and they become more compelling candidates to future employers.” Read the full article here.

Scottish Graduate School for Arts & Humanities - Summer School 2021 - Intl Summer School 2021 Sessions (Tuesday) - Transnational History as Spatial History: the case of the Esperanto Movement ...,"English is today’s Globish. Today, English is the language that eases international trade, cross-border and cross-cultural communication. English is part and parcel of the most recent phase of globalisation and internationalism since post 1945. While there are pragmatic, historical, and linguistic reasons for English as the globally dominant language, such dominance is not without problems as a language – along with its cultural implications – imposes hierarchies. The native speaker will always be in a dominant cultural position vis-à-vis the non-native speaker. Around 1900 English was not yet the dominant global language. French was in decline to some extent. German made up ground in the sciences and engineering during a phase of rapid industrialisation in the later nineteenth century, yet it was deemed as too complex to take over. It was the auxiliary, planned language Esperanto that promised to fill that void around 1900 as a universal second language. Esperanto was devised as an easy to learn and neutral language. As such it deliberately did not carry any culturally hegemonic context with it. Esperanto was born in East Central Europe. It was the Polish-Jewish doctor Ludwik Zamenhof, a native of Białystok in Tsarist Russia (today’s Poland) who designed the language and published the first language manuals in the late 1880s. The language quickly found followers not only in Russia but in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Great Britain, Bohemia, Serbia and beyond Europe, for instance in Japan and China. Between 1900 and 1914 hundreds of local Esperanto groups sprang up. Journals were founded alongside national organisations. In 1905, when the first annual international congress was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France, more than 8,500 Esperantists attended the congresses before 1914. By 1910 it was taught in 320 schools in 17 countries, with more than 1,200 cities and towns offering evening classes. The Esperanto movement around 1900 can be characterised as a loose and geographically broad transnational network of local internationalists. Among these were prominent professional groups including teachers, lawyers, engineers, doctors, and architects. This workshop aims at providing an insight into the Esperanto movement in the early twentieth century. It will showcase a transnational historical perspective in theory and practice. The workshop is based on selected secondary reading focusing on transnational actors. Based around a number of selected primary sources (member lists, Esperanto journals, correspondence, postcards, congress participation) it will give an insight into archival practices, the ‘paper trail’ of transnational sources, as well as into different Digital History methods (datasets, databases, mapping and visualization).

Open Access Monograph Bursary for early career DH researchers by DARIAH – Archives Portal Europe Blog,"DARIAH-EU is launching an annual Open Access Book Bursary for the publication of one’s first monograph within the domain of Digital Humanities. The bursary will fund the Open Access publication of one monograph (or other long form of scholarship) per year. By doing so, DARIAH-EU aims to further strengthen its long-standing commitment to pave pathways to the open research culture as it specifically pertains to arts and humanities disciplines and to enable early career researchers, who are usually less privileged in institutional Open Access grants, to openly disseminate their first monographs in book series that are topically most relevant for their field of interest. The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond. For more details about the considerations behind the call, eligibility criteria and how to apply, go to https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/14/dariah-is-launching-an-annual-open-access-monograph-bursary-for-early-career-researchers-in-digital-humanities/ Fill in your details below or  an icon to log in:

Digital Humanities @ Oxford Summer School | Digital Scholarship @ Oxford,"Supporting innovative digital research In 2021, we held our largest ever summer school, fully virtual for the second year. In 2022 we are looking forward to welcoming you back to Oxford in person, giving you the opportunity to engage with experts in the Digital Humanities on a wide range of topics alongside students and researchers at every stage of their career path. The event will take place at Keble College, Oxford, from 11-15 July, with morning lectures and afternoon interactive workshops. We will also be live-streaming the morning sessions in a virtual strand of the Summer School, for those unable to attend in person. Booking for the 2022 Summer School has not yet opened. Sign up for our mailing list to be the first to know when tickets are available. Our 2022 Summer School offers more lectures, talks and workshops than ever before. As well as our live-streamed introductory lectures, we will have special talks giving a comprehensive tour of Digital Humanities, and in-person workshops every afternoon to develop your practical DH skills. See below for more details on each of these strands. Our selection of keynote lectures from leading Digital Humanists will be announced shortly. This lecture-based survey strand gives you a thorough overview of the theory and practice of Digital Humanities. Drawing on expertise from across the University of Oxford and our national and international collaborators, and on the University's library collections, it will appeal to anyone new to the field, or curious to broaden their understanding of the range of work the Digital Humanities encompass. Those attending in person will participate in sessions each morning and afternoon including the lectures, but will also participare in additional demonstrations and practical workshops each afternoon. Those attending online will join lectures each morning and be able  to ask questions to the lecturers digitally.  On completing this course, you will be conversant with the variety and potential of the various technologies used to collate, interrogate, and facilitate digital work in the Humanities. You will also have gained insight and practice in methods relevant to your own research.  No prior technical knowledge is necessary for this course. Participants are not required to bring their own laptops but may find it useful. What happens when archives become digital? How are digital archives made? Who does it? Where do they do it? And why? In the course of addressing some of these questions, this strand will help its participants to frame and negotiate some of the major considerations in making and working with digital and digitalised archives. Through practical sessions and theoretical discussions, participants will gain insight into the possibilities and challenges presented by digital archives and working with cultural heritage materials digitally. Working with both digitised and born digital materials, participants will be introduced to a number of core concepts and digital tools for collecting, cleaning and processing data for and from digital archives, as well as open-source solutions that can be used for cataloging, enriching, and publishing digital and digitised materials Hands-on sessions will be complemented by lecture and seminar-style discussions of issues surrounding digital archival practice. These will help participants to frame the creation and use of digital archives within their theoretical, political, ethical, cultural, and technical contexts, and enable them to make more informed decisions in their future interactions with digital archives.   There are no specific skills requirements for this strand, and it is designed to suitable for anyone working with archives and their digital counterparts. This workshop is an introduction to the theories and practices of capturing, querying, and publishing information online using the Linked Data method. Participants will learn about the theory behind Linked Data, and discuss challenges, opportunities, and the ethical considerations in using this methodology. During the workshop, participants will complete the workflow for converting tabular data into RDF (the Linked Data format). Each participant must bring a laptop (not a tablet!) with the required software pre-installed. Please check that you have administrative rights to install software on your machine. This workshop will consider public, collaborative research methods, particularly crowdsourcing, in the context of digital humanities. Aimed at researchers of all backgrounds, participants will engage with current and historical issues around crowdsourcing; propose, evaluate and discuss individual projects of their own making; and learn about best practices for social engagement with volunteers, long-term project health and sustainability. Participants will leave with a greater understanding of how to approach crowdsourced research in a way that balances data quality and ethical volunteer engagement. Over the course of the week, in addition to discussion and reflection, participants will design and build a crowdsourcing project prototype with their own dataset, using the Zooniverse Project Builder. Participants should arrive for the workshop prepared with a project concept and example data (for example, 50 digital images of objects, books, or contents of archival collections—an ideal dataset is one for which the same line of questioning can be applied to each image). Participants will discuss their projects and the design and building process with the group. Morning sessions on this strand will be lecture and discussion-based, afternoon work sessions will allow participants to incorporate concepts from the morning sessions into their own crowdsourcing projects. This workshop combines taught and practical sessions with case-studies introducing the use of the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), with a focus on the representation and publishing of primary sources. TEI is a very broad and flexible standard, so we will also concentrate on how TEI can best be used in specific research contexts.  We will showcase a number of projects in the fields of digital editing, text-analysis and publication. Case studies will cover both specific textual phenomena and those common to diverse media and genres. Core aspects of TEI to be covered in the hands-on exercise sessions include structural elements of texts, metadata, representing people, places, dates and groups, the transcription and description of documents, encoding correspondence, and how to query, transform and publish your texts. No previous experience with markup, XML, TEI, or editing is assumed. Participants will leave with a grounding based on practical experience in what the TEI can do to represent both the physical and the linguistic features of documents, how it can inform the analysis of texts, and how it can form part of a publication pathway. This strand introduces methods for recording, analysing and displaying cultural heritage (sites, material and visual culture). This includes the digital capture of objects, the creation of 3D models, and the employment of these models in interactive immersive experiences. No pre-requisite knowledge. Software will have to be downloaded prior to the course. This strand introduces a variety of approaches to dealing with humanities data. It covers modelling, structuring, and working with data, plus longer-term curation and preservation. Data types discussed include textual, tabular, image-based and time-based media. Attendees will hear from presenters experienced in working with these methods, and be given the opportunity to try some of them for themselves via practical exercises. The goal is to equip researchers to select solutions that will work for them.  Each participant is recommended to bring a laptop (not a tablet!). Please check that you have administrative rights to install software on your machine. This hands-on workshop offers an introduction to natural language processing in Python, from processing texts to extracting meaning from them, as well as the basics of automated semantic analysis with machine learning. We will focus on practical applications (from preprocessing texts to enriching them with linguistic knowledge via part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing) and we will show how to work with raw, semi-structured, and tabular data. We will show the basics of topic modelling, and how this technique can be used for humanities research in order to explore the content of large collections. Finally, we will provide an overview of semantic analysis using word embeddings, and how this technique can be used for a large variety of humanities research, such as tracking semantic change or understanding biases in a corpus. At the end of the workshop, participants will have acquired basic practical skills and knowledge on how Python can be used for processing humanities textual data. They will leave with an understanding of key aspects of natural language processing and how these can be applied to their research in the humanities.  No prior knowledge of Python or natural language processing is required. However, participants may find this workshop difficult to follow if they are not acquainted with the basic concepts of text analysis in digital humanities. This workshop offers an introduction to data analysis techniques of practical use to humanities scholars and GLAM professionals. Topics include: data formats (XML, JSON), the Python data analysis stack (Pandas), how to get from messy to tidy data, basics of data analysis and visualization, advanced topics (modelling) and applications (topic modelling), best practices to communicate and share your results (licensing, repositories). Classes are hands-on and interactive, as we will work with real-world examples of metadata (e.g., the British Library catalog), text (e.g., historical newspapers) and relational data (e.g., social networks). Attendees will have the opportunity to work on their own projects and/or on proposed exercises.   This is an advanced workshop: exposure to Python and the basics of scripting is strongly recommended. This could be acquired for example via previous attendance of the Text2Tech workshop or equivalent courses or self-learning.

Digital Humanities Tilburg – TSHD Digital Humanities Symposium,"June 29 & 30, 2022 How do we calibrate or modulate our (dis)trust when it comes to sources of information, given limited resources of time and attention? How do we decide what sources and voices to trust in our present media landscape, where an unprecedented number of resources for (mis)information and entertainment is available?  Why do people with different worldviews interpret the same data differently, or have altogether different views on what constitutes factual information in the first place?   In our ‘post-truth age’, public opinion appears less influenced by objective facts and more by personal beliefs. Companies, media, and influencers enter into competition for capturing and retaining our attention.  In both online and offline media, we see a blurring of the lines between factual and fictional discourse.  Online echo chambers and algorithmic biases lead to a pervasive influence of confirmation bias and filter bubbles.  Increasing political polarization and the mainstreaming of conspiracy thought amount to a deep-seated distrust of groups outside of the own community, and of things as they seem. In journalism, fact checking is often posed as an objective remedy to this fake news crisis, while traditional gatekeepers like mainstream journalistic media, experts, and scientists have lost some of their standing. The question of truth seems to increasingly be replaced by the question ‘who tells the most compelling story?’ This two-day symposium brings together scholars from a range of disciplines, including Philosophy, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cultural, Literary and Media Studies, Communication and Information Sciences, and Cognitive Science, to engage in a cross-disciplinary dialogue on these matters. The event includes a range of talks as well as a couple of interactive workshops on key methodological tools for Digital Humanities research. Times of rapid transformation can give us the opportunity to rethink our fields of research and education as well as their main concepts and values. With this event, we aim to answer such questions from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. We invite speakers to present on a broad range of topics including, but not limited to, the cognitive (e.g., studies of beliefs and bias), arts and media (e.g., truth and fiction in literature, television and film, or news websites), philosophical (e.g., the ontology and semantics of fact and fiction), Artificial Intelligence (e.g., virtual reality; algorithmic creativity; automatic analyses of discourse to trace polarization, fake news, content featuring conspiracy theories and others) and  communication and information studies (e.g., online misinformation; the role of truth-finding on social media). Submitted papers should feature digital humanities methods or include reflections on digital media and technologies. This two-day, hybrid symposium—part on-site at the campus of Tilburg University, part online—brings together scholars from a range of disciplines, including Philosophy, Culture Studies, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cultural, Literary and Media Studies, Communication and Information Sciences, and Cognitive Science, to engage in a cross-disciplinary dialogue on these matters. The event includes keynotes, a range of talks, and a number of specialist panels on Digital Humanities research.   Keynote speakers:  Emar Maier (University of Groningen)  Miriam Metzger (UC Santa Barbara)  Martina Raponi (Willem de Kooning Academy)  Dirk Hovy (Bocconi University) Submit a 300-word anonymized abstract (excluding references), consisting of the title and a short description of your proposed paper to Easychair by April 15, 2022. This symposium is organized by Inge van de Ven (TSHD, Department of Culture Studies), Sander Verhaegh (TSHD, Department of Philosophy), Giovanni Cassani (TSHD, Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence), Frédéric Tomas (TSHD, Department of Communication and Cognition), assisted by Rebecca de Jongh. The event is funded by the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences (TSHD) , Tilburg University, the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Analysis, and the Netherlands Research School for Literary Studies.  Tilburg University

 Three renowned researchers in digital humanities and computer science are joining forces with the Library of Congress on three inaugural Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud projects, exploring how biblical quotations, photographic styles and “fuzzy searches” reveal more about the collections in the world’s largest Library than first meets the eye.Supported by a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded in 2019, the initiative combines cutting edge technology with the Library’s vast collections to support digital humanities research at scale. These three outside researchers will collaborate with subject matter experts and technology specialists at the Library of Congress to experiment in pursuit of answers that can only be achieved with collections and data at scale. These collaborations will enable research on questions previously difficult to address due to technical and data constraints. Expanding the skills and knowledge necessary for this work will enable the Library to support emerging methods in cloud-based computing research such as machine learning, computer vision, interactive data visualization, and other areas of digital humanities and computer science research. As a result, the Library and other cultural heritage institutions may build upon or adapt these approaches for their own use in improving access to text and image collections. “We know there’s so much more treasure to be unlocked here at the Library and in institutions across the country and around the world, and technology can help us understand these collections even more,” said Kate Zwaard, director of digital strategy at the Library of Congress. “We want to generate evidence that we can use to make decisions and invest in our future, and we also hope that this work is useful for others to use and adapt in their own organizations.”The three experts beginning work this month are:Lincoln Mullen, associate professor at George Mason University in the Department of Art and Art History and director of computational history at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, will research “America’s Public Bible: Machine-Learning Detection of Biblical Quotations Across LOC Collections via Cloud Computing.” Dr. Mullen is no stranger to Library collections, having won first place in the 2016 Chronicling America Data Challenge.Lauren Tilton is an assistant professor of digital humanities at the University of Richmond in the Department of Rhetoric & Communication Studies and is co-director of Photogrammar and the Distant Viewing Lab. Tilton’s project, “Access & Discovery of Documentary Images” will examine approximately 250,000 images from five early 20th century photography collections. The project will look for ways computer vision methods could be improved to better consider context and enhance discovery.Andromeda Yelton, a software engineer and professionally trained librarian, will research “Situating Ourselves in Cultural Heritage: Using Neural Nets to Expand the Reach of Metadata and See Cultural Data on Our Own Terms.” Yelton’s project will create an interactive data visualization that clusters conceptually similar documents, helping users who only have a rough idea of the items they’re looking for. The project will use a searching capability that utilizes machine learning and “fuzzy search” to help users discover and navigate Library collections.In addition to the generosity of the Mellon Foundation, the Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud initiative is bolstered by the Library’s significant investments in IT modernization. In late 2020, the Library transitioned to a hybrid hosting environment consisting of multiple secure physical data centers and the cloud. The initiative will test a cloud-based approach for interacting with and exploring digital collections as data.The public can follow along with these experiments on the Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud page at LC Labs.Through experimentation, research, collaboration, and reflection, LC Labs works to realize the Library’s vision that “all Americans are connected to the Library of Congress” by enabling the Library’s Digital Strategy.
