You will work within the project Art DATIS (Digital Art Technical sources for the Netherlands: Integration and improvement of sources on glass for a Sustainable future). Art DATIS is a research project (2018-2023) within the NWO Big Data/Digital Humanities programme. The project is a collaboration between the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam, RKD Netherlands Institute for Art History, the Free Glass Foundation, and Picturae. The production of free glass saw significant technological innovations in the twentieth century. Dutch glass artist Sybren Valkema’s (1916-1996) study of historical sources and his practical work contributed crucially to these innovations. What role did historical sources on the changing production of glass in Europe between 1500 and 1996 play in his work? How did he use these sources to innovate technology and education? Within the project these archives are enriched and linked to open data to answer these questions. One postdoctoral position is available for a Researcher in digital humanities. In collaboration with data scientists based at the University of Amsterdam (headed by Prof Evangelos Kanoulas) you will be responsible for the development of digital tools to make the archive accessible, and to conduct (technical art) historical research making use of these tools and the archives, to the project’s central questions about the history of glass technology and art education.

Nazmus Saquib - Digital Humanities: Reflection;"January 25, 2021 On January 27th, the Islamicate Digital Humanities Network (IDHN) will organize a conference that will showcase a lot of my team’s research on understanding Hadiths as a narrative network. This is a special moment for all of us in the team, and definitely a milestone for me because I have been working on this meaty idea for close to a decade with my mentor/collaborator Mairaj Syed.  We have come together as a team (along with other colleagues) many times over the years to brainstorm, read, write code, visualize, and ponder about the implications of our results. I had the opportunity to attend and give talks in quite a few humanities workshops, conferences, and classes. I also read many papers in religious studies and worked with a few humanities researchers for this and other projects, so I feel comfortable to comment on the best practices for fruitful collaborations. In this post, I will summarize my understanding of the two very distinct cultures (sciences and humanities) as a scientist. This is solely based on my personal experience, but I hope it might help both sides of digital humanities to understand each other and manage expectations. Hadiths are a major source of available narratives on early middle eastern history. It is a huge body of narrations about the sayings of the Islamic prophet (and others) on different events and phenomena, that transmitters passed down from one generation to another (this claim is both refuted and supported by different evidences), and different generations recorded these in different books. Hadiths have far reaching implications to this day, as they often influence legal, cultural, political, and social decision making in the Muslim world, and they are also entangled with other cultures that are trying to understand Islam. The dynamics of these narratives reveal very important historical insights and provide a lens into the authenticity of the narratives and historical claims. I was an undergraduate student at Bard College (NY) studying physics and computer science when I met Mairaj in 2011. He was teaching an advanced Islamic Legal Theory class that I took. Even though science and engineering students often complain about their humanities classes and I was no different initially, the liberal arts culture at Bard slowly changed my views. I was drawn towards the humanities and was increasingly taking advanced humanities classes to fulfill my requirements, instead of the usual introductory classes science students take to get by.  Mairaj was a young professor, fresh out of Princeton with a PhD in religious studies, and I would approach him after the classes to talk about the kind of research they do in general. Mairaj used to be a student of information management and knew some coding and databases, so unlike many other humanities professors he would enthusiastically discuss possibilities in digital humanities research. We explored a few things in 2011 and 2012 on Isnads and Matn (information on how transmitters passed the Hadith literature). I wrote some code to combine Matns, and discussed results with Mairaj, but that was pretty much it. The project seemed to die down. After I left Bard to pursue a Master’s in Computing, I was increasingly drawn towards Network Science. In 2013, I reached back to Mairaj with the idea that we could interpret the Hadith literature as a social network of transmitters. Mairaj moved to UC Davis at the time. We collaborated again to explore some preliminary results in centrality metrics in the Hadith network. Mairaj was not an expert in any of web scraping, data mining, or network science, but over the next few years he taught himself a lot of the tricks by studying my and other people’s code.  When I started my PhD at MIT, we made an informal habit of visiting each other at MIT or UC Davis, and would have these few-days long hackathons where I would code non-stop and Mairaj would organize our data into better databases or historically interpret the computational results. We would discuss results and visualizations and talk about writing a book together. In fact, in 2015 I received a book offer from Princeton University Press, but we were not entirely sure if we could commit the time required for such a project so we passed the offer after drafting some parts of the book. From 2016, we doubled down on our efforts and made consistent progress. New members would join our team regularly. Some left and some stayed. Mairaj took care of all the management, with occasional support from myself. We started writing and getting grants. We eventually had some excellent technical people in the team (Danny Halawi, Mohamed Alkaoud, and recently Shuaib Choudhry) so I did not have to do heavy lifting on coding the analytics infrastructure anymore. We also had other humanities researchers give us feedback and discuss our work over long sessions. At this point, I shifted my attention and time to some of the theoretical questions that I have been exploring since the beginning, such as, what does the overall structure and dynamics of the Hadith network look like? What does it say about the current notions of Hadith transmission and disputes on early-Islamic history? I attended history and religious studies workshops and conferences since 2014, presenting my research on these questions. At the moment, our work's portfolio includes 1400 parsed books, with 50,000 authors and millions of links between them, and a collection of data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the narration dynamics in this huge network. Note that this was not my PhD research. My main interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Science, Interactive Computing, Design, and Wearable Sensors. However, I have been very passionate about this project, and whenever I got a chance or needed a break from my PhD work I would work on this. Having read some other religious studies PhD works, I feel comfortable to say that the impact of our team’s Hadith analytics works could be equated to several PhDs. I would not dare call it a second PhD for myself because I know my readings are not at the level of an actual humanities PhD. However, having done a lot of scattered readings over the years, I do entertain the idea at times that I should take a religion PhD qualifying exam to figure out where I am really at in this regard. With the background out of the way, let me summarize a few key differences between the sciences and humanities cultures. When speaking about science, I speak from experience in the CS, Physics, and Applied Math communities, but I have heard and read many stories from other science PhDs that I feel comfortable to make some general statements. Publication expectations: Probably the first thing a scientist (especially a computer scientist) would find surprising in the humanities land is the pace of publications. While quantity of papers doesn't reflect quality, computer scientists are used to submitting substantial new works and ideas to conferences every year. The pace at first may seem slow in a digital humanities collaboration.  One reason maybe is just the nature of research. Often times writing 500 lines of code to deal with a dataset is much easier than reading through big volumes of text and understanding the nuances presented by their authors. Even though coding clever algorithms is no small task, the humanities works often are the long and tedious ones. The other reasons for such prolific activity in the sciences have good and bad causal forces. The bad force is how money and grants are set up in the current system. The outcomes of grants are usually publications, and there is more money allocated for science/engineering. Therefore, many “garbage papers” are written in abundance in a “prolific” field like computer science to keep the money flowing. Even good scientists often feel pressured to churn out useless papers, and ignoring that mindset is a challenge when you are aiming for a job market.  Having said that, I think there is room for improvement in the humanities too, where the sciences are more or less doing it right. It boils down to team-based work. Team culture: The research works in humanities are often done by lone rangers, instead of large international collaborations and teams that are frequently seen in the sciences. For no-BS prolific scientists, frequent publications is the way to disseminate knowledge asap and open it up for critique, and science appears to move faster because of that. The challenge for a reader is to then filter through the incremental works described in #1 and find these gems. Once you build a reputation as a no-BS scientist/team, it’s easier to just find and follow your work.  This kind of international teamwork mindset could be adapted in the humanities too, with better means of knowledge distribution. Problem selection: When dealing with theory, I personally favor research in the Pasteur’s Quadrant, fundamental research that has applied use cases. Search for a never-ending series of abstractions — ignoring the human meaning making process — sometimes seems redundant to me. It is a view that I share with Sabine Hossenfelder, and this style of research seems to be prevalent among many theorists.  Interestingly, I think I have seen this trend in both the humanities and sciences. Without pointing out specific works, I would just say that the premature search for can-explain-it-all theories is quite abundant in both fields, whereas we should first look for provable hypotheses that may or may not generalize all too well. That is part of doing science. Superiority/Inferiority complex around technology: A recipe for disaster is to build an interdisciplinary team whose members don't know (or trust) each other’s strengths, or don't have the capability to understand the available strengths properly. Some scientists might think they are the genius here and doing others a favor. At the same time, humanities scholars may get excited at the prospect of applying technical methods without understanding the methods and their implications completely. It is inevitable for a new interdisciplinary team, and I was fortunate that in our team none of these happened, except occasional tensions at times.  I have observed such trends in other collaborations though. I have often seen HCI collaborations where a more technical person (say, a machine learning theorist) would be the person holding back the less technical but more humanities/social science oriented researchers, who may be waiting for the technical person to apply some cool techniques on their hard-earned, curated datasets. However, applying a cool method may not answer the question at hand, but both parties don’t seem to care as this might get them a new paper. To do good research, we need to understand each other’s works better. A corollary to this is that good team spirit in this realm means maintaining a delicate balance of trust and doubt, which brings me to my next point. Teacher and Colleague: In a good digital humanities collaboration, each person is both. As a teacher, you have to sometimes direct with certainty, but as a colleague you have to listen and trust. In our work, Mairaj’s subject matter expertise and mentorship guided my investigations. However, my emphasis on certain techniques paid off, and Mairaj had to trust me on my mathematical instincts on his subject matter. Presentation: This is a very minor but funny one. Let’s just say I was not impressed by slides with poor visual choices, such as cyan/purple backgrounds, full of yellow and red colored text, with no pictures, that some North American humanities professors were just reading out loud in some conference sessions. While I did see very good quality presentations in the same conferences, I didn’t realize slides that can instantly make you fall asleep could be part of the same sessions. You say I shouldn’t judge from a few conferences? I agree, but it was unexpected nonetheless. I am used to seeing demo videos with published papers, and well crafted slides for presentations in HCI. So naturally I would expect that professors who teach in US universities do not just read their slides that are full of text. Dissemination of knowledge in widely understandable and enjoyable formats should be prioritized by any researcher. I am not entirely qualified to comment on such a huge topic, but I can talk about this philosophy from the perspective of cognitive science and embodied mathematics, a field that formed the backbone of my PhD dissertation. To begin to understand the philosophical differences between sciences and humanities, and to act on reducing our existing biases and assumptions, we perhaps need to understand the nature of mathematical abstractions first. A. The nature of abstractions: Mathematics is feared by many, and a lot of works in the digital humanities require some level of mathematical maturity (coding is a form of mathematics too). The reason most people often feel lost in this land is because the gradual layers of abstractions and metaphors are often too many to form a coherent mental model. Let me explain with a diagram from my PhD dissertation. This is a rough sequence of mathematical abstractions that we are introduced to over a general learning trajectory in STEM. Embodied math is the domain that most humans understand naturally (object collection, shapes, drawing, manipulating small collections). The progression of subsequent mathematical reasoning is often based on abstractions that are introduced as metaphors. This view is championed by cognitive scientists.  The abstractions are often composed of layers of metaphors. For example, to really understand an algebra equation, you have to understand common metaphors in algebra, such as ""variables are boxes containing objects and each box can count how many objects are inside"", or + and - are the equivalent of adding or removing objects from the box. Just like a language, the metaphors can vary. Different metaphors may lead to the same outcome, and you can chain different metaphors together to get to an abstract concept. To put it simply, math is a collection of layers of metaphors. To understand math as a whole, we  need to establish connections between each metaphor, and at some point the layers may become cognitively arbitrary for many unless you actively trained to keep the connections in mind, which happens very rarely.  This is not only true for math. This is in fact true for any spoken language (George Lakoff's book Metaphors We Live By shows excellent examples of how a language is a collection of grounded symbols and layers of metaphors on top of these symbols), music (check out Adam Neely's excellent video ""what does music mean"" to understand how musical compositions are metaphors), sketching and drawing (check out Part V of the book Symbol Formation (1963)), etc. Sign game: mathematical rules can be arbitrary and context based. This does not only pose a cognitive challenge for the beginners, experts can be the victims of this trap too. Often a veteran computer scientist might use a wrong method because the context for the problem is different than what she thought the rules suggest. Sometimes the rules create new context, especially if you are always relying on the rules to guide yourself in making meaning. Wittgenstein called this phenomenon sign game. To put it simply, when you are relying on abstractions and not thinking through the metaphorical layers, there are chances that the shortcuts you are taking in your reasoning might land you in the wrong interpretation regions. B. Implications of abstractions: The way humans create meaning and form abstractions have profound implications in science, math, and humanities cultures. Any mathematical analysis of an event that is perceived by a human requires translating the event into symbolic abstractions, constructing the necessary layers of metaphors along the way. On your way back from the abstraction land to embodied meaning making, you may introduce some more metaphors and context that may or may not be consistent with the existing ones that you used on your way in. The same could be said about the humanities when a scholar applies a certain framework (say, a form of exegesis, feminism, a political theory etc.) to an event to make some nuanced meaning out of it. When viewed from this perspective, both data scientists and humanities scholars have something to be humble about. However, the burden is often more on the number-crunching folks. Translating embodied, perceived versions of events to an abstraction through metaphors is a tricky task. A data scientist treating numbers and data analysis as the truth will often fall into the trap of wrong interpretation, and this happens so often that it is embarrassing, and our predictions may turn out to be wrong. Does it mean we stop predicting using numbers? No. Mathematical abstractions are powerful tools for thinking and taking shortcuts in the process of ""meaning making"". What would be lifetime works of thousands of Hadith scholars, data mining, machine learning, and analytics can potentially turn that into a few days worth of work. However, it comes with the risk of wrong interpretations and predictions, or missing out nuances. A good approach to any problem is therefore to examine it from both perspectives. There is no greater or smaller work here. Stop thinking you are special if you know how to crunch numbers and many others don't! You simply are an expert in connecting some metaphor layers, and others can connect other forms of metaphors. I say this because I am tired of seeing how we, the computer scientists, are over-praised, and are over-confident about what we do to ""change the world"" in the name of innovation. Computer Science has given us very powerful tools and metaphors to model the world's information, but it comes with its own baggage. C. How do we get out of the abstractions trap? One possible way, out of a few, is to design better tools that take human cognition and cultures into account. Good tools would take away the headache of connecting the layers of metaphors, and/or make the connections between the layers clear for different contexts. This could eventually help both sides of digital humanities. Scientists use computational tools heavily, and the artifact(s) produced by these tools is their window into interpreting the reality. Tools that retain explainability is therefore the key, and such design efforts require collaboration between designers, algorithmists, and humanities scholars. You can read about how I approach this problem in my research on embodied math. The abstractions used in qualitative and quantitative research are fundamentally different. Each type of abstraction has its strengths and weaknesses. Some abstractions require more training than others, but I believe well designed tools can mitigate this problem eventually in the future. We also need a culture of appreciation for different abstractions. Just because I am connecting metaphor layers that some others have not trained for, does not mean they are connecting concepts, contexts, and metaphors that I will understand right away. So no one job is essentially “easy” or “hard”, it boils down to which abstractions your culture made you think were superior. As for the cultural differences I stated here, I hope these kinds of discussions will happen more, so the work and collaboration cultures become easier for both technical and humanities scholars.

UC San Diego Tommie Camarillo, Chair of the Chicano Park Steering Committee (CPSC), Stewards of Chicano Park, for over 40 years, has maintained an extensive library/archive of the history of Chicano Park. Chicano Park and the Chicano Park Monumental murals located in Barrio Logan/Logan Heights in San Diego, California is a National Landmark (2016) and listed on the National Register (2013). The archive/library documents a community’s self-determination to defy the City of San Diego and the State of California to build their own park in response to the Intrusion of Interstate 5 and the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge that displaced 75 percent of the residents in less than 14 years. The Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center’s Logan Heights Archival project is to digitize and inventory the Tomasa Camarillo archive/library of Chicano Park and Community history and to highlight a unique archival method embodied in the life of Tommie Camarillo and rooted in community values and empowerment that comes from the heart.

UC San Diego Co-PI: Diana SolisVisual Artist, Photographer & EducatorChicago, IL[Photo by Lucas Anti] The Latino Catskills is a digital project that resituates the rural Catskills region, located 100 miles northwest of New York City, as a generative space of Latino culture and identities. As this project documents, from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s, the Catskill mountains were a popular summer destination for countless Spaniards, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and others of Latin American descent. These Latino travelers took day trips (known as giras) or stayed at private dwellings and the many resorts owned by fellow Spanish speakers, such as the historic “Villas Hispanas” in Plattekill, New York. Our project reconstructs this important archive of Latino leisure culture through the development of a digital archive and map. By telling the stories of these forgotten sites, the project recenters recreation and leisure as important social components of the Latino experience, complementing dominant narratives of New York Latinidad, which have traditionally focused on the racialized experiences of urban poverty and toil.

University of Miami Libraries (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas: The Aida Barrera Digital Project highlights Aida Barrera’s career as creator of Carrascolendas. Through a close study of Carrascolendas, a bilingual children’s show produced during the 1970s in Austin, Texas, this digital humanities project demonstrates how Barrera, like other Latinas in the United States, engaged in social activism and contributed to race, gender and labor equality. While contextualizing Carrascolendas within broader histories, this project emphasizes the significance of Barrera’s labor and agency as a Latina in television production during the late twentieth century and examines how the Chicano and Civil Rights Movements influenced her approach to bilingual education. Additionally, (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas contributes to a wider understanding of race, gender, migration and language in the US-Mexico borderlands by underlining the immediate and long-term significance of Carrascolendas for Latino audiences.

Lone Star College-North Harris, Houston El primer número del periódico La voz se publicó en Nueva York en julio de 1937, estableciendo desde su editorial que se trataba de una empresa de intenciones democráticas. La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años. Su trabajo intelectual sirve de base para el estudio de las fuertes conexiones entre feminismo y antifascismo que los artículos de La voz ponen de evidencia.

University of Connecticut #MAOD1889 is defined as the Modesta Avila: Obstructing Development Since 1889 multimedia, digital-arts project. Modesta Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Mexican/Mexican American folks. There are various versions of Modesta Avila's life and the various actions she took in the late 1880s to keep the Santa Fe Railroad from developing on her family's land, which was located in in the same region of what is now the San Juan Capistrano Train Station. The project will trace and focus on Modesta Avila’s life via a virtual timeline, a research contribution to the Recovery Program via their Omeka site and augmented reality. #MAOD1889 builds movement culture by preserving and re-presenting history from a people of color (POC) point of view. Among academic documentation, #MAOD1889 cites relevant photos, historical documents, media publications and urban tales from the community and local POC artists who have focused on Modesta Avila’s mugshot image to produce contemporary work. The archives will be used to source an online and book publication as well as a live hologram presentation. Through the use of the digital humanities, #MAOD1889 will provide readers and researchers the opportunity to scan the images with their phones and witness Modesta Avila come to life to tell her own story.

University of California-Berkeley The Puerto Rican Literature Project is a digital archive that maps the literary production of Puerto Rican writers from the archipelago and the diaspora since the Jones Act. It contains various photos, ephemera, and images of manuscripts in progress, some of which are housed at the archive at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, where a portion of this project began at a summer fellowship. In addition, we are creating various free digital teaching aids that educators can use to teach Puerto Rican literature in the classroom. Finally, the project will feature a page documenting the work of contemporary Puerto Rican writers through interviews, scholarly essays, craft talks, and book reviews.

92Y's Unterberg Poetry Center This project emphasizes the recovery of Ramírez’s maternal abuela’s writings. Her abuela, doña Ramona González, was born in El Paso, Texas in 1906 and wrote short stories, poems, fables, dichos, and more in 1960 – 1975. As an early Chicana writer, she published some of her writings in the important Chicano literary journal of El Grito’s (1967-1974) special issue Chicanas en la literatura y el arte of 1973. This project, however, focuses on doña Ramona’s seven hundred and fifty plus primary documents that she produced over her lifetime. Five years ago, the González/Hernández family (Ramírez’s immediate family) uncovered these documents tucked away in a cardboard box. These documents have now all been digitized, and a large majority have been translated by Dr. Ramírez’s father, Dr. Neil J. Devereaux. This project’s main goal is community accessibility of these primary document to the greater Latinx community. The Ramona González Papers Exhibit: The Ramona González Papers PI: Cristina Ramírez, PhD

University of Arizona This project understands 19th-century Latino publications from immigrant editors of Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico as fundamentally transnational phenomena engaged in the larger press networks of the Americas. The interactions between these three communities in the US often occurred in exchanges that have been lost or erased from the historical record despite their relevance to understanding how race and nationhood came to be understood locally and across national borders.

Morreale  (Harvard University)  The Medieval Academy announces that the 2022 Digital Humanities Award will be given to The Documentary Archeology of Late Medieval Europe (DALME).  This web-based research project was created to support the study of material culture of Europe from the thirteenth to the early sixteenth centuries .  Its dataset comprises inventories of various households and estates throughout Europe.  Although it only went online in January of 2021, the project houses over 500 records in twelve different languages.  Those records include ecclesiastical inventories, inventories from various regions in Italy, as well as inventories from Jewish households from Northern Europe. Each record includes a digital facsimile of the archival source, along with a diplomatic transcription of the relevant folios or pages (and in some cases published inventories that are no longer in copyright).  A second collection of individual objects is also part of the database, but this is still in the early stages.  DALME stood out amongst the other candidates because of three factors.  First, the web interface was well designed both aesthetically and functionally.  The user is able to navigate easily from record to record (and from page to page within a record).  In addition to a general search option, the dataset is well organized by coherent categories.  Each category also has a histogram to indicate how the records are clustered chronologically.  Second, the content is clearly scholarly and is the result of strong linguistic and paleographical skills of its contributors.  The quality of the content will ensure that this resource will be of use to both student and scholars.  As one referee noted, ""One of the happy consequences of this [project's] methodology is that DALME is useful to an interdisciplinary community of archaeologists, art historians, anthropologists, historians, linguists, and philologists, among others.""  Moreover, DALME has already been deployed in the classroom, which speaks to its diverse use and scholarly quality.  Finally,  DALME attends to the standards of open technologies and practices.  It has avoided using proprietary software and has adopted data standards already well established in the DH community. Moreover, those standards will provide opportunities for DALME's dataset to be integrated with other datasets using these same open standards, and this can open up future research opportunities.   This project also presented the best use of github in the storage and dissemination of the project.  While it is currently unclear if third-party applications can at present harvest from DALME's dataset, the infrastructure has already been established.  Such a strategy will ensure the longevity of this project when the project reaches its own terminus point.";https://zurl.co/bGFb;

La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años.

The Digital Black Atlantic — University of Minnesota Press;"Coming soon Roopika Risam and Kelly Baker Josephs, Editors  Exploring the intersections of digital humanities and African diaspora studies  This timely collection of essays about the relationship between digital humanities and Black Atlantic studies offers critical insights into race, migration, media, and scholarly knowledge production. It spans the African diaspora’s range—from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean—while its essayists span academic fields—from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies.

 How can scholars use digital tools to better understand the African diaspora across time, space, and disciplines? And how can African diaspora studies inform the practices of digital humanities? These questions are at the heart of this timely collection of essays about the relationship between digital humanities and Black Atlantic studies, offering critical insights into race, migration, media, and scholarly knowledge production.  The Digital Black Atlantic spans the African diaspora’s range—from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean—while its essayists span academic fields—from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies. This transnational and interdisciplinary breadth is complemented by essays that focus on specific sites and digital humanities projects throughout the Black Atlantic. Covering key debates, The Digital Black Atlantic asks theoretical and practical questions about the ways that researchers and teachers of the African diaspora negotiate digital methods to explore a broad range of cultural forms including social media, open access libraries, digital music production, and video games. The volume further highlights contributions of African diaspora studies to digital humanities, such as politics and representation, power and authorship, the ephemerality of memory, and the vestiges of colonialist ideologies.  Grounded in contemporary theory and praxis, The Digital Black Atlantic puts the digital humanities into conversation with African diaspora studies in crucial ways that advance both.

 Jan 27 Wed, 27 January 2021 17:00 – 19:00 GMT Online event Despite the professional caricature of historians being uninterested in technology, historians have had a long track record of engaging with born-digital sources. This has necessarily involved critical conversations around digital preservation and access. These early encounters were driven by a wave of digitally-aware historians in the 1960s and 1970s, who were then then relatively central within the historical profession. The interdisciplinary journal Computers and the Humanities was established in 1966, and indeed, by 1970 the prospects for “computer-assisted historical projects” suggested the possibility of a wholescale transformation of the discipline. This current peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s.  At the same time, archivists and librarians were exploring digital preservation in earnest. During these first conversations about electronic records, historians played a prominent role at the table, helping to shape the conversation. This interdisciplinary engagement helped to shape early digital preservation efforts. Conversations would continue into the web age, with impact on this turn to networked information. By the mid-1990s, a small group of economic historians – tracing their lineage back to these early encounters – would help underscore the need for digital preservation and source stewardship. Their arguments presaged contemporary ones around computational history, forming an essential part of the historical context for any history of the digital humanities in general and digital history specifically. Yet, by the late 1990s (with some exceptions), historians largely disappeared from the conversation – unfortunately at a time when they were needed more than ever. In this presentation, part of my broader project “Averting the Digital Dark Age,” I explore the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Electronic records, to these historians, imperilled society’s collective memory. What was to be done? All are welcome.  The event will run on Zoom. The link and passcode will be provided on your confirmation email when you register. This event is organised by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, which is part of the UCL Institute of Advanced Studies.

Excellent results can be achieved for any kind of writing, be it from the middle-ages or from the 20th century, be it English, German, Hebrew or Arabic. Users are able to train their own handwriting recognition models. Nearly 50,000 users are registered in the platform, more than 8000 Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models were trained in the last 2 years. Transkribus is run by the European Cooperative Society READ-COOP SCE. The University of Denver, as part of the first cohort in the Collections as Data: Part to Whole Mellon funded initiative in collaboration with the READ-COOP is hosting a workshop that  will introduce the main features of the Transkribus platform. Attendees will learn how to upload their documents to the platform, how to generate training data, how to train the HTR engine and how to apply their own models or existing ones. They will get some background knowledge on the technology used and what should be obeyed in order to get the best results. In the advanced part of the workshop they will also learn how to transform existing transcriptions from former projects into a format which can be used to train the Transkribus engine. Finally attendees will also get an insight into the web-applications for searching and displaying Transkribus documents on the web.

Her scholarly work focuses on utilizing visual analysis, historical perspectives, and interdisciplinary theories in order to understand the importance of art in cultural events and debates throughout history.  Through her course American Monument Cultures, Hutchinson invites students to examine the intersections between visual art and postcolonial studies and learn about the history of monument culture in the United States. “A monument that celebrates a slaveholder or a colonizer might seem to some to point merely to history, to the past,” Hutchinson said. “But for others who are experiencing the ongoing legacies of those violent histories, these symbols structure their comfort and ease moving through public space.” Students in Hutchinson’s course study historical contexts to understand the role of monuments in public spaces and created digital projects centering a monument’s impact on a city or town. They also learn how to integrate virtual story maps, timelines, and intensive research skills to produce projects that expand on course content.  Additionally, Hutchinson uses this course to emphasize the crucial link between activism and public visual art. “What I hope students will come to understand is that works of art are powerful and they speak to specific times and places,” she said. “I also want them to know that activism matters and to understand how change can take place in the [public art] landscape.” To learn more about Hutchinson’s American Monument Cultures course, watch the video above.  — SOLBY LIM ’22

Call for Participation: Digital Humanities Summer Institute Conference and Colloquium 2021 (Online!) – The Digital Humanities Commons;"Those of you who have been following the development of the DH Commons from the beginning will know that Professor Ray Siemens of the University of Victoria, Canada gave the keynote address at our DH Commons launch event in November 2019. Ray looms large as a figure in North American DH circles not just because of his scholarship but also because of the spirit of open-minded and friendly collaboration that he brings and encourages others to foster in the DH community.   As a part of that spirit, Ray is also the head of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at University of Victoria. Each year, the DHSI community comes together for two weeks in Victoria to participate in a series of foundational and advanced week-long workshops and conferences. This year, DHSI is transitioning to an online program, and as a part of that program there will be a conference and colloquium. This will consist of pre-recorded paper presentations ranging from 5 to 20 minutes in length. Topics for the papers can cover any field or discipline related to digital humanities and/or the application of digital methodologies to transform traditional research. The colloquium is actually a collection of conferences which include specific CFPs for the following topics: As yet there are also two associated events as part of the colloquium. These include a workshop on Research Data Management for Digitally Curious Humanists, hosted by Lisa Goddard ( U Victoria Libraries), Shahira Khair (U Victoria Libraries), and James Doiron (U Alberta Libraries). and the GraphPoem event hosted by UC Louvain’s Altissia Chair of Digital Humanities, Professor Chris Tananescu.  The online conference will take place during the two weeks of DHSI, which are scheduled during the weeks of 7-11 June and 14-18 June 2021. According the CFP, “[a]fter the event, we will invite participants to contribute papers to a special issue of Interdisciplinary Digital Engagements in Arts & Humanities (IDEAH), a peer-reviewed, online, open-access journal founded as a mechanism for distributing the innovative, engaging scholarship shared annually at DHSI.” Each of the above listed conferences within the colloquium has its own CFP, and the deadline for submissions for ALL of the CFPs is Thursday, February 25, 2021.

Introduction to Digital Humanities | edX;Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. As primary sources of information are more frequently digitized and available online than ever before, how can we use those sources to ask new questions? How did Chinese families organize themselves and their landscapes in China’s past? How did African slaves from different cultures form communities in the Americas? What influences informed the creation and evolution of Broadway musicals? How can I understand or interpret 1,000 books all at once? How can I create a visualization that my students can interact with? The answers to these questions can be explored using a wide variety of digital tools, methods, and sources.  As museums, libraries, archives and other institutions have digitized collections and artifacts, new tools and standards have been developed that turn those materials into machine-readable data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for example, have enabled humanities researchers to processvastamounts of textual data. However, these advances are not limited just to text. Sound, images, and video have all been subject to these new forms of research.  This course will show you how to manage the many aspects of digital humanities research and scholarship. Whether you are a student or scholar, librarian or archivist, museum curator or public historian — or just plain curious — this course will help you bring your area of study or interest to new life using digital tools.

Send us an email: visionaryfuturescollective@gmail.com  Using data to visualize campus responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Visionary Futures Collective brings together humanists across the United States to tackle challenges relating to the present and future of higher education.  This group is made up of scholars of the humanities. Many, but not all of us have or are currently pursuing graduate degrees. Many, but not all of us work or study at universities. Some, but not most of us, are professors. All of us believe in the transformational power and vital importance of the humanities. This group believes that the study of human history and cultural expression is essential to a more just and meaningful society. Our purpose is to create the conditions in which this work can thrive.   We begin with the premise that current conditions in higher education are incompatible with the work of the humanities. We formed at the start of the coronavirus pandemic because we understood that this public health crisis would exacerbate the structural inequities that characterize U.S. higher education. Our work is shaped by the long-overdue national reckoning with racial inequities led by the Black Lives Matter movement.   We believe that humanities labor must be carried out under conditions that do not put our lives or our health at risk. We believe that humanities labor is valuable, and must be credited and compensated fairly and equitably.  We believe the systems in higher education that depend on labor exploitation, racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, and other forms of oppression must be dismantled.   We believe that higher education should be for the public good, and that the work of the humanities should be conducted for and with our communities.  We recognize that these conditions will not be created through top-down change, and so we aim to build collective action from the bottom up.  We are constantly learning new ways to enable change, but this group focuses on increasing transparency in higher education; creating compassionate communities through shared vulnerability; and working collectively to shift institutional practices.

 The purpose of this paper is to examine the structure, patterns and themes of interdisciplinary collaborations in the digital humanities (DH) research through the application of social network analysis and visualization tools. The sample includes articles containing DH research in the Web of Science Core Collection as of December 2018. First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among disciplinary were extracted from the subject category. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators and interdisciplinary communities were calculated. Third, the research topics of different interdisciplinary collaboration communities based on system keywords, author keywords, title and abstracts were detected. The findings reveal that while the scope of disciplines involved in DH research is broad and evolving over time, most interdisciplinary collaborations are concentrated among several disciplines, including computer science, library and information science, linguistics and literature. The study further uncovers some communities based on closely collaborating disciplines and the evolving nature of such interdisciplinary collaboration communities over time. To better understand the close collaboration ties, the study traces and analyzes the research topics and themes of the interdisciplinary communities. Finally, the implications of the findings for DH research are discussed. This study applied various informetric methods and tools to reveal the collaboration structure, patterns and themes among disciplinaries in DH research.

My application to the Office of Digital Humanities wasn’t funded, what’s next?  | The National Endowment for the Humanities;Alert for Individual Applicants: Grants.gov & Deadline Extensions After several months of waiting for that email notification, you learn that the NEH did not select your application for funding. You are extremely disappointed and wonder if you should apply again, and if so, how to go about revising and resubmitting.   For every round of grant announcements, there are far more rejected applicants than awardees, so remember you are not alone. In fact, you are in very good company. The funding ratio for the Digital Humanities Advancement Grants (DHAGs) announced in December 2020 was at 10%.   When reading the big list of new NEH awardees, what you can’t see is that many of those individuals and project teams did not receive a grant on their first try. Indeed, 38% of December 2020’s DHAG awardees had received rejections from the NEH in the past year.   Below are a few tips for moving forward after receiving a rejection from the ODH, intended to help you rethink your application and project design for another round.   Soon after you receive your notification email, request anonymized peer review evaluations by emailing the Office of Digital Humanities (@email).   Please note, we are a small office and so this process can take a few weeks because of the volume of requests. And don’t forget to include your application number in your email!  Evaluations of grants submitted to the ODH typically reflect feedback from 3-5 experts in digital humanities, representing a wide spectrum of the field. Reviewers read 10-20 applications individually, meet virtually to discuss the applications with program staff, and then finalize their evaluations. The feedback you receive will reflect this long and careful process.  Review the comments when you are really ready to receive them. This may mean reading them quickly once they arrive in your inbox, feeling annoyed, and then returning to them the next day when you’re ready to read them alongside the application you submitted.   Ask yourself: Have your evaluators identified some issues that you had not considered? Was there something about your project that reviewers did not understand? Were you unclear in sections where you now could add more detail to help the evaluators? Did you address all of required elements of the application? Was your budget reasonable for the activities proposed? Did reviewers recommend that you investigate a different NEH grant program?   Spend some time analyzing and reviewing comments and the ratings, much like you would after receiving readers’ reports on an article or manuscript. Note where reviewers are consistent in their praise, meaning there is less work in certain areas, and focus on where they are consistent in their critiques.   Peer reviewers, however, do not always agree on strengths and weaknesses of applications. Highlight those places of disagreement for discussion with your colleagues, and perhaps with ODH program staff.    Ask yourself some difficult questions: Are you prepared to spend multiple weeks/months revising this application in pursuit of this funding opportunity? Might there be smaller or less competitive sources of funding to pursue for your project or to test out your ideas?   Sometimes the revisions required to turn your project into a competitive application will not serve your bigger goals. On the other hand, sometimes a rejected application only needs a few minor edits to become fundable. It's always worth taking the time to make sure that a revision is a good course of action.  If you are unsure whether to re-apply, or how best to incorporate reviewer feedback into a new application, contact the ODH. One of our program staff members will be able to review the comments with you and help to identify areas that might need the most attention in revising the application or in the project design. Please remember that staff’s comments are not part of the formal review process and have no bearing on its final outcome.  If appropriate, ODH staff may also direct you to another grant program at the NEH that might be a better fit to fund your digital project. (Read this blog post we have created to help direct applications to the right NEH grant program for funding digital projects.)   When you revise an unfunded application and resubmit it for a new deadline, it will be reviewed by a completely new set of peer reviewers who will not know that you submitted in the past.   You do not need to state that your application is a resubmission. The peer reviewers will not have access to your prior application or reviews.  It is a fresh start, and we encourage all applicants to make use of the materials available for writing strong applications:  Read the updated Notice of Funding Opportunity carefully as requirements change from year to year.  Read sample applications available on the grant program’s page (for example, the Institutes for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities program)  Watch a program webinar, if available (for example, for the Digital Humanities Advancement Grants program).  Find and read blog posts written by ODH on preparing strong applications.   Submit a draft before the program’s deadline (check program pages and NOFO for dates).  We hope these tips will encourage you to consider all options available to you after learning that your ODH application was not funded.  And if you are ready to discuss your options with the ODH, please get in touch about the possibility of revising and resubmitting your application.   Scam Advisory: Recent reports indicate that individuals are posing as the NEH on email and social media.

Programming for Humanists at TAMU;Programming4Humanists provides courses designed to introduce participants to methodologies, coding, and programming languages associated with the Digital Humanities. We focus on creation, editing, and searchability of digital archives, but also introduce students to data mining and statistical analysis.   Our forte at Texas A&M University (TAMU) is Optical Character Recognition of early modern texts, a skill we learned in completing the Early Modern OCR Project, or eMOP. Another strength that the Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) (http://codhr.tamu.edu) at TAMU brings to this set of courses is the Texas A&M University Press book series called Coding for Humanists. We use draft and final versions of these books, as well as many additional resources available on companion web pages, for participants in the workshop. The books in this series are of course upon publication available to anyone, along with the companion sites, whether the person has participated in the workshop or not. However, joining the Programming4Humanists (P4H) course enables participants to communicate with the authors of these books for the sake of asking questions and indeed, through their questioning, helping us to improve the books and web materials. Our goal is to help people learn Digital Humanities methods and techniques. Those who should attend include faculty, staff, librarians, undergraduates, and graduate students, anyone interested in acquiring skills for work in digital humanities and cultural analytics. Generally, the Fall semester of P4H is for anyone interested in making archival and cultural materials available to a wide audience while encoding them digitally according to best practices, standards that will allow them to submit their digital editions for peer review by organizations such as the MLA Committee for Scholarly Edition and NINES / 18thConnect. Participants will learn to code documents and manipulate them. The Spring semester is more advanced, presenting methods for data mining. Participants will learn a programming language in order to perform textual analysis on largely unstructured documents.

Inspired by her unit on indexing, as well as by the ideas explored in three other key texts – Lewis Carroll’s An Index to ‘In Memoriam’ (1862), Stephen Ramsay’s call for play in “The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around,” and Ronald Day’s comparison of indexing to “surface reading” in Indexing It All – students in ENG 398: Digital Victorians did two things. First, they created an index for Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “Sonnets from the Portuguese” (1850). Second, they wrote a brief essay assessing the implications of using indexes versus digital tools to “sort” and comprehend a literary work. Although we worked with a set of poems, this assignment can easily be adapted to a novel, set of novels, or a collection of short stories (i.e., the Sherlock Holmes stories or Kipling’s Plain Tales from the Hills). In addition to having students comprehend the purpose and (brief) history of the index, the learning objectives of this assignment were three-fold: To make this assignment engaging and comprehensible, we broke it into discrete steps that took place over four class meetings. Class Meetings 1 & 2:  In preparation for these class periods, students skimmed Lewis Carroll’s index and looked over excerpts from Henry Wheatley’s What is an Index? (1878) and How to Make an Index (1902). They also read the guidelines for creating an index from University of Georgia Press as well as Day’s “Indexing It All.” After discussing how, why, and when an index might be useful, students were asked to read “Sonnets from the Portuguese” with an eye to creating an index. Students discussed the relationships among concepts and words and how an index differed from a “key words” list. By discussing the purpose and methods of indexing, students came to appreciate why word searches and tools for text visualization alone could not generate an effective index (e.g., Voyant, Wordle, or Lexos). Class Meeting 3:  For homework, students created seven index entries and a rationale for their entries. These were posted on the course blog. In class, we shared entries and rationales. Interestingly, this opened onto a larger conversation about subentries and cross-references, and how such organizational categories reflected and inflected how we understood “Sonnets from the Portuguese.” As a class, then, we used Google Docs to compile our individual entries into a single index. We spent 50 minutes doing this. While students were working on adding and refining the index on their laptops, we had a discussion on what the index should look like (i.e., formatting, font, etc.) and how the index might serve a reader. Class Meeting 4: For the final class period, students did a close reading of select sonnets in order to see how “reading indexically” differed from “close reading.” We also broadened our conversation to talk about how these practices of reading intersected with or departed from reading practices we had explored earlier in the semester, including surface reading and distant reading.   Students thus were equipped to write a 1000-1500 word essay about their experiences. Their essays responded to some of the following questions:   This assignment yielded a number of interesting insights into “Sonnets from the Portuguese,” as well as into indexing, digital tools, and practices of reading. Moreover, the final essays generally were thoughtful, creative, and full of fascinating associations and connections. Students found this assignment to be an easy way to explore issues related to information, organizational systems, and reading practices – issues that are also, yet differently, explored in the digital humanities. I lay out the structure of this assignment in the hope that others can adapt it to examine a novel, set of novels, or short stories.    Winter Jade Werner, Wheaton College More information about text formats University of North Texas

DH in Korea: The Digital Humanities Lab at the Academy of Korean Studies – The Digital Orientalist;"The Digital Orientalist Practical examples and theoretical reflections on the do's and don'ts of using digital tools for your study and research in African and Asian Studies. In a previous post I briefly presented some of the richest and most commonly used online resources for Korean Studies. There I suggested that despite the plethora of premodern textual material that is freely available online, it remained to be seen what kind of digital humanities work scholars of Korea would be able to produce. Many factors contribute to this lukewarm reception on the peninsula itself, but chief among them is the sentiment among scholars that the barrier to entry is too high. The time investment required to learn how to generate meaningful research using computer-assisted analysis is too great in the publish-or-perish world of Korean academia. This is a reality that many of us in the West understand all too well. However, a younger group of scholars more at ease with digital interfaces and forward-thinking established faculty with graduate student assistants, are producing notable DH projects and making incremental progress towards establishing an ecosystem that encourages the consumption of historical facts and digitized archival data by scholars, students, and the general public. In this post I will introduce the Digital Humanities Laboratory initiative at the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS) as a case study of the use of the wiki platform to create and publish premodern content. The initiative is comprised of seven groups that are responsible for different aspects of the DH Lab’s overarching goal which is to “encourage the innovative reproduction of human knowledge in creative ways in the digital environment.” Based on the concept of the wiki platform, each group has its own wiki site with linked and nested pages that provide more information about a project or a piece of cultural heritage. These are linked, most with English titles, at the top of the bare bones landing page. Of these, the “Jangseogak Wiki” is worth noting because the results of some of the annual academic workshops and training programs held at the Changsŏgak Archives are published here as collaborative wiki content.   For instance, the 2016 Hanmun workshop’s translations from literary Chinese to English of selected documents from the Chosŏn (also transliterated as Joseon) Dynasty are available as English language wiki pages along with the original text, images of the original documents, and references for further research. This type of translation work, although extremely beneficial to scholars and fields of study as a whole, is very often eschewed by scholars because they are time consuming and because the evaluative systems for tenure in academia do not value translation as worthy scholarly output. Publishing translations generated collaboratively in training workshops as wiki content, though it does not adequately address all the issues mentioned above, may be a model that other fields of study might want to iterate on to address this issue. Another interesting cluster in the AKS DH Lab is the “Encyves.” This is a neologism that blends the concepts of the encyclopedia and the archives together. As opposed to traditional encyclopedias, the contents of the Encyves are structured as nodes of a network, where each entry is linked to related entries through relationship tags displayed as a network visualization graph (an example is the featured image at the top of this post) and table at the bottom of the page. These visualizations help users see macro-level patterns in the historical documents more readily than text and encourage exploration of the Encyves‘s other entries. Further multi-media offerings like video content, 3D animations, and VR of sites and objects add to the discovery of the subject of an entry in various formats. A VR pavilion of historical buildings, objects, and past museum exhibitions gives users from all over the world access to an immersive experience of being on site. As well as the augmented reality capabilities of being able to  on icons in the simulation.  VR simulation of the Hoeam-sa temple site in Yangju, Kyŏnggi province, South Korea. Users can move through the site by ing on labeled guide circles on the screen.   Some of these entries have been grouped into general themes, such as “monk stupa stele inscriptions” that lists all actors, places, objects, and texts that are related to monk stupa stele inscription entries in the Encyves. These types of groupings point to the wealth of content on this site and provide an alternative structure to the alphabetical listing that traditional encyclopedias would employ to organize knowledge. This, however, obviates the ways in which the DH Lab privileges specific types of cultural history and relationships. It is truly to the DH Lab team’s credit that they have been able to organize and present such a staggering amount of premodern material in a digital format. Self-identified as a work in progress, there are several areas that could still benefit from further development. Beyond the numerous broken links and empty wiki pages, the Encyves do a poor job of combining the archive with encyclopedia. For example, it is surprising that the entry for the Mogŭnjip 牧隱集, a collection of poems written by the late Koryŏ scholar Yi Saek, does not include or directly link to the freely available text. Another aspect of the Encyves project that should be reconsidered is the presentation of digital media, such as 3D imaging and VR, as appropriate parts of an archive. Though these models are based on photography and 3D imaging software, they are nevertheless recreations of an object or place hundreds of years later than the date presented in an Encyves entry. The current format offers engagement with objects and places as holistically as possible, but this is often times at odds with the incomplete actuality of the thing or site itself. This is an important issue for cultural heritage preservation, archaeology, and art history that I will address in a subsequent post about digital images and remote research.   On a practical note, this portal is a great tool for students who are interested in learning about Korean History. The DH Lab even has an entire department that features English language wikis on Korean Studies topics called Korea 100. For those who are teaching in an online format this coming semester, these wikis are accessible and helpful assignments especially since they touch upon some underrepresented topics and can contribute to diversifying your syllabi. Ultimately this initiative, though insufficient in many ways, models many of the ideals digital humanities projects aspire to: collaboration, dynamic and multi-faceted use, iterability. It also offers an alternative to the current incommensurability between an academic publishing system that still has yet to figure out an acceptable way to deal with born-digital or digital-reliant humanistic scholarship. The AKS DH Lab provides a prototype for other fields to build upon and showcases the potential of the wiki platform in the digital dissemination and creation of scholarly and public-facing historical content.

One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr. Roberto Busa in His Own Words | Data, Culture & Society;" Close Jointly hosted by the Centre for Data, Culture & Society and UCL DH, this event features contributors to the new volume One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa S.J. in His Own Words edited by Julianne Nyhan and Marco Passarotti (Springer 2020). Roberto Busa S.J. is often described as one of the founders of the field now known as Digital Humanities, but many of his writings are difficult to access. One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa S.J. in His Own Words draws on extensive archival research to select and contextualise previously out of print or inaccessible writings of Busa, translated into English for the first time. Each article is paired with a new introduction; in addition, a substantial new chapter analyses Busa’s intellectual legacy for Digital Humanities methodology. A complete bibliography of Busa (1949-2009), and an oral history interview with Busa’s translator (Philip Barras), is also included. This authoritative collection makes available, for the first time, fundamental primary and secondary sources that are crucial for the writing of histories of the Digital Humanities. The book moreover presents a deeper, more complex account of the data-led work of Busa, whose work is highly-cited yet little critiqued, and thus a new insight into the data-foundations of the (Digital) Humanities. This seminar features discussions from contributors and is chaired by CDCS Director Professor Melissa Terras. 1. Melissa Terras (University of Edinburgh): Introduction 2. Julianne Nyhan (UCL) and Marco Passarotti (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore): ""Reflections on the production of One Origin of Digital Humanities: Fr Roberto Busa in his own words."" 3. Geoffrey Rockwell (University of Alberta): ""Knowing through algorithms: How exactly did Busa and Tasman process words with calculating machines?"" In this paper Geoffrey Rockwell will look at different descriptions of the innovative process developed for concerning by Busa and Tasmin. This will lead to reflections on how Father Busa, a philosopher, thought computing could model knowing. 4. Steve Jones (University of South Florida): ""Where Was CAAL?"" In 1956, Roberto Busa, S.J., founded CAAL, the Centro per L'Automazione dell'Analisi Letteraria. After several years in temporary locations, in 1961 CAAL settled in a former textile factory outside Milan. What is the significance of that physical plant and location when it came to the institutional realities of CAAL and its work?   First broadcast on 20 January 2021.

New Department “Digital Humanities and Social Studies“ › Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology;"New Department “Digital Humanities and Social Studies“ As part of the High-Tech Agenda Bavaria, the new Department of Digital Humanities and Social Studies (DHSS) started its work on 1 January 2021. The new department is dedicated to the research challenge of translating cultural and social worlds into data and formal models and interpreting the computer-assisted analysis to draw conclusions for our lives in society. The department at a glance: New HTA professorships: The new department is keen to promote strong interdisciplinary connections and targeted collaboration with selected central institutions at FAU. As a university which offers the entire spectrum of academic disciplines, FAU offers the perfect framework for interdisciplinary collaboration, a clear advantage when it comes to establishing digital humanities as a key research priority. The transdisciplinary nature of the new professorships will allow established subjects in the area of humanities at FAU to benefit from increased digital expertise. Since 2016, a degree programme in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences has been offered at Bachelor’s and Master’s level. The HTA at FAU The new department (short DHSS) is mirrored by the new department for Data Science (DDS) at the faculty of natural sciences, which will include five professorships and focus on base research on the mathematics of data science and statistics. The concepts for both departments were selected from a range of internal concept proposals and were evaluated and recommended by the Executive Board, the deans and external review panels. Established professorships and institutions of other faculties and departments will be cooperating with the new departments, for example by means of primary or secondary membership, supporting a maximum of interdisciplinary work. Both departments forego conventional chair structures and are thus piloting innovative concepts for the structural development of FAU. ‘I am very proud of the way our universities are seizing the opportunities the High-Tech Agenda Bavaria and the acceleration programme High-Tech Agenda Plus offer for widening the scope of their research. FAU is a shining example of how new, additional professorships can collaborate with existing ones,’ says Bavarian minister of science Bernd Sibler. ‘The future is built on ideas, visions and expertise. That is clearly reflected in FAU’s concept. Interdisciplinarity has always been a feature of FAU. Bringing researchers together in these new structures, however, will move the collaboration which has until now been more on a case by case basis into a whole new dimension.’ ‘By establishing these two new departments, we are powering ahead with the next stage of the High-Tech Agenda at FAU at the same time as driving forward our own university strategy for the future #FAU2025,’ explains FAU President Prof. Dr. Joachim Hornegger. ‘The professorships included in the new departments will also perfectly complement the research of their colleagues in the newly established Department of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering. I am particularly pleased about the huge potential benefits for our students. The degree programmes Data Science and Digital Humanities & Social Sciences will profit from an even greater level of subject expertise and a wider range of topics.’

UK-Ireland collaboration in digital humanities – UKRI;"Last updated: 12 April 2021                     Apply for funding for digital humanities research. Your project must be large, innovative and multidisciplinary. UK and Ireland-based researchers must collaborate on the project. The themes are: AHRC will provide up to £320,000 per project for UK costs, at 80% of the full economic cost. The Irish Research Council (IRC) will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%). Your project must start on 1 August 2021 and last for up to 36 months. Standard eligibility criteria (please see section two of AHRC’s research funding guide) will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK principal investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the principal investigator and any co-investigators to devote an average of at least four hours per week to the project. The UK component must fall within the remit of AHRC. Inter-disciplinary proposals are welcome but the majority of the methodologies, research questions and outputs must fall within AHRC’s subject remit. Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a project partner letter of support. Guidance on what needs to be included in a project partner letter of support is provided on page 71 of the AHRC research funding guide. Co-investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s international co-investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the case for support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration. Please refer to the AHRC research funding guide for further information on AHRC’s international co-investigator policy and which costs are eligible within a UK budget. The Irish principal investigator and co-investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the IRC’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the digital humanities field. Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date. In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the IRC before the award’s commencement. There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified. Please note that attendance at the programme’s UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Networking Workshop (October 2019), and/or engagement with its Research Networking Call, is not a pre-condition of application to this call. Specifically, the call aims to support a diverse range of projects that: The projects should take innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to explore the broad and inclusive themes: AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project. The IRC will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%).  Each award must start by 1 August 2021 and should have a duration of up to 36 months. The principal investigator in the UK will be responsible for submitting a joint UK-Ireland proposal through the research council’s Joint Electronic Submission system (Je-S). Applications should be submitted through the Je-S system by 18 March 2021 16:00, and will need to go through the appropriate institution submission process prior to this. To prepare a proposal form in Je-S: Je-S will then create a proposal form, displaying the relevant section headings. Using the blue question marks and the ‘Help’ link at the top of each section will provide guidance relevant to that section of the form. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one principal investigator to be included in a proposal. For this AHRC-IRC call, there is to be one principal investigator from the UK and one from Ireland. On the Je-S form the principal investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a co-investigator. Such terminology must be considered as a built-in system feature, and does not challenge the equal status and co-leadership of the UK and Irish PI. All investigators named on the Je-S application form, whether based in the UK or Ireland, must have a Je-S account. Where a named investigator does not already have a Je-S account, one can be easily set up, but please note that the process can take a number of days. It is therefore strongly recommended that the process is started well before the application deadline. Following the deadline for submission, all proposals will be checked for eligibility. After the deadline for submissions, PIs will be informed of any outstanding return for amendment requirements. Five working days will be given for the return for amendment process. More information about this process will be provided at the relevant stage of the call. Eligible proposals will be reviewed by AHRC and IRC nominated reviewers and there will a principal investigator response stage in April/May 2021. The PI response should be submitted by the UK principal investigator in consultation with the Irish principal investigator. A joint moderating panel will take place in early June where the eligible proposals will be graded and ranked. The panel will be comprised of members of the AHRC’s Peer Review College and academic reviewers nominated by the IRC. The panel will moderate the reviewers’ scores for each proposal, agree a ranked priority list of applications and make funding recommendations to the AHRC and the IRC. The panel will be asked to be consider the following criteria when making recommendations to the AHRC and IRC for funding. Excellence and vision: People, partnerships and management: Data management: Value for money: Outputs, dissemination, impact and sustainability: It is expected that 4 to 6 awards will be made under this call, with the aim of having a balanced portfolio of awards across the thematic areas, (subject to proposals meeting the criteria and quality standards detailed above). Outcomes will be issued in early July 2021. Enquiries: fic@ahrc.ukri.org Dr Jamie Davies, International Partnerships and Engagement Manager Enquiries: digital.humanities@research.ie Dr Chiara Loda, Programme Manager Brenda Blake, Research Support Officer The Research Grants Call is part of a collaborative funding programme between the AHRC and the IRC which aims to deliver a transformational impact on digital humanities research in the UK and Ireland. The programme will exploit complementary strengths in the digital humanities in the UK and Ireland, leading to new partnerships and cross-disciplinary projects, building capacity and enhancing the integration of humanities and technology in digital humanities development. It builds on the ‘UK-Ireland Collaboration in the Digital Humanities’ scoping workshop that took place in Dublin from 22 to 23 October 2019 and the UK-Ireland Collaboration in the Digital Humanities Research Networking Call. You can find answers to frequently asked questions on the IRC website (PDF, 308KB).

Heimonen_abstract | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki;"Abstract The presentation examines what insights text mining in the ECCO and other Enlightenment databases can bring to musical analysis of Mozart's piano concerto corpus. The music analytical part of research is based on a narratological model of dialogue in Mozart's concerto form developed in my dissertation that juxtaposes internal dialogue with cultural influences. Here one argues for a novel explanation of mechanism of dialogue between solo and ritornello (orchestra) sections in concerto form. The presentation is based on an existential semiotic framework that seeks resemblances of morality, passions and related concepts between Enlightenment society and narratological features in concertos. Of special importance are those concertos (KV 467, 482, 453, 456), where this interaction is the result of historical layering of discourse and the deontic forces that arise in the ensuing dialogue. The paper further enquires if this is a symptom of a broader stylistic change that rearranges baroque, classical and romantic influences within classical style paving the way to romanticism and possibly provoking parallels with the idea of a second Enlightenment. In analyzing the text corpus distributional semantics will serve the purpose of finding such occurrences that hold resemblance to moral terms and topics found in the concerto corpus. A thoroughgoing issue in the paper is how the examination of these phenomena can be supported by DH methodologies. To build up a sense of representation of an individual in society within a concerto's solo-ritornello alteration, one needs a methodology to describe an 18th century person's sociability. In terms of topics and morality one needs to be able to identify them as belonging either to individual or social spheres. A close counterpart would be private and public spheres as they were conceived in the Enlightenment. A third factor to be considered is the ancient regime with a sociability of its own. To match with the concertos an examination of individual-social -relation from Baroque to romanticism is needed because of the historical layering of concerto dialogue. The nature of interaction is subject to change in individual's reaction to changing societal norms that in the study are depicted as deontic statements in natural language. In finding co-occurring terms distributional semantics helps to find similarities and differences between moral terms and topics and to form corresponding groups of concepts. Here the role of benevolence is especially central. In the above group of four concertos the interaction is especially geared toward progressive sociability and the group serves as a corpus for a study that is more limited in scope. In a wider study of the whole concerto corpus an even broader parallel examination of stylistic and historical changes of moral and topical content becomes possible. In the process a conception of representation of culture will emerge. The latter research will also allow a stylistic re-evaluation of Mozart's concertos and the model of concerto form behind it.

A Practical Toolkit on Successful Grant Writing Skills: A Workbook for Development Professionals The AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project.
The IRC will provide up to €270,000. Each award must start by 1st August 2021 and should have duration of up to 36 months.
Eligibility Criteria Proposals must include at least one researcher from both the UK and Ireland and must have a Principal Investigator (PI) in each country. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one Principal Investigator to be included in a proposal. On the Je-S form, the Principal Investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a Co-Investigator. UK applicants:
Standard eligibility criteria will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK Principal Investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the Principal Investigator and any Co-Investigators to devote an average of at least 4 hours per week to the project.
The UK component must fall within the remit of the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a Project Partner Letter of Support.
Co-Investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s International Co-Investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the Case for Support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration.
Irish applicants:
The Irish Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the Irish Research Council’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the Digital Humanities field.
Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date.
In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the Irish Research Council before the award’s commencement.
There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified.

Historic digital humanities maps and data project | The University of Edinburgh;"Building on the success we have had in our digital humanities partnership with History , Classics and Archaeology ( HCA) in mapping the historical Scottish Witches, LTW have a new web project which has just launched Mapping the Scottish Reformation – A database of the Scottish clergy, 1560 to 1689. Mapping the Scottish Reformation – A database of the Scottish clergy, 1560 to 1689 contains data extracted from over ten thousand pages of manuscript evidence housed in the National Records of Scotland, this website offers researchers powerful new tools to trace the careers of around seven hundred Scottish clergymen and almost five hundred of their wives from Lothian and Tweeddale (the region surrounding Edinburgh) between 1560 and 1689. Each map view offers users a hitherto unavailable set of tools to refine their research questions. By showing users full manuscript references, researchers can use the website as a starting point for their research into the rich and complex archival records at the National Records of Scotland and maps provided by the National Library of Scotland and the historical maps API. The ISG staff who did the web/data work are Stewart Cromar, Hristo Meshinski and Ewan McAndrew. The project is  an international collaboration led at Edinburgh University by Professor Jane E. A. Dawson and Professor Julian Goodare.

The Digital Classroom: A Digital Humanities Primer on Tools, Methods, and Resources | American Studies Journal;"ISSN 2199-7268 This article will focus on teaching with digital humanities (DH) methods and tools as they relate to their practicability in the context of the classroom. It will concentrate on the specific challenges that the teaching of computational methods pose to educators who are experts in their discipline but might feel that they lack the technical know-how to steer their students towards DH. In particular, the article will introduce a number of tools that allow school students and educators to access digital approaches and to start appreciating their relevance for research. These include online resources for literary analysis, simple programs that may be used for research into media, and archival projects that stem from the collaboration of students and staff and bring neglected histories to an outside audience. While these tools do not demand any practical programming knowledge, I will also present resources that teach widely used coding languages such as Python and R on a step-by-step basis. The third and final part of the article will introduce a number of methods and services that empower educators to create a digital classroom with quantitative approaches and distant learning as their primary characteristics. Teaching these methods might prove challenging at first.; yet the hands-on, collaborative, quality of DH also leads to classroom situations in which students and staff become co-learners, and therefore leads to a democratizing effect.  Kahoot   Allison, Sarah, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti, Amir Tevel, and Irena Yamboliev.

UCLDH / CESTA / Uppsala Seminar Series | UCL Centre for Digital Humanities - UCL – University College London;"UCL Centre for Digital Humanities  Technology is global, but where we live affects how we apply digital solutions to humanities work. We all have what Roopika Risam described as a digital humanities (DH) “accent”. This seminar series explores those accents by looking at DH research here, and there, and over there too. This is a chance to build greater global awareness and empathy about regional and local approaches to digital humanities in the twenty-first century. It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed differently around the globe, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots. This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon our successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

"Virtual Martin Luther King, Jr. Project – A rhetorical digital humanities project of the ""Fill Up the Jails"" public speech";"The Story of the Virtual MLK Project Just days after the start of the Greensboro sit-ins In February 1960, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered what would become a widely influential speech titled, “A Creative Protest.” Despite the historical and rhetorical significance of what is commonly known as the “Fill Up the Jails” speech, no recordings exist. Here, for the first time, using advanced digital and audio technology, we provide an opportunity for scholars, students and citizens to experience and explore this important speech.

Where to Start? On Research Questions in The Digital Humanities | Trevor Owens;"How should digital humanities scholars develop research questions? Spurred on by this recent conversation on twitter, I figured I would lay out a few different ways to go about answering this question about questions. The gist of the dialog is that Jason Heppler suggested that one should “Fit the tool to the question, not the other way around” in terms of working with various kinds of new digital humanities tools. I take tools here to mean any computational instrument employed to understand the world; for examples GIS, topic modeling, creating simulations using cellular automata or agent based models, analyzing frequencies of audio files, or visualizing trends in images. I get where Jason was going, but at least as it was formulated I don’t think it is the right advice. The conversation prompted me to try and clarify a bit of how I see the relationship between research questions, primary sources, and tools and methods. Start with the Question, the Archive or the Tool? Some historians start with their question, some start with a familiarity with a period that suggests that exploration of a particular archive or collection of primary resources could answer. Here are two examples I can recall from colleagues who I worked with doing research in the history of science. One colleague was aware of the shift that had occurred between classical and modern physics in one astronomer’s work, documented in a recent essay. So he went to look at the papers of another astronomer, which had not yet been particularly well explored, to see if similar or different responses to the notion of a distinction between classical and modern physics had emerged in that astronomer’s work. In short, it was largely about abstracting the results of one exploration into the information available in another individuals archive. In either case, it’s a bit of a dance between formation of questions and the ways that those questions open up or shift and change as one gets into the complicated, rich and vast space of the possibilities of primary sources. The Function of Research Questions in History/the Humanities Back up a bit. What is the purpose of research questions in the humanities? I would posit that the purpose of them is to clarify what is in and out of scope in a project. To define where a project should start and end. Lastly, research questions provide a constant point of reference to check back on when working on a project. You write down your questions as you go, and you can always pull them out again and check to see if, in fact, you are actually working to answer them or if you have drifted off to some other problem. Research questions are useful structures to organize your work and inquiry and they are valuable tools for signifying to others what to expect from a piece of scholarship. Research question are functionally an attempt to establish the set of criteria by which a piece of scholarship should be evaluated. The Problem of Research Proposals and Fancy Writing One of the big problems in talking about research questions is that one often describes research questions and methods in research proposals (for grants or dissertations etc.), and those proposals are often really a form of what Joe Maxwell calls “fancy writing.” That is, those kinds of research proposals are more about the performance of demonstrating how smart you are and why you should be given permission to do work than they are about actually trying to get research done. If you haven’t read it, I can’t recommend Joe’s Qualitative Research Design: An Interactive Approach strongly enough. In focusing on the actual purpose of research design and not the performance of proposal writing he cuts through a bunch of the fancy stuff to get to the way that research questions actually develop and evolve. He calls it an interactive approach, but I think iterative would be just as descriptive. In Maxwell’s approach, there are five components of research design as it is actually practiced. The diagram below illustrates how 5 components of design interact Illustration of how research questions should be iteratively defined and developed in relation to goals, conceptual framework, methods, and validity threats. From Maxwell 2014 The main point of the diagram, is that your research questions should be iteratively revised and refined throughout the work based on all the four other things that you are working on. So… research questions aren’t something you state and then follow through on, they are best thought of as statements about your inquiry that are iteratively refined through the process of defining what you are working on. Generally, the way that research questions are stated in quantitative research is bogus, or at least, bogus in terms of the way that people who do more qualitative research think of research questions. That is, you do a lot of work and scholarship before you can ever formulate a hypothesis that you can test. In that case, you end up with a research question at the end of an exploration not at the front of it. Tools, Archives, & Research Questions are Inherently Theory Laden  Getting back to the issue of questions, tools, and sources; being good humanists, it is worth leaning back to grok that all method is theory laden. That is, every attempt to answer a question comes with inherent theoretical assumptions about the problem and limitations in what that method can provide in terms of answers. This is true of method broadly conceived; every method for collecting sources/evidence, the original intent by which records and sources are collected create silences, identifying a problem, interpreting sources, composing and reporting on results, all of that, comes with some inherent biases. That is, all tools, all archives and all research questions are in and of themselves instrumental. We use them in an attempt to understand the world. That is they all serve as lens like tools reflecting and refracting back information in a tool like fashion. I’ve always liked the way that Umberto Eco explains this in Kant and the Platypus as a core concept in hermeneutics; we make interpretations but the underlying reality of existence exerts the force to resist some of those interpretations by simply saying “No” by making it clear that an interpretation can be refuted. A hermeneutics of data that emerges through the use of tools. So where to start? Start wherever, as long as where you start is anchored in your goals. The hermeneutics of screwing around is itself invaluable. A technique of messing with tools and datasets at hand may well surface interesting patterns that no one would have found if they were working at sources in a another fashion. Pick and archive and find the questions. Or, just start with your questions and work it that way. Whatever you do, realize that it’s an exploratory process. What matters most in where you start is your actual goals in doing the research. That is, why is it that you are actually doing your work? What is it that you hope your work will potentially do. Don’t confuse your goals with what you are interested in, realize and recognize that your goals area about the purpose of your work. If you want to do work that ultimately helps to understand and give voice to the voiceless then you likely don’t want to start messing around with the text of inaugural presidential speeches. If you want to figure out new kinds of things that can be done with topic modeling then you would presumably want to start with some sources that are in a form or close to a form that you can topic model. Thanks to Thomas Padilla and Zach Coble who reviewed and provided input on a draft of this post.    I’m glad to see that questions of research are being addressed here in relation to digital tools. I think these are often overlooked in digital projects. I don’t know how many presentations I’ve been to where someone shows off a new tool, or a new database, without a clear sense of what kinds of questions would be made available that weren’t available before. It’s not enough to say that, now that we have a new tool or database, people can ask whatever they want. That doesn’t mean that everything must be worked out in advance – far from it. The questions become clear as you immerse yourself in the area.  It seems to me that questions are the coin of the realm in research. In my own area of philosophy, we’ve often thought of our atomic structure (that is, the irreducible building blocks) as being claims. I’m not sure that’s true. I think it’s well-asked questions. This may be why there are relatively fewer philosophers doing digital humanities projects than there are other disciplines – philosophers have yet to be convinced as to the value of the digital for asking new philosophical questions. I think they often just don’t give it a chance, and don’t explore much, but the issue remains – each discipline has a set of questions that it recognizes as its own, and some have done a better job of figuring out how digital tools and environments can help to refine/change/advance those questions than others.

Digital humanities in the K-12 classroom - NEO BLOG;In my previous post we explored the origins and definitions of digital humanities and covered a few examples of how the techniques are being applied in higher education. Today, I’d like to look at ways the K-12 teacher can utilize some of the very exciting techniques and tools of digital humanities in their classrooms. The suggestion when it comes to dabbling in DH (Digital Humanities) in the classroom is to take an exploratory, curious and light approach. Don’t try to tackle all of the concepts and techniques in one go, but rather allow your students to “play” with the tools. In that vein I will list a few tools and inspiring projects as a soft guide to your class’s DH journey. Enjoy, and don’t forget to let me know your DH thoughts and experiences in the comments. StoryMap is a tool developed by Knight Labs of North Western University. In true DH-style, it brings designers, developers and journalists together to develop tools that bring stories to life. The software allows users to plot out events across a geography — it gives visual aides to any narrative, be it fictional, historical or personal. From a Digital Humanities point of view, it uses technology to further visualize data, that then enhances both one’s ability to comprehend the narrative, as well as share it. Another useful part of the tool is that students can build the story maps together. (Ever struggled to follow Arya’s (rather complicated) journey through the Game of Thrones? Wonder no longer as there’s a Story Map for that!) Of course applications such as these are probably too technical for younger students, however story maps remain an important tool assisting younger students to “map” out storylines, characters and places in a story. There are a number of analogue printables aides online that will help elementary school teachers bring a new dimension to story-time. Story maps have also been shown to assist comprehension in other areas such as math (where students use the aide to break-down the problem into smaller pieces), social studies and science (where the narrative of an experiment is broken down into its composite pieces and actors). Google also has great story mapping software, called My Maps. Students can collaborate using the software to create both historical and contemporary maps, adding layers that could include images, links, videos, graphics and small descriptions. Naturally because it uses “real” maps it is not necessarily adaptable to fictional environments — for that the Story Maps app is more flexible. Some teachers have found useful ways to include My Maps as a station in their blended learning classrooms, where each student contributes to one map as they cycle through the stations. Read more: 4 Models of blended learning to implement in the classroom N-what? An N-gram is a “word unit”, so it could either be a phrase, a word or only part of a word, such as the “i” in iPod, iMac etc. Ngrams are used by linguists to chart or map word and phrase usage within specific texts, as well as across whole swathes of literature. The frequency of ngrams can tell scholars a lot about the emergence of trends within society, the spread of knowledge, and indeed even the emergence of bias, fake news and beliefs. Now the fun part. Google has developed an Ngram Viewer that searches for whichever ngram you input, across all of the books the search engine has scanned, currently standing at about 25 million of what Google estimates to be 130 million total books. Books scanned so far include publications from between 1500 – 2000 and include English, Chinese (simplified), French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. At first the Ngram Viewer may appear dull to the average student — it’s literally a line graph, but once you start playing around with it, it becomes increasingly engaging. For instance my name, Susannah, enjoyed a highpoint of popularity in 1904. For other fun examples of how ngrams can reveal trends, usage and indeed history itself perhaps start with the Ngram info page. The varieties of graphs that can be produced by the viewer can, in fact, be overwhelming. Once again, perhaps explore it alongside your students using the following ideas as a jumping off point: GapMinder is an epic non-profit data-based project that moves from the basic premise that nobody really knows the real facts about the world. Founded on typical DH values such as open-source software, social awareness, collaborative data collection and tool development the foundation has, in the last 15 years, developed a wonderful array of data visualization tools that give true insight into how other people live, bringing vast data sets to life with relevance and a timely sense of urgency. Read more: A call for more visual learning elements in schools For starters their GapMinder Tools allow users to find maps and charts demonstrating statistics from around the world across a wide variety of subsets. Ever wondered how Math achievement among fourth graders has changed across the world between 1997 and 2013? Looking for an animation showing how aid per capita has increased the median life expectancy in the world? These tools will find that chart, delivering an animated starting point for fact-based, yet engaging lessons on anything from healthcare and infrastructure, to unemployment and education. A second inspired project from GapMinder is what they call Dollar Street. Dollar Street is a visualization of the globe’s socio-economic profile, as if each country was a household on a single street. Using community captured data, and real stories, from real families, this tool and data-base has a wealth of accurate information that will give your students a real world-view of how other people live. A good place to start with Gapminder is their Teacher page. Digital Humanities is delivering incredible tools and techniques to help students understand their world a bit better, and in the process deepening their understanding of society, history, language and culture. The tools are typically easy to use, and can be adapted across grades and subjects — a true blend of technology and pedagogy delivering platforms for real insight as well as demystifying how data can reveal true knowledge. Susannah has years of writing experience. She would have liked to be forever a student, but life had other things in mind. So NEO is the perfect place for her to address topics about e-learning and ed-tech for schools. We’ll keep you updated with the most valuable E-learning tips and resources.

Please join us March 15-17, 2021 for our three-day conference. This year's theme is about exploring the lure or repulsion of uncertainty, pain, and unease in technology, communication and the academy. Presenters will be able to showcase projects that impart the ways in which society avoids sitting in discomfort and uncertainty and ways that discomfort is used to further ideologies, impart understanding, and even create art. Our call for proposals has now closed. Registration for the conference is now closed. To view previous conference programs, go here.;https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/dihucon2021/home;
Turning the Page;Emory’s leadership in digital publishing and open access expands the scope and reach of new humanities scholarship By Senta Scarborough | Jan. 14, 2021 A groundbreaking effort within Emory College of Arts and Sciences brings books by humanities faculty to wider audiences through open access publication, making the works freely available online to anyone in the world with internet access. Supported by Emory’s Digital Publishing in the Humanities initiative, university presses have published seven open access scholarly books, or monographs, by Emory faculty since 2018. Four more are forthcoming by 2022. “This initiative increases the impact of scholarship in the humanities — and allows our faculty to cultivate new audiences for their research — while also positioning Emory as a leader in the creative expansion of open access digital publishing,” says Emory College Dean Michael A. Elliott, who is the principal investigator for the $1.2 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that funds the digital publishing initiative.  The scope in scholarship spans the subjects of molecular feminism, early Soviet Union architecture, Korean letter writing, standup feminist comedy, segregated Jim Crow era psychiatric hospitals, race and food origins in the early United States, and others.   “What drives me and most faculty is the dissemination of our research and discoveries. This (open access) is going to reach a bigger audience than if you required it to be purchased,” says Jacob Wright, associate professor of Hebrew Bible in Emory’s Candler School of Theology. Within days of publication this summer, Wright’s newest book had thousands of online views. “War, Memory, and National Identity in the Hebrew Bible” (published several months ago with Cambridge University Press) has a global market, making open access optimal for students and scholars. It’s particularly important for Wright’s international Coursera students. “For a student, say, in Bangladesh to buy a book on a Bible causes political problems. Students all across the world can go online privately without having to order something and be watched for what they are reading. And it’s free,” says Wright.  Jacob Wright, associate professor, Candler School of Theology Jacob Wright, associate professor, Candler School of Theology   Elizabeth Wilson, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Elizabeth Wilson, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Another scholarly benefit is open access simply makes research easier, says Elizabeth Wilson, a Samuel Candler Dobbs professor and director of undergraduate studies in the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies department. “In doing research, I can pull up a book and, in a minute, find the quote I am searching after. The searchability function is really important. I don’t have to plow through a book looking for these things,” says Wilson. Her book, “A Silvan Tomkins Handbook: Foundations for Affect Theory” (University of Minnesota Press), published in August, not only has academic appeal but is a useful guide for psychologists and clinics.    Lauren Klein, associate professor, Department of English and Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods Lauren Klein, associate professor, Department of English and Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods  Monographs are often written for scholars in a particular field, and engage in field-specific conversation. That specificity narrows the audience, but not the relevancy to other disciplines, says Lauren Klein, director of Emory’s Digital Humanities Lab and an associate professor of English and quantitative theory and methods. “An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States” (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) is her monograph digitally published in May. These books are part of Emory’s commitment to open access through TOME, Toward an Open Monograph Ecosystem, where universities pledge to subsidize digital publication. “The TOME project is geared towards these scholarly books that are the gold standard in humanities disciplines, and because of that — the institutional and disciplinary pressures — it’s hard to get a broader audience without external mechanisms like funding,” Klein says.   Unlike its academic counterpart, the sciences, the humanities are new to the world of open access publishing. Cynthia Willett, a Samuel Candler Dobbs professor of philosophy, didn’t publish digitally until 2019 with her fifth book, “Uproarious: How Feminists and Other Subversive Comics Speak Truth” (University of Minnesota Press). She’s heard from stand-up comics who she doubts would have discovered the book if only printed.  “It broadened the scope of the idea of who the audience would be and that was exciting,” Willett says. “It challenged us and we expanded it.” Monographs are expensive to publish and purchase. Open access publication allows academics and non-academics to give the material a chance.   Cynthia Willett, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy Cynthia Willett, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy    Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty and professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty and professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies   Deboleena Roy, senior associate dean of faculty for ECAS and professor of neuroscience and behavioral biology and women’s, gender and sexuality studies, never imagined her book, “Molecular Feminisms: Biology, Becomings, and Life in the Lab” (University of Washington Press, 2018) would be read by artists and architects or be taught interactively with students in Australia. She’s also had an increase in global speaking engagements from Romania to Singapore. “I think open access has had an impact. The international attention to the work is more than I had anticipated,” Roy says. Wright says people need to understand that knowledge isn’t free. Even open access books are expensive to produce.  Costs include the years scholars spend researching and writing, the price of university presses publishing the book, and the “invisible” university expenditures in editorial and technical support.  The Digital Publishing in the Humanities initiative is based in Emory College’s Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry. Collaborators include the Scholarly Communications Office of Emory Libraries, the Center for Faculty Development and Excellence (CFDE) and the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. Together, they create an infrastructure that supports faculty developing digital monographs.  For example, Lisa Macklin, associate dean of research, engagement and scholarly communications in the Emory Libraries, helps authors navigate copyright challenges with university presses, crafting book contracts to meet open access requirements.   Hwisang Cho, assistant professor, Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures  Hwisang Cho, assistant professor, Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures The CFDE provides workshops on public scholarship, funds for developmental editing, and writing groups. Korean studies assistant professor Hwisang Cho received a grant from its Scholarly Writing and Publishing (SWAP) fund for his book, “The Power of the Brush: Epistolary Practices in Chosŏn Korea,” which was published open access in October by the University of Washington Press.  Emory’s project began in 2014 as a faculty working group searching for new models in humanities publishing led by Elliott while he was serving as executive associate dean for Emory College.  In 2016, Emory received a $1.2 million Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant. Under Elliott’s direction, the grant helps university presses offset open access publishing costs while fostering new opportunities for faculty to experiment with digital publishing. Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship “It’s not unusual in the sciences to come to the university with a lab package, but the humanities haven’t had that opportunity,” says Allen Tullos, co-director of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. “The Mellon grant was encouraging universities to offer subsidies to presses to publish monographs online and demonstrate every university should support its faculty in this way.” So far, Tullos says the grant has “been a success” with scholars increasingly opting for online publishing. Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing Sarah McKee, senior associate director for publishing, helms the initiative, supporting individual projects and keeping the humanities community informed. “The open access and digital publications landscape is continually evolving, so our hope is to include everyone in the conversation — even those who are not actively working on a digital monograph,” McKee says. The initiative offers workshops and lectures to help spread the word. This fall, the annual Open Access Authors Reception was a virtual celebration, with a new website built to showcase open access works from across the university.   Kylie Smith, Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor of nursing Kylie Smith, Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor of nursing “Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South” won’t be published by the University of North Carolina Press both in print and online for two years. The author, Kylie Smith, an Andrew W. Mellon Faculty Fellow for Nursing and Humanities and associate professor at Emory, didn’t want her book to remain on a shelf. Like other digital book authors supported by Emory, Smith is writing the book traditionally — not posting the book until it is peer reviewed and published. But Smith enters new digital terrain: as she writes and researches, anyone can follow her process online.  She uses the Manifold platform to post blogs about ongoing research, essays and links to other publications. “People get to be part of the journey and be aware that the work is happening,” Smith says. “I can test what works rather than wait.” It has provided early feedback, increased collaboration and accountability, widened her perspective on her work, and expanded her creativity. Her photographs of an abandoned Alabama asylum will be posted as an online essay. “It’s another way of expression to help me in my emotional and thinking process,” Smith says. Smith, with input from her publisher, chose to work with Manifold, a publishing platform developed in collaboration between the University of Minnesota Press and the Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. Manifold allows more interactivity and multimedia than a conventional e-book.  In 2019, Emory participated in a Manifold pilot project to share knowledge and resources. Manifold staff have trained Emory staff and faculty to help show them how to formulate digital projects using its platform. “It was new for us and new for them. Emory has been a great partner for us to learn what is useful and meaningful for an institution — installing and using Manifold with faculty,” says Susan Doerr, an associate director of the University of Minnesota Press. Manifold’s digital flexibility is important to Smith, who wants to “capture the lived experience” of African Americans hospitalized in the poor conditions of psychiatric hospitals during the Jim Crow era in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.  She is working with the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship to find ways to translate her research into an engaging online experience. That innovative digital landscape includes interactive databases, documents, photographs or 3-D tours, maps and charts, videos or other multimedia. “Our goal is to work with the authors and presses to come up with designs and use these platforms to enable new forms of publications,” Tullos says. “The key is collaboration. No one person knows all the technology or the scholarship. It has been quite remarkable and well received.” As a former filmmaker, Smith began recording her interviews. While she was working with Rose Library archives, staff realized her work could fill a gap in their Civil Rights oral history collection. Together, they are creating a special collection called the Southern Mental Health History Project. “Writing a book is an isolating experience: I wouldn’t have ventured down this (digital) path on my own,” Smith says. “Emory is willing to collaborate and support me in resources, time and money. I have a team making this with me. It’s a great feeling.”;https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/01/digital-publishing/index.html;
Grants-in-Aid - Arte Publico Press;"The University of Houston US Latino Digital Humanities (USLDH) program is a digital scholarship/research undertaking to provide training and research on US Latino recovered materials. Proposals must draw from recovered primary and derivative sources produced by Latinas/os in what is now the United States, dating from the Colonial Period to 1980 (such as Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage collections, other repositories and/or the community). The Grants-in-Aid program is designed to provide a stipend to scholars for research and development of digital scholarship in the form of a digital publication and/or a digital project. The grant covers any expense connected with research that will advance a project to the next stage or to a successful conclusion. Descriptions of the 2021-22 and 2020-21 grants-in-aid cohorts are listed below. This project seeks to highlight the histories and lived experiences of people of African descent in pre-US California in order to examine the changing ways race has been made in California across various colonial regimes. It will identify, locate and recover historical primary or derivative documents and/or popular culture illustrating the long presence of Afro-Latina/os, Californios of mixed African descent and Black Mexican settlers and citizens (by birth and naturalization) in the regions of Spanish and Mexican Alta California that now comprise US California. The first phase of this project will consist of identifying and digitally mapping the location of relevant archival materials. PI: Caroline Collins, PhD

UC San Diego Tommie Camarillo, Chair of the Chicano Park Steering Committee (CPSC), Stewards of Chicano Park, for over 40 years, has maintained an extensive library/archive of the history of Chicano Park. Chicano Park and the Chicano Park Monumental murals located in Barrio Logan/Logan Heights in San Diego, California is a National Landmark (2016) and listed on the National Register (2013). The archive/library documents a community’s self-determination to defy the City of San Diego and the State of California to build their own park in response to the Intrusion of Interstate 5 and the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge that displaced 75 percent of the residents in less than 14 years. The Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center’s Logan Heights Archival project is to digitize and inventory the Tomasa Camarillo archive/library of Chicano Park and Community history and to highlight a unique archival method embodied in the life of Tommie Camarillo and rooted in community values and empowerment that comes from the heart.

The Festival was a Latina-organized, Latina-led, one-day street festival coordinated by Mujeres Latinas en Acción (MLEA), an important early Latina organization. The Festival provides a window into Chicago’s Mexicana-Chicana feminism in 1979—its individuals, groups and alliances across generations, ethnicities and races.

UC San Diego Co-PI: Diana SolisVisual Artist, Photographer & EducatorChicago, IL[Photo by Lucas Anti] The Latino Catskills is a digital project that resituates the rural Catskills region, located 100 miles northwest of New York City, as a generative space of Latino culture and identities. As this project documents, from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s, the Catskill mountains were a popular summer destination for countless Spaniards, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and others of Latin American descent. These Latino travelers took day trips (known as giras) or stayed at private dwellings and the many resorts owned by fellow Spanish speakers, such as the historic “Villas Hispanas” in Plattekill, New York. Our project reconstructs this important archive of Latino leisure culture through the development of a digital archive and map. By telling the stories of these forgotten sites, the project recenters recreation and leisure as important social components of the Latino experience, complementing dominant narratives of New York Latinidad, which have traditionally focused on the racialized experiences of urban poverty and toil.

Lehman College, CUNY The Música de los cultos africanos en Cuba collection consists of field recordings of music, chants and prayers produced by Lydia Cabrera and Josefina Tarafa in the mid-1950s, along with liner notes and photographs, and it is arguably the single most robust multimedia archive of Afro-Cuban musical traditions in the mid-20th century. Our project will develop an online, open access multimedia platform for the Música de los cultos recordings, creating a digital environment which will make the entire collection available to the public for the first time and establish a collaborative research project based on the recordings. The USLDH grant will support the creation of archival metadata for the collection and a proof of concept for a dynamic digital environment which incorporates the recordings, archival images, manuscripts and ephemera from the Lydia Cabrera Papers of the Cuban Heritage Collection, along with commentary from scholars, artists and priests.

University of Miami Libraries (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas: The Aida Barrera Digital Project highlights Aida Barrera’s career as creator of Carrascolendas. Through a close study of Carrascolendas, a bilingual children’s show produced during the 1970s in Austin, Texas, this digital humanities project demonstrates how Barrera, like other Latinas in the United States, engaged in social activism and contributed to race, gender and labor equality. While contextualizing Carrascolendas within broader histories, this project emphasizes the significance of Barrera’s labor and agency as a Latina in television production during the late twentieth century and examines how the Chicano and Civil Rights Movements influenced her approach to bilingual education. Additionally, (Re)Discovering Carrascolendas contributes to a wider understanding of race, gender, migration and language in the US-Mexico borderlands by underlining the immediate and long-term significance of Carrascolendas for Latino audiences.

Tejana Historias will additionally explore how the concepts of transborderism/transfronterizismo and transregionalism complicate these histories through a deep engagement of geography. This project will use both primary and secondary materials to provide a literal or figurative cultural/historical visualization that represents Tejana experiences. Visualizations will include artwork, photographs, newspaper articles, legal documents, treaties and maps, among other possible “artifacts.” The timeline will be composed of seven themes/periodizations: 1) Indigeneity y Tierra Natal, 2) Conquest and Colonization, 3) Migrations and Translocations within Modernity, 4) Empowering Communities in Juan Crow, 5) Articulations and Migrations, 6) Revolutions and Radical Transformations and 7) Reconquista. This phase of the project will concentrate on the first two themes and will be readily available for classrooms dedicated to social studies, Ethnic Studies or history as well as nontraditional educational settings as a tool of engagement for grade levels high school and above.

Lone Star College-North Harris, Houston El primer número del periódico La voz se publicó en Nueva York en julio de 1937, estableciendo desde su editorial que se trataba de una empresa de intenciones democráticas. La existencia de un periódico publicado en español en esos años en Estados Unidos no es un hecho extraordinario pues la prensa periódica de habla hispana era común desde el siglo XIX en otras ciudades como Boston, Washington y Filadelfia, pero los años en que se publica La voz resultan particularmente significativos por corresponder con el conflicto civil español y el auge del fascismo en Europa. Los lectores de La voz eran precisamente la colonia antifascista que vivía en la zona de Nueva York: hispanxs y latinxs progresistas, emigrantes y exiliadxs. La voz es una publicación crucial para entender la oposición de lxs hispanxs y latinxs al fascismo en los años treinta. El periódico La voz no se encuentra digitalizado y hay pocas copias microfilmadas en Estados Unidos. Mi proyecto aspira a crear un archivo digital de artículos de opinión publicados en la “Página de la mujer”. Este archivo servirá como un repositorio y herramienta de trabajo para entender el papel de las mujeres en esa sociedad cambiante e inestable, su activismo intelectual y sus revolucionarios esfuerzos en la lucha contra el fascismo. Este proyecto aspira a digitalizar los textos y hacerlos de libre acceso, recuperando los artículos de periodistas y activistas hispanas y latinas que publicaron en sus páginas durante esos años. Su trabajo intelectual sirve de base para el estudio de las fuertes conexiones entre feminismo y antifascismo que los artículos de La voz ponen de evidencia.

University of Connecticut #MAOD1889 is defined as the Modesta Avila: Obstructing Development Since 1889 multimedia, digital-arts project. Modesta Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Mexican/Mexican American folks. There are various versions of Modesta Avila's life and the various actions she took in the late 1880s to keep the Santa Fe Railroad from developing on her family's land, which was located in in the same region of what is now the San Juan Capistrano Train Station. The project will trace and focus on Modesta Avila’s life via a virtual timeline, a research contribution to the Recovery Program via their Omeka site and augmented reality. #MAOD1889 builds movement culture by preserving and re-presenting history from a people of color (POC) point of view. Among academic documentation, #MAOD1889 cites relevant photos, historical documents, media publications and urban tales from the community and local POC artists who have focused on Modesta Avila’s mugshot image to produce contemporary work. The archives will be used to source an online and book publication as well as a live hologram presentation. Through the use of the digital humanities, #MAOD1889 will provide readers and researchers the opportunity to scan the images with their phones and witness Modesta Avila come to life to tell her own story.

University of California-Berkeley The Puerto Rican Literature Project is a digital archive that maps the literary production of Puerto Rican writers from the archipelago and the diaspora since the Jones Act. It contains various photos, ephemera, and images of manuscripts in progress, some of which are housed at the archive at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, where a portion of this project began at a summer fellowship. In addition, we are creating various free digital teaching aids that educators can use to teach Puerto Rican literature in the classroom. Finally, the project will feature a page documenting the work of contemporary Puerto Rican writers through interviews, scholarly essays, craft talks, and book reviews.

92Y's Unterberg Poetry Center This project emphasizes the recovery of Ramírez’s maternal abuela’s writings. Her abuela, doña Ramona González, was born in El Paso, Texas in 1906 and wrote short stories, poems, fables, dichos, and more in 1960 – 1975. As an early Chicana writer, she published some of her writings in the important Chicano literary journal of El Grito’s (1967-1974) special issue Chicanas en la literatura y el arte of 1973. This project, however, focuses on doña Ramona’s seven hundred and fifty plus primary documents that she produced over her lifetime. Five years ago, the González/Hernández family (Ramírez’s immediate family) uncovered these documents tucked away in a cardboard box. These documents have now all been digitized, and a large majority have been translated by Dr. Ramírez’s father, Dr. Neil J. Devereaux. This project’s main goal is community accessibility of these primary document to the greater Latinx community. The Ramona González Papers Exhibit: The Ramona González Papers PI: Cristina Ramírez, PhD

UCLDH ONLINE: From Engagement to Retreat? Historians and Digital Preservation, 1968-2003 | UCL Centre for Digital Humanities - UCL – University College London;"UCL Centre for Digital Humanities 
              27 January 2021, 5:00 pm–7:00 pm             Ian Milligan (Uni of Waterloo) explores the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Despite the professional caricature of historians being uninterested in technology, historians have had a long track record of engaging with born-digital sources. This has necessarily involved critical conversations around digital preservation and access. These early encounters were driven by a wave of digitally-aware historians in the 1960s and 1970s, who were then then relatively central within the historical profession. The interdisciplinary journal Computers and the Humanities was established in 1966, and indeed, by 1970 the prospects for “computer-assisted historical projects” suggested the possibility of a wholescale transformation of the discipline. This current peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. At the same time, archivists and librarians were exploring digital preservation in earnest. During these first conversations about electronic records, historians played a prominent role at the table, helping to shape the conversation. This interdisciplinary engagement helped to shape early digital preservation efforts. Conversations would continue into the web age, with impact on this turn to networked information. By the mid-1990s, a small group of economic historians – tracing their lineage back to these early encounters – would help underscore the need for digital preservation and source stewardship. Their arguments presaged contemporary ones around computational history, forming an essential part of the historical context for any history of the digital humanities in general and digital history specifically. Yet, by the late 1990s (with some exceptions), historians largely disappeared from the conversation – unfortunately at a time when they were needed more than ever. In this presentation, part of my broader project “Averting the Digital Dark Age,” I explore the relationship between historians and born-digital primary sources between 1968 and 2003. Electronic records, to these historians, imperilled society’s collective memory. What was to be done?

Drawing on my experience co-editing the volume The Digital Black Atlantic for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series (University of Minnesota Press) with Kelly Baker Josephs, this talk explores the challenges of putting postcolonial digital humanities into practice by producing a volume on African diaspora digital humanities. From series editors who struggled to see the difference between our proposed volume on the digital black Atlantic and another proposed volume on global digital humanities to difficult editorial choices we encountered, the process of assembling the volume raised the critical question of how “the digital” travels throughout the African diaspora, changing and being changed by local contexts for digital knowledge production. The roots and routes of the digital in the African diaspora - from Nigeria to Dominica to South Africa to the United States to Jamaica and on - offer a critical transformation of digital humanities praxis that, I argue, is a practice of cultural survival necessary to ensuring a central place for the African diaspora in the digital cultural record.

The case of Tholos IV at the Palace of Nestor In 1953 Lord William Taylour directed the excavation of a monumental vaulted tholos tomb known as ‘Tholos IV’, a stone’s throw away from the later discovered and infamous ‘Griffin Warrior Grave’ at the site of ancient Pylos, Messenia, Greece. The excavation was conducted over two months, from which detailed notes were recorded in three notebooks now kept in the Archives of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The formal publication of Tholos IV, however, contains only a basic narrative of the excavation, offering neither precise detail on stratigraphy, object find spots, nor even a complete inventory of small finds. The present study rebuilds virtually Taylour’s excavation, combining data from the original notebooks with a new digital survey of Tholos IV. A comprehensive and accurate 3D GIS model for Taylour’s excavation has now been built that lets one wind back the discovery of the tomb. Furthermore, the GIS has been produced in such a way that its dataset is directly comparable with new excavation data currently generated in the ongoing Palace of Nestor Excavations (PONEX) project. Discussion follows on how the production of this GIS deepens our understanding not just of the legacy excavation, but also of the site and its wider landscape. To view Dr Loy’s talk, please  here.  Thursday 18th March, 5pm Open to all, via Zoom (please email k.l.mcdonald@exeter.ac.uk for the link) Dr Daisy Dunn In a Nutshell: The World According to Pliny Pliny the Elder – historian, statesman, and tragic victim of the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 – left behind the most remarkable account of the world in the shape of his encyclopaedia of Natural History. Covering everything from the habits of elephants to the perils of oysters, the book makes for particularly fascinating reading today as we refocus our efforts on protecting the environment. In this original talk, author Dr Daisy Dunn – winner of the 2020 Classical Association Prize – offers an entertaining tour through this most surprising of ancient books, uncovering observations to inspire – and to puzzle – as we seek to draw closer to nature.  Daisy Dunn is an author and classicist. Her books include In the Shadow of Vesuvius: A Life of Pliny, Of Gods and Men: 100 Stories from Ancient Greece and Rome, Homer: A Ladybird Expert Book, Catullus’ Bedspread: The Life of Rome’s Most Erotic Poet and The Poems of Catullus: A New Translation.  Wednesday 28th April, 5pm Open to all, via Zoom (please email k.l.mcdonald@exeter.ac.uk for the link) Dr Dan Diffendale (American Academy in Rome) The Stones that Rome was Built With (during the Monarchy and Republic) The city of Rome was already populated with temples and other monuments centuries before the introduction of those stereotypical Roman building materials, concrete and marble. As early as the 6th century BCE, Roman builders began to exploit the natural resources of the city’s volcanic landscape, quarrying a variety of local tuffs to use as building stone. Developing scientific techniques allow these stones to be traced to their quarries of origin in and around Rome. The results of these analyses indicate a higher degree of architectural and economic sophistication among early Roman builders than previously understood, and they suggest some new ways of understanding the work of Roman laborers.

 Recommend it Silke Schwandt, Universität Bielefeld, Deutschland 1. Why did you choose this topic? I have been working in the field of Digital Humanities for quite some time and one of the biggest challenges was always to find projects willing to embark on the - often complicated - journey of implementing computational methods in the humanities. So I decided to make a book about the challenges, but also the ideas and perspectives that lie in wait for those who do engage with digital humanities methods. I am grateful to all contributors for letting other researchers in on their experiences. 2. What new perspectives does your book offer? The books offers a unique insight into the everyday practices of a big cooperative project with its organizational challenges as well as the chances and opportunities such collaborations yield. Every article speaks from its own disciplinary perspective, which allows us to evaluate the impact of digital research methods in different humanities disciplines. 3. What makes your topic relevant for current research debates? The field of Digital Humanities is evolving quickly and some see it as an emerging discipline in its own right within the humanities. Its genuinely interdisciplinary nature works against that, though, and our book shows this by highlighting the disciplinary gains through computational methods, but also pointing out the different challenges and theoretical as well as methodological critiques that come from the various research fields the authors represent. 4. Choose one person you would like to discuss your book with! That is a difficult question. But I guess I would like to discuss it with my father who had nothing to do with academia but who believed in me and was always supportive of my endeavors big and small. This book certainly bears witness to that. Within academia, I would like to discuss this with any humanities scholar who is still reluctant about the digital turn and hear his or her reasons. I might just be able to convince them otherwise. 5. Your book summary in one sentence: Digital Methods in the Humanities is a tour guide for the journey into Digital Humanities providing practical insights as well as warnings about the pitfalls along the way.

Specifcally, Swanstrom addresses works which allow nature to correspond with humans in a shared environment, posing provocative questions about the idea of agency itself as expressed in an ecology of action.

This essay is excerpted from Swanstrom's monograph, Animal, Vegetable, Digital: Experiments in New Media Aesthetics and Environmental Poetics (under contract to be published by the University of Alabama Press).   Mark C. Marino explains the rationale for the Critical Code Studies Working Group, a six-week experiment in using social media for collaborative academic production. Marino also analyzes the first week's discussion, which focused on debates about what it means to read ""code as text."" Entering the 'cyberdebates' initiated by Nick Montfort, John Cayley, and Rita Raley, new media scholar Mark Marino proposes that we should analyze and explicate code as a text like any other, 'a sign system with its own rhetoric' and cultural embeddedness.

Feminism, Activism, and the Digital Humanities: An Interview with Danica Savonick | HASTAC;"Fostering innovative and open methods and tools in the classroom and beyond. Expanding the scope and impact of traditional and digital humanities for the contemporary world. Thinking critically about the role and design of technology, data and the social sciences in our lives and learning. Promoting openness, access, and diversity in technology, and education in service of an equitable society. Promoting change in schools, museums, libraries, and other organizations. Advocating for new forms of scholarly communications, including blogging, multimedia, open publishing, and academic journals and presses. I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Danica Savonick over the phone on May 18, 2020. I am grateful for her time and energy towards this project and especially appreciate the opportunity to elevate her important insights about the transformative power and potential risks of using digital technologies in the classroom. As the pandemic ravages on, her considerations here remain all too relevant as teachers continue to adapt to the online classroom while working to equip students with the critical thinking skills necessary to grapple with this historical moment.  Rebekah Aycock: How did you come into the field of digital humanities? Danica Savonick: Well, I think like a lot of us I came into the field indirectly.  In 2012, when I began grad school, I was involved in some organizing, especially organizations coming out of the Occupy Wall Street movement. With Occupy Sandy we were trying to help out in the aftermath of the hurricane that had devastated the city and we were trying to get resources to people who needed them. I was also involved with the Free University of New York City where we would host pop-up universities throughout the city, and professors from Columbia, NYU, CUNY, The New School, and Rutgers would come and hold their classes outside in these parks alongside activists and local community organizers who taught workshops and skillshares. With this organizing, I was interested in the behind-the-scenes ways that we were using technology. I worked with the website and social media and became interested in the power of platforms to get the word out and spread awareness about things, and also how tools allowed us to collaborate on large projects. Through these activist efforts, we used technology to bring people together, share resources, and support marginalized communities. I became interested in how technologies can be used to do good in society.  I also pursued a PhD at the CUNY Graduate Center where there was a lively digital humanities community. The majority of the DH I was exposed to was people using technology for activist purposes, and to support pedagogy, students, and advocacy for marginalized communities. I was really excited by Cathy Davidson’s arrival at CUNY. She brought HASTAC and started the Futures Initiative, programs dedicated to equity and innovation in higher education. So it wasn’t necessarily the kind of distance-reading version of the digital humanities, it was exploring how we can use technology in service to social change.  The last key moment that I’ll mention was that I went to a summer HILT workshop (Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching) organized by Roopika Risam and micha cárdenas on de/postcolonial digital humanities. That gave me broader exposure to these activist traditions of digital humanities - people who were using technology to do feminist, anti-racist, queer, post-colonial research.  RA: How did being involved with the HASTAC community contribute to your graduate education and now your career?  DS: HASTAC changed everything. There’s no way I would be where I am today were it not for HASTAC. I started as a HASTAC scholar, writing blog posts, contributing to collections like The Pedagogy Project, and attending HASTAC conferences. Participating in this kind of online scholarly community raised new questions for me. How does a blog post differ from a peer-reviewed journal article? How can we write about complex research in a way that is exciting and engaging and will keep someone wanting to read even if they are exhausted after a long day of teaching? For decades, famous feminists like Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, and Toni Cade Bambara have been urging readers, writers, and publishers to consider the material conditions that underscore reading, writing, thinking, and teaching. Readers might work multiple jobs, maybe they have a family, maybe they can only read for a few minutes here and there. All of that is to say that HASTAC has taught me a lot about audience.  HASTAC also gave me the sense that my research was in conversation with audiences beyond my graduate program and even beyond my discipline. This interdisciplinary audience forces you not to use jargon and also to try to provide vivid, tangible examples to support your points. Writing is kind of like teaching in that sense, right? Students aren’t going to believe something is true because you say it, you have to provide them compelling evidence and examples without jargon. ________________________________________________________________________ ""...when students have a sense that their words are going to be read by someone beyond the classroom, that a student in another college classroom might be reading it, then it’s going to actually have an impact and they’re more motivated to create something that they are proud of and that they care about."" ________________________________________________________________________ HASTAC also impacted my teaching. Every semester now my courses conclude not with a final paper that’s submitted only to me but with some kind of public project or blog post that can be read by audiences beyond our classroom. Sometimes this takes the form of an actual post on HASTAC. Stephen Berg, a member of the HASTAC community, created a group called Scholarly Voices within HASTAC to showcase undergraduate writing. Students can read the work of other undergraduates and then write their own post for that group. I’ve been so excited by the ways that these kinds of public writing assignments increase the quality of student writing. Sometimes when students are only submitting something for the professor it can feel tedious, like, “Why are you torturing me? Why are you making me revise these sentences over and over and over again?” But when students have a sense that their words are going to be read by someone beyond the classroom, that a student in another college classroom might be reading it, then it’s going to actually have an impact and they’re more motivated to create something that they are proud of and that they care about.  HASTAC has also taught me about the importance of networks and communities. I came to realize that for those of us who are interested in teaching and social change, part of that activism is sharing what has worked well for us in our own classrooms so that other people in other classrooms and contexts can learn them and build off of that. It's interesting how a contemporary online network like HASTAC has shaped my archival and historical research on feminist pedagogy. For decades, scholars, activists, and teachers have created these kinds of teaching communities and shared resources, syllabi, lesson plans, and assignments. They’ve reflected on their teaching and written about what works, as well as other failures and missteps along the way. My research only goes back to the 60s and 70s - I’m sure you could find activist communities going much farther back than that. RA: How can the digital humanities gain greater legitimacy in traditional academic spaces? How does this work count, or not, when often it’s not taken as seriously or is seen as supplemental, or it just doesn’t get recognized by the usual metrics evaluating scholarly work?  DS:  I think that institutions need to shift what counts as knowledge. Katina Rogers’ recent book Putting the Humanities PhD to Work argues that expanding what we value and what we reward as scholarship can make higher education more equitable, inclusive, engaged, and responsive to the needs of diverse communities. The Torn Apart/Separados project always comes to mind as an example of what engaged, transformative, digital scholarship can look like.  RA: I really loved your piece “Timekeeping as Feminist Pedagogy.” It was something I could relate to as a student and brought up concerns I’ve tried to address as a teacher - thinking about our responsibility to actively make space for student contributions. How do you think the digital humanities can serve as a radical feminist space for teachers? DS: I love that question. In some ways, digital humanities is bringing attention to some of the things that feminists have actually been doing and saying for years. At least in terms of feminist pedagogy, something that may seem new - like having students do a collaborative, public project instead of a paper - has roots in feminist and anti-racist activism.  For years, intersectional, Black, and women of color feminists have been exploring how women and people of color have historically produced knowledge in ways that have not necessarily gotten to count as legitimate or important and that have not been valued by academic institutions. I think of Alice Walker’s essay ""In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens"" and how gardening and quilting have been key artforms for Black women. I also think of Barbara Christian’s ""The Race for Theory,"" which looks at how Black women’s creative, intellectual work - plays, poems, songs, and stories - hasn’t gotten to count as theory. All of that applies to academia as well. We don’t all think and produce knowledge in the format of a scholarly monograph. I think it’s a feminist project to expand what counts as research, in classrooms and at every other scale of the institution. Digital humanities has brought attention to the fact that research can take the format of a timeline, or a website, or a podcast, something that Black, intersectional, and women of color feminists have been saying for many years now.  Another example: Since at least the 1960s, activist educators have been developing assignments that challenge students to write for different audiences and communities. For example, author, activist and “cultural worker” Toni Cade Bambara told students “do not write term papers for me… make sure they are useful for someone else as well” and would suggest formats, such as a magazine, puppet show, annotated bibliography, or activist event on campus.  ________________________________________________________________________ ""At its best, digital platforms can help us nurture students’  activist sensibilities: that idea that when you see something that is missing, when you see a problem in society, how can you use whatever skills, resources, knowledge that you have access to in order to address that problem in some way?"" ________________________________________________________________________ This resonates with contemporary digital humanities pedagogy. Cathy Davidson writes really well about having students make a public contribution to knowledge. At its best, digital platforms can help us nurture students’ activist sensibilities: that idea that when you see something that is missing, when you see a problem in society, how can you use whatever skills, resources, knowledge that you have access to in order to address that problem in some way? As someone who works at the intersection of feminist pedagogy and digital humanities, I often think of that as my job: helping students figure out where are the gaps, where are the omissions in dominant narratives in society, what information is missing? How can I help students develop a project that is interesting and meaningful, that makes an impact not only on them as learners but on audiences and communities beyond the classroom? RA: With the current situation with Covid-19, which has really exacerbated disparities across the board as we’re increasingly dependent on online spaces, how do you see the digital humanities stepping in in the coming months?  DS: I think scholars who have been warning us about the dangers of proprietary educational technologies are especially important right now. I teach a course called ""Digital Divides: Race, Class, and Gender in the Age of the Internet"" and we spend a lot of time talking about how digital technologies often exacerbate existing inequalities in society, but also how they can be used to promote equity. I’m thinking here of figures like Jesse Stommel and everyone involved with Hybrid Pedagogy, Erin Glass and the Ethical EdTech project, Safiya Noble’s Algorithms of Oppression, everything by Audrey Watters, and Chris Gilliard and Hugh Culik’s work on digital redlining. Universities spend a lot of money to make sure students aren’t cheating on tests, but those technologies often discriminate and are grounded in surveillance and policing. Instead, we should invest in creative, meaningful, and exciting assignments that help students develop transferable skills like collaboration.  I think we have much to learn from those who have been teaching engaged, student-centered, transformative, activist online classes for decades: people like Lee Skallerup Bessette and the members of FemTechNet. This pandemic has also shown us how important it is to have networks like HASTAC where people can share ideas and resources and information quickly, when academia is not at all known for its speed. As we abruptly moved online last spring, HASTAC helped circulate Brandon Bayne’s “adjusted syllabus,” Jacqueline Wernimont’s “Resources for Those About to Start Teaching Online Due to Covid 19,"" and has since served as a space for us to share strategies for online teaching. What do you think?  RA: Well, I feel what you’re saying, and I’m just very grateful to be in a department that understands and is trying to, imperfectly, put a lot of these things into practice. It’s hard to reckon with online teaching normally, let alone right now. Now is so not the time to prove a point about rigor or productivity. This is an opportunity to put a lot of what we teach in American Studies into practice. If we really do believe that disparities, like with race and gender, exist, if we say we take all of that seriously and it doesn’t resonate in our response to moving online, then it doesn’t mean much of anything. So I think what we pull from DH should be about these creative responses, but not in an attempt to recreate or add to the burdens of students or teachers.  I did finally want to ask about your book manuscript. Could you share some about that project? DS: Yeah, definitely. I’m completing a manuscript Insurgent Knowledge: The Poetics and Pedagogy of Toni Cade Bambara, June Jordan, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich in the Era of Open Admissions. In the late 1960s, amidst the height of the Women’s Movement, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, and protests against the Vietnam War, these authors were teaching down the hall from one another at Harlem’s City College. Through archival research on their syllabi, lesson plans, and assignments, the project explores the reciprocal relations between teaching and writing in their work. I’m interested in the ways they drew on their activism and work as writers to develop creative methods of teaching students to advocate for social change, and the ways that their work with students impacted their writing. I’m also interested in their advocacy for public higher education.  ________________________________________________________________________ ""...for these writers, teaching was a meaningful form of intellectual, creative, and political work, deeply related to their writing. I’m hoping that by sharing some of their stories, we can think more deeply about the collective value of learning, not just for individuals, but for the collective flourishing of our society."" ________________________________________________________________________ I do think there’s a real devaluation of teaching in our society. It’s seen as the less important thing that professors do and is often treated as secondary to research. But for these writers, teaching was a meaningful form of intellectual, creative, and political work, deeply related to their writing. I’m hoping that by sharing some of their stories, we can think more deeply about the collective value of learning, not just for individuals, but for the collective flourishing of our society.    Danica Savonick, PhD is an Assistant Professor of English at SUNY Cortland, where she teaches courses on multicultural literature, feminism, and digital humanities.  Rebekah Aycock is a PhD Candidate in American Studies at the University of Kansas.

Planning your DH Institute: What and Why | The National Endowment for the Humanities;"Alert for Individual Applicants: Grants.gov & Deadline Extensions Flamingoes, study folder for the book Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom by Abbott Handerson Thayer. Smithsonian American Art Museum This is the first of three posts (post 2  | post 3 ) written to help you conceptualize and describe your Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities. Note: This was originally published in 2020. It has been updated for the 2021 application cycle.   The concept behind the Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities (IATDH) program is simple.   These awards provide funds for digital humanists of all kinds to bring people together with the goal of learning about advanced methodological or conceptual approaches to DH, and building community among practitioners with shared interests. Defining the format for an IATDH is up to you. An IATDH might be organized around a disciplinary theme (like archaeology), a technical problem (like GIS), or a methodological challenge (like Indigenous DH). It might be held as a residential three-week summer institute, a series of three-day workshops, or a hybrid multi-year program with in-person and virtual components. It might be taught or attended by advanced graduate students, faculty members, librarians, technical experts, or other humanities professionals. Our goal with these blog posts, then, is not to tell you how to organize your IATDH. Instead, we want to encourage you to consider proposing an IATDH, and to provide insight into what happens to proposals as they go through the review process. We want to draw your attention to how the review criteria connect to your proposal, and to patterns that we have observed after reading hundreds of pages of aggregated peer review feedback. With this first post, we’ll be focusing on the Significance and the Curriculum and Work Plan sections of the grant proposal, and talking about them in terms of the following review criteria: You can find a full explanation of the review criteria in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate the project’s intellectual significance for the humanities. To consider how this is done, let’s look at an example from the first section of the application for Early Modern Digital Agendas, a 2013 IATDH from the Folger Shakespeare Library: Recent debates concerning Digital Humanities (DH) have raised major methodological and epistemological issues at the core of DH approaches to literature. Yet most scholars of early modern literature recognize that they cannot return to a point before digital technologies; they need to acquire digital literacy. What makes this an effective statement of intellectual significance for the humanities? It identifies a need (digital literacy) within a humanities-specific discipline (early modern literature), and shows how the institute will address that need. Emphasizing the humanities significance is particularly important for programs that focus on a technical area, like cartography, text encoding, or big data analysis. Readers want to know that you will be pushing the humanities forward with your institute. If a proposal is too focused on skill building, absent a clear sense of its applicability to the questions and concerns of humanities scholars and professionals, reviewers may mark it down. Other areas that reviewers highlight when evaluating the significance of a program include: the relevance of the topic for the intended audience, the need for the program given the current landscape of professional development opportunities, and programmatic attention to long-term impact. Here’s how the Early Modern Digital Agendas proposal addressed those topics: Early Modern Digital Agendas seeks to create a forum in which participants can historicize, theorize, and critically evaluate current and future digital tools and approaches in early modern studies, with discussion growing out of, and feeding back into, their own projects. As part of a culminating digital footprint, the participants will produce a DH resources hub for early modernists. In addition to humanities significance, reviewers look for both quality and clarity of expression when reviewing the significance section, which should be accessible to an audience of non-expert readers: reviewers express concern if the language seems overly technical or esoteric. At the same time, reviewers express concern when they feel like a project has not been fully conceptualized. This may occur when the relationship between the goals of the institute and the curriculum has not been clearly articulated, or when reviewers are not convinced that the structure of the institute best suited to accomplish the program’s goals. Reviewers want to see consistency among the needs being met, the community being served, and the pedagogical approach being taken. Return applicants should take note that this section now encompasses what was formerly two sections: the ""curriculum"" and ""work plan."" New for 2021, your narrative description will be supplemented by a required detailed work plan and schedule, to be attached separately in Attachment 3: Work plan and course outline. Note that the comments here refer specifically to the narrative section, but may also apply to Attachment 3. Also new to this section for 2021 is a request for information about planning for changes in your institute once the project is underway.  As we have all learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, you must have a Plan B and we want to you to describe your strategies in your application. So you will need to identify any risks that may occur, such as staff attrition and travel restrictions, and note how they might adversely affect the overall schedule. For example, could you move from an in-person to an online institute to mitigate these risks? Applicants may take a number of different approaches to describing their curriculum in the narrative section. For example, Early Modern Digital Agendas offered a day-by-day overview of the planned institute, including the topics of study and names of guest speakers. In contrast, in the application for the Digital Methods for Military History, a 2020-2021 institute, the proposers provided a brief overview of the general organizational structure, and included a detailed schedule as an appendix. In other cases, we have seen the ""curriculum"" used to describe a pedagogical philosophy or approach. Because the ""curriculum"" section is also where the institute’s organizational structure is described, reviewers look here for an explanation of why you decided to hold, say, a one-week residential institute, or a multi-year virtual program. While there are many, many ways to organize an institute, the key is communicating how your decisions were made, and how they will help participants to achieve the institute’s goals. For example, in the case of one successful proposal, a reviewer remarked that the institute was well thought out and attentive to best practices in digital pedagogy. In another case, a reviewer lauded the proposal’s serious attention to the specific pedagogical needs of the intended participant group. Reviewers express concern when they feel that the way the institute will be carried out is unclear, and they sometimes have questions about specific features, like why a lecture was offered instead of a hands-on session, or whether there’s enough time scheduled for community development or creative experimentation. (Pro tip: when we get feedback from program organizers at the end of an institute, they also often express regret that they didn’t schedule more time for community development and creative experimentation.) Reviewers will also identify gaps in a curriculum; for example, reviewers often express concern when an institute offers technical skills without building in time to focus on the ethical challenges of a particular tool or approach. But without question, the most common concern that reviewers express is when a curriculum appears to be overloaded. Reviewers will take note if the curriculum seems to be covering too many topics, or if the schedule looks overly busy. The answer here, as is so often the case, is to develop focused, achievable plans. When it comes to teaching, less is almost always more! The ""work plan"" is where you describe the steps involved in organizing and running your institute. Based on feedback from past IATDH organizers, we can say that these are labor-intensive programs that require careful planning and implementation. Some aspects of the work plan that were included in the successful 2019 Further Expanding Communities of Practice proposal, for example, include hiring an institute coordinator, recruiting participants, arranging travel, scheduling curriculum planning meetings, arranging institute logistics, and scheduling post-institute mentorship and support. Though this section isn’t lengthy, note the level of detail here: one common concern raised by reviewers is that a work plan is “vague” or “murky.” When work plans are well-received, they are most often lauded for their “specificity.” Another concern that reviewers consistently raise has to do with labor. They want to be sure that all the work can get done, and that compensation is appropriate to the amount of time required for the program. It can be helpful to name the individuals who will be responsible for various tasks in the work plan (and make sure they also appear in the budget justification).  Ultimately, when it comes to the project narrative, reviewers are looking for evidence of a specific and clearly-defined vision. In the next post, we’ll talk about what’s involved in showing that you’ve done the planning necessary to make your vision a reality.

NYCDH Week – A Celebration of DH in the City;"NYCDH is happy to announce the 7th Annual NYCDH Week, February 7-11, 2022. Taking place at institutions home throughout New York City everywhere (again!), NYCDH Week gives individuals who are interested in digital humanities an opportunity to learn new techniques and skills, hear about DH projects, and become part of a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners. This year’s NYCDH Week theme is Support, as we build off of last year’s Care/Repair to show how a DH community can come together to support one another. While COVID still impacts us on a daily basis, and much of the focus of this DH Week will be on how to support one another in times of crisis, we also look to think beyond the pandemic and how we can reach out, and share our experiences, specialties, and sense of togetherness on a regular basis. This intention will come through in the roundtable we have planned for the kickoff event and through the annual announcement and presentation of the NYCDH Graduate Student Awards. In addition, we have added a series of support sessions that will provide our community with skills beyond the technical and academic realm, including project management, proposal and grant development, and early career development. Stay tuned for details about those. As we did last year NYCDH Week 2022 will take place in a fully online format, while continuing to do what it has done for the past six years — bring together individuals across the region who are interested in digital humanities, offering them opportunities to learn new techniques and skills, to hear about DH projects from across the city, and to connect with a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners.  The sculpture Support by Lorenzo Quinn In place of a traditional keynote lecture, this year’s kickoff event will feature a roundtable titled “Finding, Cultivating, and Sustaining Support for Your DH Project.” This roundtable will bring into conversation a variety of perspectives on the services, structures, and approaches necessary to conceive of and execute successful digital projects from experts in this field. The roundtable and subsequent discussion will help familiarize our NYCDH community with the wide range of structures of support that are available to NYCDH members and how to go about gaining access to that support. Read more here Roundtable participants will include As is tradition, following the introduction and kickoff roundtable we will be announcing the winners of our annual Graduate Student Awards with presentations by the winners, as NYCDH continues to support the next generation of scholars in the field.

UK-Ireland collaboration in digital humanities – UKRI;"Last updated: 12 April 2021                     Apply for funding for digital humanities research. Your project must be large, innovative and multidisciplinary. UK and Ireland-based researchers must collaborate on the project. The themes are: AHRC will provide up to £320,000 per project for UK costs, at 80% of the full economic cost. The Irish Research Council (IRC) will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%). Your project must start on 1 August 2021 and last for up to 36 months. Standard eligibility criteria (please see section two of AHRC’s research funding guide) will apply to this call for UK investigators and research organisations. This means that the UK principal investigator must be resident in the UK and based at a UK institution eligible to receive funding from UKRI. The AHRC expects the principal investigator and any co-investigators to devote an average of at least four hours per week to the project. The UK component must fall within the remit of AHRC. Inter-disciplinary proposals are welcome but the majority of the methodologies, research questions and outputs must fall within AHRC’s subject remit. Full details of all project partner organisations should be included in the application and be accompanied by a project partner letter of support. Guidance on what needs to be included in a project partner letter of support is provided on page 71 of the AHRC research funding guide. Co-investigators from other countries can be included within the UK costs in accordance with AHRC’s international co-investigator policy where it can be demonstrated (in the case for support) that they will add value to the UK-Ireland collaboration. Please refer to the AHRC research funding guide for further information on AHRC’s international co-investigator policy and which costs are eligible within a UK budget. The Irish principal investigator and co-investigators can be active in all disciplinary areas as per the IRC’s pan-disciplinary mandate, provided that the consortium’s scope falls within the digital humanities field. Irish PIs must be contracted by an Irish HEI, with a contract of sufficient duration to carry out the proposed research from the project start date until the project end date. In the event of an applicant, who is already a PI in another project being successful in this call, at award acceptance stage they will be asked to submit a time-management strategy, to be approved by the IRC before the award’s commencement. There are no restrictions on the eligibility of non-academic partners (museums, cultural institutions, private companies, NGOs etc.). Should they not be Irish-based, the rationale behind their inclusion must be clearly justified. Please note that attendance at the programme’s UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Networking Workshop (October 2019), and/or engagement with its Research Networking Call, is not a pre-condition of application to this call. Specifically, the call aims to support a diverse range of projects that: The projects should take innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to explore the broad and inclusive themes: AHRC expects to provide up to £400,000 full economic cost (fEC), paid at 80% (up to £320,000), for the UK costs of each funded research project. The IRC will provide up to €270,000 (paid at 100%).  Each award must start by 1 August 2021 and should have a duration of up to 36 months. The principal investigator in the UK will be responsible for submitting a joint UK-Ireland proposal through the research council’s Joint Electronic Submission system (Je-S). Applications should be submitted through the Je-S system by 18 March 2021 16:00, and will need to go through the appropriate institution submission process prior to this. To prepare a proposal form in Je-S: Je-S will then create a proposal form, displaying the relevant section headings. Using the blue question marks and the ‘Help’ link at the top of each section will provide guidance relevant to that section of the form. The Je-S submission portal allows for only one principal investigator to be included in a proposal. For this AHRC-IRC call, there is to be one principal investigator from the UK and one from Ireland. On the Je-S form the principal investigator is therefore the UK PI and the Irish PI needs to be recorded as a co-investigator. Such terminology must be considered as a built-in system feature, and does not challenge the equal status and co-leadership of the UK and Irish PI. All investigators named on the Je-S application form, whether based in the UK or Ireland, must have a Je-S account. Where a named investigator does not already have a Je-S account, one can be easily set up, but please note that the process can take a number of days. It is therefore strongly recommended that the process is started well before the application deadline. Following the deadline for submission, all proposals will be checked for eligibility. After the deadline for submissions, PIs will be informed of any outstanding return for amendment requirements. Five working days will be given for the return for amendment process. More information about this process will be provided at the relevant stage of the call. Eligible proposals will be reviewed by AHRC and IRC nominated reviewers and there will a principal investigator response stage in April/May 2021. The PI response should be submitted by the UK principal investigator in consultation with the Irish principal investigator. A joint moderating panel will take place in early June where the eligible proposals will be graded and ranked. The panel will be comprised of members of the AHRC’s Peer Review College and academic reviewers nominated by the IRC. The panel will moderate the reviewers’ scores for each proposal, agree a ranked priority list of applications and make funding recommendations to the AHRC and the IRC. The panel will be asked to be consider the following criteria when making recommendations to the AHRC and IRC for funding.

Electronic Literature [Frame]works for the Creative Digital Humanities › electronic book review;electronic book review digital futures of literature, theory, criticism, and the arts “Electronic Literature [Frame]works for the Creative Digital Humanities,” edited by Scott Rettberg and Alex Saum-Pascual, gathers a selection of articles exploring the evolving relationship between electronic literature and the digital humanities in Europe, North and South America. Looking at the combination of practices and methodologies that come about through e-lit’s production, study, and dissemination, these articles explore the disruptive potential of electronic literature to decenter and complement the DH field. Creativity is central and found at all levels and spheres of e-lit, but as the articles in this gathering show, there is a need to redeploy creative practice critically to address the increasing instrumentalization of the digital humanities and to turn the digital humanities towards the digital cultures of the present. Conceived as an ongoing conversation, rolling out 2-3 articles each month until the end of the year, all contributions are tackling at least one of the four following areas: Building Research Infrastructures and Environments, Exploring Creative Research Practice, Proposing Critical Reading Methodologies, and Applying Digital Pedagogy. “Introduction: Electronic Literature Frameworks for the Digital Humanities” by Scott Rettberg and Alex Saum – August 2020 “Appealing to your better judgment: A Call for Database Criticism” by Hannah Ackermans – August 2020 “Something there badly not wrong: The Life and Death of Literary Form in Databases” by Joseph Tabbi – August 2020 “Building STEAM for DH and Electronic Literature: An Educational Approach to Nurturing the STEAM Mindset in Higher Education” by Claudia von Vacano et al. – October 2020 “Documenting a Field: The Life and Afterlife of the ELMCIP Collaborative Research Project and Electronic Literature Knowledge Base” by Scott Rettberg – January 2021 “Digital Creativity as Critical Material Thinking: The Disruptive Potential of Electronic Literature” by Alex Saum – August 2020 “Addressing Significant Societal Challenges Through Critical Digital Media” by Scott Rettberg and Roderick Coover – August 2020 “What Should the System Say?

“Blog Post: What Do Girls Dig? | Bethany Nowviskie” in “Debates in the Digital Humanities” on Debates in the DH Manifold;"PART III ][ Blog Posts What Do Girls Dig? BETHANY NOWVISKIE “Has data-mining in the humanities emerged as a gentleman’s sport? Two and a half conversations about gender, language, and the ‘Digging into Data Challenge.’” A two-day conference has been announced, associated with an international funding program, rightly (I think) hailed as transformative for the humanities. I was excited. I ed the link. I scrolled down. I did a double take, which means I scrolled up and then down again. Next, I scrolled very slowly, counting. I almost didn’t tweet this, but then I did: Instant feedback: There were some other comments, and retweets, too. I was starting to feel a little sheepish about sparking a negative and public discussion of an issue uncomfortable for many, and about which I often feel ambivalent—but I knew that the group would shortly hear from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), one of several funders of the program. These guys are always plugged in and ever responsive. If you “welcome suggestions” on Twitter, you will get them. More with the instant feedback: Those were the serious suggestions, taken seriously. (Another NEH staffer picked up the thread on my Facebook page and gave a very sensitive and cogent response, including an appeal for names of particular researchers and communities of practice to reach out to.) Meanwhile, things on Twitter seemed to get silly. But maybe these questions about the rhetoric of data mining actually get at another side of a serious issue. At the very least, they gesture at a subtler, but equally worthwhile brand of digital humanities outreach: attention to our language. So …what do girls dig? On Facebook—where a colleague pointed out what he called a similar “boys on the podium” gender imbalance in a “future of academic libraries” symposium (“the future is manly!”)—the discussion generated a steady, ridiculous, and slightly dangerous stream of jokes. A manly future for libraries in beer and electric guitars. Flowered gloves and gardening trowels as more appropriate for ladylike digging into data. A duty to lie back and think of England as our data furrows are ploughed. That last one was mine. And since I started this whole mess, and in a rather flippant way, you may think I’m just full of snark. In fact, I believe NEH and other “Digging into Data” supporters do a consistently brilliant job of identifying sensitive and qualified peer reviewers and funding worthy projects. NEH’s digital humanities programs, in particular, always strike me as broadly representative of the actual makeup of the field. I’m sure that gender imbalance in this area has little to do with the Digging into Data grant-making process and more with broader issues, going all the way back (yes, that chestnut) to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education for girls in the public schools. But mostly, I suspect, all this is about the number of female academics both qualified and inclined to do data-mining work, and who find themselves both at a stage of their careers and possessed of adequate collaborative networks to support their applications for such grants. Although it wasn’t exactly what I was going for, I respect my pals’ advocacy, highlighted earlier, for funders’ launching of an aggressive campaign to identify and mentor more women applicants for programs like “Digging into Data.” And clearly there’s institutional work to be done on the level of our schools, colleges, and universities. Personally, however, I feel less strongly about both of those things than I do about the need for the entire digital humanities (DH) community to be as thoughtful as possible about the way we describe this kind of work—about the language we use. I’ve heard three kinds of responses from female colleagues and students about the “Digging into Data” Challenge. One (the rarest) is simple enthusiasm; though it’s interesting that presumably few women applied and none of their projects were compelling enough to fund. Another is trepidation: Is this too hardcore? Involving too much math or statistical analysis I never learned? Do I understand the scholarly possibilities and have the support network I’d need? In other words: this is a challenge. Am I competitive? (in every sense of that word). The third kind of response (which includes my own) has more to do with framing and rhetoric. I suspect I haven’t gotten super-interested in this kind of work because I’ve heard few descriptions of it that really speak to my own interpretive/hermeneutic/experiential/design-oriented approach to DH. (Though the one that looks at quilts as a source for visual and stylistic analysis is very cool.) And I have a hunch that it’s not just me—that the disconnect from certain brands of digital methods felt by many researchers of my ilk (note that ilk is not gender) has more to do with the language being used for methodological and research-findings descriptions, and the intellectual orientation of the people doing the describing, than with the nature of, say, data mining itself. It’s easy to make a joke about imperialist and gendered undertones in the “digging in” rhetoric, but to some degree the advertising campaign for this program set the tone, for a broad and new community, of DH’s engagement with data mining. So that’s what I was after, when I raised the issue with an offhand comment or two online. Improved outreach to particular underrepresented groups is never a bad idea, but I’d prefer to see NEH and its funding partners (and individual DH centers and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations and our publications, etc.) start by becoming more thoughtful about the language we all use to describe and to signal data mining to a very broad community of researchers. After all, digital humanities nerds, we are still the minority in most of our departments, are we not? A little attention to audience and rhetoric can go a long way toward making applications and results of digital methods seem comprehensible, inspiring, and potentially transformative. Even to scholars who didn’t think digging and delving was their (dainty, fine-china) cup of tea. And there’s always this option—an idea, I assume, free for the taking: NOTE This chapter was originally published on April 7, 2011, at http://nowviskie.org/2011/what-do-girls-dig/ and http://storify.com/nowviskie/, first as an experiment in using the online Storify system, then in beta release.

Opinion | Just How White Is the Book Industry? - The New York Times;"By Richard Jean So and Gus WezerekDec. 11, 2020 During last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, books written by people of color climbed the best-seller lists. Was last summer a vision of equality to come for the publishing industry? Or a flash in the pan? 
Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah had just turned 26 when he got the call in 2017 that Mariner Books wanted to publish his short-story collection, “Friday Black.”
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah suspected that the contract he signed — a $10,000 advance for “Friday Black” and $40,000 for an unfinished second book — wasn’t ideal. But his father had cancer and the money provided a modicum of security.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah’s uneasiness over his book deal became more acute last summer. Using the hashtag #PublishingPaidMe, writers had begun to share their advances on Twitter with the goal of exposing racial pay disparities in publishing. Some white authors disclosed that they had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their debut books.
 

 

 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah wanted to share his contract. But he knew that doing so could make his publisher look bad and hurt his career. “It’s scary when it’s your life,” he said.
 
	Reticence gave way to action, though, when he thought about Jesmyn Ward’s tweet about how she “fought and fought” for a $100,000 advance, even after one of her novels won a National Book Award.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah started to type.
 
As #PublishingPaidMe spread online, more than a thousand people in the publishing industry signed up for a day of action to support the Black community.
 
	Publishing executives responded by releasing statements expressing support for racial justice, announcing antiracism training and promising to put out more books by writers of color. If they follow through, last summer’s activism could diversify the range of voices that American readers encounter for years to come.
 
	But measuring progress isn’t easy, and requires a baseline to compare against: How many current authors are people of color? As far as we could tell, that data didn’t exist.
 
	So we set out to collect it. First, we gathered a list of English-language fiction books published between 1950 and 2018. That list came from WorldCat, a global catalog of library collections. We wanted to focus on books that were widely read, so we limited our analysis to titles that were held by at least 10 libraries and for which we could find digital editions.
 
	We also constrained our search to books released by some of the most prolific publishing houses during the period of our analysis: Simon & Schuster, Penguin Random House, Doubleday (a major publisher before it merged with Random House in 1998), HarperCollins and Macmillan. After all that we were left with a dataset containing 8,004 books, written by 4,010 authors.
 
	To identify those authors’ races and ethnicities, we worked alongside three research assistants, reading through biographies, interviews and social media posts. Each author was reviewed independently by two researchers. If the team couldn’t come to an agreement about an author’s race, or there simply wasn’t enough information to feel confident, we omitted those authors’ books from our analysis. By the end, we had identified the race or ethnicity of 3,471 authors.
 
	We guessed that most of the authors would be white, but we were shocked by the extent of the inequality once we analyzed the data. Of the 7,124 books for which we identified the author’s race, 95 percent were written by white people.
 
	Author diversity at major publishing houses has increased in recent years, but white writers still dominate. Non-Hispanic white people account for 60 percent of the U.S. population; in 2018, they wrote 89 percent of the books in our sample.
 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 100% of fiction books published Just 11% of books in 2018 were written by people of color 89% were written by white writers 2010 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 
	This broad imbalance is likely linked to the people who work in publishing. The heads of the “big five” publishing houses (soon, perhaps, to become the “big four”) are white. So are 85 percent of the people who acquire and edit books, according to a 2019 survey.
 
	“There’s a correlation between the number of people of color who work in publishing and the number of books that are published by authors of color,” said Tracy Sherrod, the editorial director of Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins that is focused on Black literature.
 
	That correlation is visible in our data, exemplified by Toni Morrison’s career as an editor at Random House from 1967 to 1983. Random House’s first female Black editor, Ms. Morrison championed writers such as Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas and Gayl Jones. During her tenure, 3.3 percent of the 806 books published by Random House in our data were written by Black authors.
 
	The number of Black authors dropped sharply at Random House after Ms. Morrison left. Of the 512 books published by Random House between 1984 and 1990 in our data, just two were written by Black authors: Ms. Morrison’s “Beloved”  (through Knopf, which was owned by Random House) and “Sarah Phillips,” by Andrea Lee.
 
	(Random House published 12 books during this period by non-Black writers of color such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Michael Ondaatje, according to our data. In a response to our analysis, Random House pointed out that it was the longtime publisher of Maya Angelou, whose autobiography “All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes” was released in 1986; because it is a work of nonfiction, it is not included in our statistics.)
 
	In 1967, the same year that Ms. Morrison joined Random House, Marie Dutton Brown started as an intern at Doubleday and eventually rose to the rank of senior editor. Now a literary agent, Ms. Brown said that she witnessed how ephemeral gains for Black writers can be.
 
	“Black life and Black culture are rediscovered every 10 to 15 years,” said Ms. Brown. “Publishing reflects that.”
 
	Ms. Brown attributed the fluctuation in publishers’ support for Black writers to the news cycle, which periodically directs the nation’s attention to acts of brutality against Black people. Publishers’ interest in amplifying Black voices wanes as media coverage peters out because “many white editors are not exposed to Black life beyond the headlines,” Ms. Brown said.
 
	The lack of diversity among authors might be obscured by a small number of high-profile nonfiction books written by athletes, celebrities and politicians of color, according to Ms. Brown. “It gives the appearance that there are a lot of Black books published,” while publishers’ less famous “mid-list” authors are overwhelmingly white, she said.
 
	Literary prizes may also make publishing appear more diverse than it actually is. Over the past decade, more than half of the 10 most recent books that were awarded the National Book Award for fiction were written by people of color; Colson Whitehead has won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction twice in the past four years.
 
	Look at the books that appeared on The New York Times’s best-seller list for fiction, though, and a different picture emerges: Only 22 of the 220 books on the list this year were written by people of color.
 
	L.L. McKinney, an author of young-adult novels who started the #PublishingPaidMe hashtag, wasn’t surprised by the statistics on how few Black authors have been published relative to white authors.
 
	“I’ve heard things like, ‘We already have our Black girl book for the year,’” said Ms. McKinney. She also remembered comments suggesting books wouldn’t sell well if they had a Black person on the cover.
 
	In a 1950 essay titled “What White Publishers Won’t Print,” Zora Neale Hurston identified the chicken-or-egg dilemma at the heart of publishers’ conservatism. White people, she wrote, cannot conceive of Black people outside of racial stereotypes. And because publishers want to sell books, they publish stories that conform to those stereotypes, reinforcing white readers’ expectations and appetites.
 
	“It’s amusing to me when publishers say that they follow the market,” said Ms. McKinney. “They’re doing it because of tradition. And the tradition is racism.”
 
	Michael Strother, a former editor at Simon & Schuster, remembers the meeting in 2016 when he realized how limited his white colleagues’ imaginations were when it came to Black authors. Mr. Strother was trying to persuade executives to authorize a large bid for “The Hate U Give,” Angie Thomas’s young-adult novel about the fallout from a police shooting.
 
	Co-workers in the meeting praised the book; others teared up as they discussed its importance. “It was not only a good book, but a marketable book and an important book,” Mr. Strother said. “It should have been an easy yes.”
 
	Some of Mr. Strother’s white colleagues were hesitant, though. One asked, “Do we need Angie Thomas if we have Jason Reynolds?” (Mr. Reynolds is another Black author of young-adult novels.)
 
	“Their books are not similar at all except they both have Black characters,” said Mr. Strother, who is now a law student at New York University.
 
	Mr. Strother, whose account of the meeting was corroborated by one other person who was present, said he was authorized to bid far less than what he knew he would need to win the auction. Since it was published by Balzer + Bray, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 2017, “The Hate U Give” has spent 196 weeks on the Times young-adult best-seller list.
 
	Asked to comment on the acquisitions meeting, Simon & Schuster provided the following statement: “At Simon & Schuster Children’s Publishing, we are proud of our long and continuing history of publishing Black voices. While we typically do not comment on the acquisition process, each potential acquisition is considered based on its own merits. In 2016 we made a six-figure bid for Angie Thomas’s debut novel ‘The Hate U Give’ (plus a follow-up novel) in a heated auction between multiple publishers and the book eventually went to another publisher.”
 
A few days after Mr. Adjei-Brenyah tweeted his book deal, he received a message from his agent: Mariner Books wanted to restructure his contract and pay him “a lot more” for his second book.
 
	Mr. Adjei-Brenyah viewed his publisher’s reaction to his tweet as a small step toward dismantling decades of racism in publishing. “I’ve been growing into my courage,” he said. “Now I have to carry that energy forward.”
 
	A number of signs indicate that publishers are also carrying forward the energy from the summer’s protests.
 
	In October, Hachette Book Group announced the creation of Legacy Lit, one of several imprints started this year that are devoted to publishing books by writers of color. Krishan Trotman, who will lead the imprint, said she’s seen waves of support for Black authors come and go, but that Legacy Lit represents a real commitment to diversity by Hachette.
 
	“There will be a huge boom of books — all of a sudden Black women are hot or urban fiction is hot — and then there will be a backslide,” said Ms. Trotman. “That’s why we need these imprints. They’ll be here even after all the hoopla dies down.”
 
	Along with Dana Canedy at Simon & Schuster and Lisa Lucas at Pantheon and Schocken Books, Ms. Trotman is one of several Black women who were named to senior publishing jobs this year. Like Ms. Morrison 50 years ago, they may be able to clear the way for more writers of color to flourish.
 
	The bottom rungs of publishing are also a source of hope. When Ms. Brown started at Doubleday in 1967, she was the only Black intern in her year’s cohort. In 2019, almost half of all publishing interns identified as people of color.
 
	Whether those interns can grow into careers like Ms. Trotman’s or Ms. Brown’s will depend on publishers’ continued willingness to hire, promote and listen to people who they have historically sidelined. Our data suggests that progress toward diversity can be as short-lived as a single editor’s tenure.
 
	“The presence of Black editors is really important,” said Ms. Brown. “But you need more than one at the table.”
 Note: If a book had multiple authors and at least one of them was a person of color, we categorized the book as being by a person of color. Our analysis is limited by its focus on the best-known major publishers, omitting decades of important work by publishers such as Quinto Sol Publications and Broadside Press.

International Webinar Series on Interdisciplinary Perspectives of Digital Humanities | KIIT University News & Events;"KIIT University News & Events - KIIT Deemed to be University News

 International Webinar series on Interdisciplinary Perspectives of Digital Humanities was held on 20th February 2021. The Inaugural Ceremony was graced by Prof. Kalyani Samantaray, Professor & Head, Faculty of Arts, Communication & Indic Studies, Sri Sri University; Prof. Hrushikesha Mohanty, VC, KIIT; Prof. Sudarshan Nanda, Head CIR; and Prof. A. K. Sen, Chairman, UG Progamme and Dean-in-Charge, School of Humanities.   Speaking at the inaugural session, Prof. Kalyani Samantaray talked about the future of Digital Humanities in an explicit way. Prof. Hrushikesha Mohanty expressed happiness that the School of Humanities has been conducting a number of webinars and wished the trend to continue in the near future. Prof. Sudarshan Nanda emphasized on the need of organizing more webinars on the subject for the benefit of the research scholars. Prof. A. K. Sen talked about the technical aspects of the Digital Humanities. Dr. Deepanjali Mishra, Convenor and Dr. Sukanta Chandra Swain, Associate Dean, School of Humanities also spoke on the occasion. At the first technical session, Dr. Nandini C. Sen, Associate Professor, Delhi University spoke on the topic, ‘Post colonialism, Gender and Digital Humanities’. She explained the meaning, scope, tool and techniques of Digital Humanities, while pointing out the existing digital divide and gender divide in today’s era. She also raised her concern about fake information and cyber crimes and suggested all the participants read ‘Things Fall Apart’. Ms. Sugyanta Priyadarshini, Faculty, School of Humanities moderated the session. At the second technical session, Dr. Liang Lao, Associate Professor Department of Modern & Classical Languages and Literature and Cultures, University of Kentucky, USA began her talk with the legendary Chinese story, ‘The white Snake’. She made a comparison to the snake that takes the form of a lady and tries to live as a human (but fails). She then spoke about ‘Alice in the Pandemic’ where the female protagonist playing the role of a nurse poignantly portrays about her mental and physical constraints. Dr. Lao concluded her talk with a short 8 minute video of Indrani Pal titled ‘Lady White Snake’, which is an amalgamation of eastern concept of snake spirit with western version of vampire.

Introducing Emily | Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP);"Hi Emily! Can you please tell us a bit about your career trajectory so far? It’s been something of a wandering trajectory! I completed my BA in History and English at Monash University in 2002, returning to Monash for Honours in History in 2005, and on to Melbourne for my PhD in 2007, looking at Australia and the United States during the development of Australian federation, which I finished in 2018. At the same time I worked in different call centres, including at Yarra City Council, and eventually was able to move into the role of Community Grants Administrator there in 2012. I also was able to take up some different research and teaching related roles in this time, including a summer internship at the Library of Congress in Washington, and as an intern with The University of Melbourne’s Digital Studio where I worked with fellow MDAPer, Aleks (Dr. Aleks Michalewicz). While studying I became increasingly interested in the digital humanities and the possibilities available for researchers there, and after finishing my thesis started learning different programming languages, which ultimately led to me starting my dream job with MDAP in February 2020. Tell us about an interesting project at MDAP? I’m just diving into a new collaboration that I am very excited about. The MDAP team is working with Prof. Julie Willis and Soon-Tzu Speechley in the Australian Centre for Architectural History, Urban and Cultural Heritage. They have been doing interesting work looking at architectural history in a new way, and we will be collaborating to visualise the data they have, to show how architects moved and worked within and across the British Empire in the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. What are some of the solvable, difficult, and wicked problems on your horizon? I think the ever present problem is keeping on top of the different tools and techniques for data analysis, and knowing or working out which is the best option for any given situation. On the plus side, this means I’m constantly learning new things, which is the way I like to be. Can you tell us about your latest adventure or next planned one outside of MDAP? My last big adventure was travelling around the United States for a month after I finished my thesis. I was able to visit friends in Dallas, Boston, Baltimore, Washington and Atlanta; be a tourist in Los Angeles; meet an old family friend in Chicago to go and see Hamilton, and spend a week in a mansion on the outer banks of North Carolina blues dancing. It was magical! In the context of a rapidly evolving global environment and UoM’s research strategy, what would you most like to explore, challenge, or innovate in your work in the future? I’m also looking forward to working more in less familiar domains, and with different members of the MDAP team, expanding my skills and experience and contributing my humanities background to all sorts of projects.   — Lead image: Emily seeing Hamilton in Chicago in 2018.

(Student Voices) The Topography of Data: Visualizing NEH Grants | Humanities for All;"(Student Voices) The Topography of Data: Visualizing NEH Grants Screenshot of the interactive map the students created in ArcGIS. This is the first of two blog posts written by graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). In Fall 2020, the National Humanities Alliance partnered with a digital humanities course on three semester-long projects that the students worked on in groups. In this post, Ben Williams describes his experience working as part of the group tasked with creating a map of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grants with a congressional district overlay for the NHA’s NEH for All initiative. This map combines several data sets into one visually accessible map and is an invaluable resource in highlighting the widespread impact of the NEH.  -- While enrolled in English 76-829, an introductory course to digital humanities at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 2020, our class collaborated with the National Humanities Alliance (NHA) on three digital humanities projects. My group’s task seemed simple: build a comprehensive map with a congressional district overlay that could communicate the impact of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant funding throughout the United States. In other words, we were asked to make the geographically widespread impact of the NEH more visually accessible for advocates. Our project was seemingly objective and its visual representation obvious, but over time we found ourselves having to continually reassess how we mapped data.  When we map, code, or quantify as humanists, questions arise about how power asymmetries might determine who or what counts. We thought deeply about not just the spatial spread of our data, but what I consider its topography. That is, the data’s layers built on humanistic contexts: robust stories, archived documents, and searchable details. Grants for exhibitions like “Picturing the Past” or “Adios Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950” were condensed to titles, geocodes, and program types. We knew little about their layered histories including their inception, implementation, and reception. Even within this relatively small data set, I was reminded of the need for what Tricia Wang calls “thick data,” 1
 which, with gesture toward Clifford Geertz’s notion of “thick description,” 2
 seeks to reveal “the social context of and connections between data points,” not just the “insights within a particular range of data points.” But to transform our data into thick data, we needed broad frames and minute details that might reveal the character of each of the data-funded grants, projects, and institutions captured in those Excel sheets and mitigate the issues of representation that come from staid data points.  We first had to sift through a surfeit of information about funding. And if there’s one thing I learned from looking at the collection of Excel sheets sent to us, it is that data overwhelms, and immense data overwhelms immensely. I found myself feeling adrift and incapable of contextualizing the information provided: unfamiliar names, unpredictably titled institutions, grants referred to by proxies or discrepant identifiers. Making sense of it required some investment in researching each of the programs in our data set. For example, we looked extensively at websites related to the “Muslim Journeys Bookshelf,” a collaboration between the American Library Association (ALA) and the NEH that provides public audiences in the U.S. with accessible and trustworthy materials related to Islam and Islamic civilizations. Rather than just seeing the geographic reach of the funding associated with this project, I started to understand the material and cultural impact of providing archival documents, books, films, and other programming resources to create space for audiences to become more familiar with people, places, history, faith, and cultures of Muslims around the world and in the US. Across testimonials, there was spirited reflection on the significance and positive reception of the content and materials from institutions and communities who now housed the bookshelf. Working through these details underscored the ways that feelings, thoughts, and reactions are often veiled by numeric data. Through this additional research, the data started to become more humanistic and helped us see what and who we were trying to map. Eventually, with ArcGIS, a mapping software, the data’s topography was rendered over a spattering of colorful dots on the US with outlines of congressional districts. However, we found that as the data points were placed on the map, there were areas with dramatic absences, making the map appear partisan. While data points were sparse in red states and rural spaces, blue states and urban areas were filled with them. We determined that including data from Chronicling America, an NEH-sponsored repository of historic US newspaper information, would help visualize the reach of the NEH more evenly at different scales on the map. But the data was sent as a text file, which came with its own set of issues. Columns were indistinct and locations were hidden in parentheticals that made mapping difficult. Chris Warren, our digital humanities instructor, sifted through the data and used Pandas to compile it into a readable and, most importantly, usable form. Once put into ArcGIS, we saw the fruits of our labor scattered throughout the map, filling in the blank spots and underscoring the NEH-funded projects’ truer geographic distribution. We were given the code used to turn the text file of Chronicling America into something we could put on our map, and in this moment, I was reminded of how digital humanities works. It’s about templates of knowledge. Python, Regular Expressions, and Pandas are all useful tools and modes of knowledge that are easily transferable, and by availing ourselves  to the code, we can put it to work when we encounter similar issues with messy data sets. So perhaps to revise an earlier comment, data does overwhelm, but less immensely when you have a template to help clean it.   Benjamin Williams is a Ph.D. student in Literary and Cultural Studies at Carnegie Mellon University. His research centers on how border rhetorics in literature, photography, and law construct conceptions of race, nation, and gender in the United States. He has presented his work examining migrant literature and visual culture at several conferences, including those hosted by Philosophy of the City, Comparative Drama, Northeast Modern Language Association (NeMLA), and Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS).

Alumna lends expertise to Georgetown slavery archive project - Georgetown Today;In conjunction with Michigan State University and the University of Virginia, Georgetown is continuing its commitment to slavery reconciliation by expanding access to these institutions’ slavery-related archive material through the “On These Grounds” project. This collaborative initiative will implement a novel approach to connecting thousands of archival items across the universities, including letters and bills of sale. In addition, the linked-data approach will use context and events as guides to paint a more comprehensive view of the lived histories and backgrounds of the enslaved communities at these institutions. “On These Grounds” is financially supported by gifts from alumni and a $550,000 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which has funded other archival and digital humanities efforts across the three universities. While colleges and universities have distinct approaches to examining and interpreting their individual histories as slavery-complicit institutions, Dean of Georgetown University Library Harriette Hemmasi says that the project’s methodology will enable a broader understanding of the similarities and differences in these shared histories. With its focus on events recorded in the archives, the project will enhance the ability of scholars and the public to access and analyze these historical records and will allow descendants of those enslaved to gain a more dynamic picture of their ancestors’ lives. “The most important part of this project is that we are opening and connecting the archives in ways never before possible,” Hemmasi says. “In the past, we looked at each archive as if it were a separate, unique entity. With this model, however, researchers and the public will have the ability to examine and compare a wide range of archives to reconstruct a more comprehensive history, while also being able to delve more deeply into individual records. As the archives are allowed to speak, they will tell us the stories that shaped not only the lives of our institutions but, more importantly, the lives of those enslaved at our institutions,” Hemmasi adds. Sharon Leon (C’97), associate professor of history and digital humanities at Michigan State, birthed the idea for “On These Grounds” and now serves as the project director. As an American Studies major, Leon learned to examine critical questions about American culture and heritage. Her role in this project connects to her first encounters with Georgetown’s slavery archives during her sophomore year, when she “worked with primary sources from archival materials related to the Maryland Province Jesuits” as part of a digital humanities project she and her fellow American Studies students conducted. “In existing scholarship, the scope is really about the Jesuits and why they did what they did. Now it’s our job to expand that lens and find out as much as we can about the enslaved community, about their families, and about the conditions in which they lived,” says Leon. Thus far, Leon has researched about 1,200 individuals living between 1717 and 1838, including Henny, who was a midwife and George and Flora, who lost three of their six children in one year due to a smallpox outbreak in the early 1790s. Beyond her expertise in digital humanities, Leon says she feels obligated to take on this project because of her family’s legacy as Georgetown alumni. “My father not only attended and worked at Georgetown, but my father’s family was from colonial Southern Maryland,” Leon says. “So I’m certain that my father’s family was on the ground with the very enslaved people I’m learning about.” Hemmasi and Leon emphasize that the work to learn more about the enslaved communities at Georgetown falls on the shoulders of the entire university community. “Grappling with the history of slavery at colleges and universities is a contemporary issue. These institutions multiplied access to privileged white people and limited equitable access to the descendants of the enslaved in a way that has had lasting consequences,” Leon says. “Therefore, this is everybody’s problem, but especially my problem as an alumna. My family didn’t pay tuition, but this work is my tuition. This is my ongoing debt.” At 6 feet, 10 inches tall, Coach John Thompson Jr.—affectionately known as “Big John”—stood above many as an athlete, pioneering NCAA coach, architect of the Big East, three-time Olympian, and… Above: Aline de Souza, M.D., (left) and Xie Wu (right) do RNA prep for ACE2 studies led by Hong Ji, M.D. When the pandemic began widening in March 2020, Georgetown… The Crown Heights community is made up of mostly low-income families of color.

Digital Humanities Day |;Thank you for attending DH Day 2021! You can watch the event recordings here. What does it mean to study the humanities? What can you do with an arts/humanities degree? Every year, there are articles lamenting the decline of the humanities and the dire prospects that arts and humanities majors face. The impacts of COVID-19 on educational institutions and the workplace have reignited the same old question: Who needs the humanities?  Digital Humanities Day 2021 will explore the value of the humanities in the current moment. Through panel discussions with UW students and alumni from the arts, humanities, and social sciences, we hope students will leave inspired to explore different possibilities for their future, and get an idea of what working in the humanities looks like in a variety of fields.;https://www.centerfornonprofitexcellence.org/jobs/digital-humanities-intern;
Inventing the Digital Humanities through Freirian Praxis:  Folding-Unfolding-Refolding;"“[W]hat is broken and twisted is also beautiful, and a bearer of knowledge. The Deformed Humanities is an origami crane—a piece of paper contorted into an object of startling insight and beauty.” Mark Sample The Digital Humanities are actively being invented in this very moment. They have not taken shape as a concrete thing, but evolve as an ongoing and collaborative process still taking shape. This can be seen in how the Digital Humanities are being negotiated as a debate between building and breaking. What’s being built: word clouds, wikis, blogs, maps, games, comics, prezis, films, crowdsourced articles, MOOCs, curated social media stories, and greater access.  What’s being broken: traditional pedagogy, poems, images, borders, and potentially even the law. While this has been the dominant narrative, I want to propose a counter narrative where transformation and invention occur not through the building or breaking binary, but rather as a result of folding, unfolding, and refolding. This origami metaphor, I think, aligns with Freirian Praxis as a process of “engaging in a cycle of theory, application, evaluation, reflection, and then back to theory.” The need to develop this counter narrative was apparent after co-teaching an upper level English course. The course had two distinct instructor personas — a luddite and a cyborg — and we were on the path to creating another iteration of the dissonant building and breaking narrative. My assignments allowed students to build digital and multimodal artifacts. The other instructor urged students to break down texts from critically informed perspectives. However, by folding these two personal pedagogical approaches together, we were able to collaboratively realize Freirean praxis as a cycle of theory-practice-theory. Such an understanding of praxis encourages us to question assumed knowledge, challenge habits of mind, and oppose unreasonable prejudices. This folding counter narrative not only invigorates the collaborative power of praxis, but it can also help to advance the ongoing invention of the Digital Humanities in more meaningful ways. My first semester co-teaching was representative of the building and breaking narrative. My assignments asked students to build their own digital artifact using images, paintings, audio, and printed texts. It was a creative form of curation where students formed their own arguments through multiple modes of electronic production. My colleague relied more strictly on textual criticism, analysis, and interpretation through an elaborate process of close-reading. So while I had students digitally build things, my colleague had them break down texts. As someone who happily wore the title of a luddite, my colleague openly expressed his list of grievances with texting, Facebook, Twitter, as well as what he considered ten thousand other digital distractions. I struggled to convince him that these things might help to further the humanities in the 21st century while he struggled to convince me that the old methods couldn’t be strengthened by digital intervention. The result was a class divided. After our first semester co-teaching, my colleague and I reflected on the negative implications of reinforcing the building and breaking narrative. While both of our teaching traditions were beneficial in their own right, the stylistic divide between my colleague and I resulted in a weakened classroom foundation. Many students felt that literary criticism mars the original artwork, but my colleague found that criticism as a practice actually helps to build something new. In a similar phenomenon, despite the fact that students were building digital and multimodal artifacts, I found that they were simultaneously performing an act of criticism. As a whole, during our post-class reflection we discussed how we might combine our perspectives through more transformative practices. How could we coalesce our two methods to create an even stronger classroom pedagogy? From this discussion, we set out to fuse these aspects of building and breaking into one assignment. A year after my initial co-teaching experience, the digital and analog humanities began to fold together through an assignment that employed the metaphor of origami. Students integrated the primary text of a novel and film alongside various interviews, reviews, and criticisms centered around these primary texts; they used numerous critical angles provided by literary and film critics in order to create a situated multimodal and digital practice. The goal was to demonstrate that literary critics could use word clouds, popular memes, YouTube videos, podcasts, blogs, timelines, comics, and websites to visualize their data and research. At the same time, I wanted to demonstrate how digital practices might integrate close-reading strategies as well as more traditional modes of literary criticism, analysis, and the array of other rhetorical affordances akin to print literacy. In short, the assignment was successful because it fused together our once divergent views of the humanities. The spirit behind this collaboration corresponds with the tenets of “serious play,” which Robin Wharton models after how “Children learn — to communicate, to use tools, to count — by playing. Curricula in many early childhood educational settings are designed around this basic principle.” As a concept, “play” not only aided in the creation of the previous assignment, but when taken as a mindstate it can also help to unite the digital and analog humanities on one integral path. The collaborative process inherent to many forms of play allowed our digital and analog classroom practices to work together not as thesis and antithesis, but as two equally valuable processes that benefited from being folded together. One does not necessarily need to build digital artifacts to take part in the invention of the Digital Humanities. It’s also not necessary to break apart the entirety of traditional pedagogy. Freirian praxis tells us that there is action in critical reflection. In other words, invention can mean following our classroom practice with critical reflection, which can help to further inform subsequent actions. This awareness is at the heart of the folding-unfolding-refolding counter narrative. I am advocating for an approach that intertwines personal experience alongside collective or collaborative invention, particularly as it relates to the Digital Humanities. Freirian praxis defines the personal as systemic, and by generalizing from the personal we are enacting the folding-unfolding-refolding dialectic. Stated a different way, by questioning the motivation behind personal classroom practices, whether we profess to be cyborgs or luddites, those aspects of our teaching that normally go unquestioned can work to inform the ongoing invention and evolution of the humanities. Adeline Koh concurs with this sentiment when she says, “You are already a digital humanist, whether or not you know it.” Our contemporary human experience is mediated by digital technologies, and therefore to study the humanities is necessarily to study the Digital Humanities. I would like to end by evoking the concept of the “unfolded fold,” which Henri Michaux writes about in his poetic musing, “In the Land of Magic” (1941). Michaux speaks of educated people, or “mages,” who see between the folds not as a result of some unobtainable or esoteric knowledge, but from practically interacting with the world in unfamiliar ways. In this context, inventing the Digital Humanities might benefit not merely from implementing new tools and techniques (i.e. esoteric knowledge), but more simply from seeing our pedagogy in new and unfamiliar ways. Similar to how a piece of paper can be “contorted into an object of startling insight and beauty,” so too does this practice take the well known elements of the Digital Humanities and fold them into something new.

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. Through machine learning, researchers do not hardcode programs to perform tasks, rather they allow a computer to generate its own rules to perform these tasks. This is achieved via various methods of training. While machine learning has its conceptual incipience in the 1960s, it did not receive much public attention until the early 2010s. Over the past five years, the methods and applications of machine learning has grown substantially, while the resources for implementing machine learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and FastAI, have made it much more accessible. Despite this accessibility a large gap remains. This gap exists in two forms: conceptual understanding of machine learning and knowledge of programming. This presentation focuses on the former by providing digital humanists a basic introduction to machine learning while presuming no knowledge of mathematics or programming. The presentation will address popular misconceptions about artificial intelligence, explain the fundamental concepts and terminology of machine learning, and conclude with an explanation of the resources available to humanists for getting started. The goal of this presentation is, therefore, to provide viewers with a starting point for exploring machine learning and its potential application to their projects. William Mattingly is a Postdoctoral Fellow for the Analysis of Historical Texts at the Smithsonian Institution Data Science Lab in collaboration with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). His research has focused on developing text classification neural network models to identify sources in medieval texts. He is also developing named entity recognition (NER) models for ancient and medieval languages, such as Latin (Classical and Medieval), Ancient Greek, Old English, Old Norse, and Old High German. At the Smithsonian and USHMM, he is developing machine learning methods to aid, in among other things, a pipeline for automatically processing and catag hundreds of millions of Holocaust documents. He is co-investigator and lead developer for The Bitter Aloe Project project (https://www.rch.uky.edu/project_bitteraloe.html) and lead investigator and developer for the Digital Alcuin Project. He has a B.A. and M.A. in History from Florida Gulf Coast University and a Ph.D. in History from the University of Kentucky. His dissertation research explored using historical social network analysis, cluster analysis, and computational methods for identifying ninth-century intellectual and pedagogical networks. --10:00-10:50am-- ""Introduction to Python and its Research Applications in the Humanities""
What is Python, and why should humanists want to use it? Which digital humanities methods can Python be used for? And what are the first steps for a new Python-user to get started? This presentation, geared towards beginners, will address what Python is and how it can be used for specific research applications in the digital humanities (statistics, text mining, network analysis). The presentation will guide prospective users in the installation, first steps, and basic applications of these research tools, expecting no prior experience in programming or statistics. Specifically, after motivating the use of Python through its many applications, we will examine the installation process through the Anaconda distribution. We will then elucidate the differences between Python’s editor and markdown environments (Jupyter Notebook and Spyder), and then delineate the conceptual logic underlying Python through an introduction to object types (and the methods attached to them) and Python libraries (numpy, Pandas). We will combine what we’ve learned in a research application example to conclude the presentation. My hope is that participants walk away with the feeling that they know where to start if they want to pursue Python further, and that they will want to do so! Daniella Gáti (any pronouns) is a digital humanist, and scholar of contemporary literature, media, and digital culture. Their current work examines the relationship between social media forms of anti-racist and queer protest and contemporary dissent fiction. He is also developing a coauthored project with an economist that investigates how sentiment analysis of novels can be used to extract valuable information about society’s beliefs about its long-term economic prospects. Daniella received her Ph.D. in English from Brandeis University, an MA in English from the University of Bern, Switzerland, and an MA and BA in Economics, also from Bern. Her dissertation examines the vignette as a counterhegemonic representational form in and around the book in contemporary print and digital fiction, as well as in a book historical dimension. --11:00-11:50am-- “Advanced Features of Scalar”
Scalar an open source publishing platform available to the UIC community through Digital UIC (digital.uic.edu). It is designed to make it easy for authors to write and publish long-form digital scholarship. Scalar also allows users to assemble media from multiple sources such as YouTube and the Digital Public Library of America and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required. This presentation will cover the basics of creating a Scalar site and then move on to demonstrating the more advanced features available in Scalar. These more advanced features include annotation tools, collaboration and editorial tools, and built-in visualizations. Janet Swatscheno is the Digital Publishing Librarian at the University of Illinois at Chicago Library. Before joining UIC, she was the Digital Publishing Specialist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Library of Congress Junior Fellow at the John W.

Possibilities for Digital Humanities at Community Colleges | Digital Scholarship in the Humanities;"I was pleased to present today at Houston Community College’s Spring 2019 English & Humanities Colloquium on “The Digital Classroom: Humanities, Literature & Composition.” Thanks to Dr. Helen Graham for the invitation. Here are my slides. Much of the presentation is built on Dr. Anne McGrail’s work on DH and community colleges. Anne McGrail authored our keyword, Community College, for Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities! Wonderful work! https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/community_college.md I am an English faculty member at Eastfield College in the Dallas, Texas, area. We have been trying to get our digital humanities (now digital scholarship to bring in all disciplines) program off the ground for about three years. The hardest part is convincing other faculty to jump in. As the chair of the DS committee, I have been trying to find the best ways to put together a kind of flow chart for our program, to manage program goals, and to encourage faculty to incorporate DS tools, creativity, projects into their pedagogy and assignments. I am looking for more training if you have any suggestions, I would love them! I’d take a look at Anne McGrail’s materials on doing DH in a community college context, e.g. https://blogs.lanecc.edu/dhatthecc/  You might also see if there are any area THATCamps (although I don’t see any scheduled in Texas).

What jobs can you get with a master's degree in Digital Humanities?;Back to News Home We have many flexible accelerated and graduate degrees available online. Fill out this form to get more information.  Do you have a story idea or media inquiry for Concordia’s Strategic Communications team? Send an email to news@cuaa.edu. Digital humanities is a growing field, but what jobs can you get with this degree? If you love the humanities, but are unsure about what jobs are out there, you might be surprised by the amount of opportunities.   The digital humanities incorporate a variety of fields of study, such as history, theology, philosophy, English, to name a few. The digital aspect of the digital humanities requires students to use and design digital tools. Dr. Erin Laverick, Program Director for Concordia University’s M.A. in Digital Humanities, states: “These tools allow people to research and explore ethical, social, and religious issues relevant to local and global communities.” Working in the digital humanities is truly interdisciplinary. Digital humanities could be a great fit for you if you are passionate about a certain content area, but also want to have a relevant skillset. It’s true that there are a lot of bootcamps and courses out there that could help you achieve some of the skills you might want. But, a master’s degree unlocks more opportunities for you. One key benefit to a master’s degree is the potential for a higher salary. While bootcamps and quick courses can be useful, they often lack the depth and time required to learn a subject well. Earning your master’s in Digital Humanities tells your future employer that you took a deep dive into robust course content and research. Plus, each of your professors is an expert in their field, so you can be sure you’re learning from the best.   The sky is your limit with a Master’s in Digital Humanities. These are just a few examples of jobs you can get. This specific role can be as broad or as specific as it needs to be. Some of your responsibilities include project management, managing digital archives, and developing workshops. You’ll need to stay current with technological trends and data science. Oftentimes, libraries need a Digital Humanities Specialist.    If you’d like to hone your problem-solving skills in a creative way, you should consider web design. Betterteam states that proficiency in web languages and digital tools is essential for this role. Additionally, having a background in the digital humanities will prepare you to implement what you create. Web design is all about working with people to develop a concept that is then displayed on the web. Some other non-negotiable skills are: The digital world we live in demands strategic, critical thinking and creative problem solving, especially around digital content and media. Many organizations need an expert in both communications and digital tools. Betterteam describes the role of Digital Communications specialist this way:   Fred Beecher, Director of UX at The Nerdery, explains what UX designers do like this: “The short version is that…I humanize technology.” Career Foundry listed these essential tasks for UX designers: Truity describes an archives librarian as one who “preserves important or historically significant documents and records.” The day-to-day role depends on the organization, but here are some essential tasks of the job: Truity differentiates a curator from an archivist this way: “Curators lead the acquisition, storage, and exhibition of collections.” Oftentimes, they have to negotiate the sale and acquisition of artifacts. Here are some other responsibilities: One of the cool things about studying digital humanities is that you can pursue your passion while still honing your job skills. Michelle Obama once stated that the humanities define who we are as a people. We would be honored to walk alongside you in your journey toward a greater understanding of what it means to be human in a digital world.

Scholars as Bricoleurs: The Plurality of Digital Humanities | C2DH | Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History;"While theoretical debates about the role of digital scholarship in the humanities abound, comprehensive empirical studies are relatively rare. This talk will probe digital humanities (DH) from an empirical perspective, discussing findings of an ethnographic study of 250 scholars described in the presenter’s book “Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production."" We will first look at how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies in their research workflows, focusing on scholars’ practices, needs, and challenges at different stages of the research lifecycle—from collecting and analyzing research data, to sharing and archiving research outputs. We will then examine how humanists’ digital scholarship emerges spontaneously, based on specific research or teaching needs, and, once so adopted, interacts with scholars’ research practices as a subjective process of knowledge production. In a bricolage manner, humanists construct their digital workflows from a diverse range of tools and methods suited to their preferences and needs, engaging with digital technologies in an unscripted and highly personal way that corresponds to their style of thinking and working, to their intimate epistemology. The “unruly” approach of bricolage may be outside the boundary of most DH theory, yet it is important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and engage with this variety of voices and non-canonical technology uses, paving the way for the pluralistic future of digital knowledge production in the humanities.  Dr. Smiljana Antonijević explores the intersection of communication, culture, and technology through research and teaching in the USA and Europe. She is the author of Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production (2015), while her other recent publications focus on ethnography of DH coding (2020), data ethnography (2019), Internet and trust (2019), humanists’ digital workflows (2018), and others. In addition to academic work, Smiljana is engaged in applied research in Silicon Valley, focusing on artificial intelligence, intelligent automation, and digital security.     This event is part of ""New Horizons: Confronting the Digital Turn in the Humanities"", a lecture series organised by the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).      With the kind support of

Research in times of COVID – Digital Humanities Lab;"Digital Humanities Lab Leibniz-Institut für Europäische Geschichte by Jaap Geraerts COVID-19 has posed a challenge, to put it mildly, to how most of us go about living our lives. Either in our personal life or work life, most if not all of us had to make significant adaptions in order to deal with a world that still is in the grasp of pandemic. The experience I’d like to focus on in this blog post, is that of doing research at these unprecedented times. Fairly soon after COVID-19 broke out, it became clear that it would have huge implications for researchers and teachers. Due to travel bans and other restrictions, virtually all conferences were either canceled or were held online in some form or another. In a short time span, teachers across the world had to go to extraordinary lengths to move their courses online. As libraries and archives closed their doors and traveling to or from particular countries became severely restricted or even impossible, the access to primary and secondary sources, the very fuel of our research, was hampered to a large degree.  My own experiences chime with this general picture. All the conferences I was supposed to attend were canceled and the research trip to the Netherlands that I had planned for the last week of May had to be postponed. Luckily I could work on other aspects of my current research project and spent a couple of months doing boring but necessary work on the data set that I’m preparing, work for which I rely on online databases such as this one. Finally, because most Dutch archives and libraries started opened their doors from the beginning of June and the international trains from Germany to my home country resumed their service as well, I was  able to embark on a three-week research trip in August. I certainly wasn’t able to visit all the places I originally intended. For example, the limited number of seats offered by the Dutch National Archive were already reserved long in advanced of my trip. Nor could I consult the collections of the University Library in Utrecht since it only catered for the staff and students of the university. Apart from that, however, I managed to visit a surprising amount of provincial, regional, and local archives. These were gradually opened to the public again on the condition that everyone strictly adhered to the safety measures. At Het Utrechts Archief visitors were welcomed by a large poster detailing a set of clear instructions (see image 1), while the larger reading room of the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem was equipped with a set of colourful walk lines. In both archives, plastic screens separated members of staff from visitors and made safe communication between them possible. These buildings were equipped with hand sanitizing stations as well, although in Haarlem I was told that before touching the manuscript material we actually needed to wash our hands again with normal soap (it turns out that most hand sanitizers are rather bad for the archival documents). Although operating on restricted schedules, which translated into limited opening hours and a lower number of documents one could request on a daily basis, it turned out to be possible to get a lot of research done. This should be contributed entirely to the willingness of members of staff to go beyond what they were required to do, mainly by fetching more documents than their own guidelines stipulated. Indeed, somehow archivists and librarians managed to outdo their already high levels of service that we are so accustomed to in normal times. Their dedication does not stand in isolation. Since the outbreak of the virus we have witnessed a veritable outpouring of acts of kindness among the academic community, including sharing teaching materials, offering workshops and seminar on how to teach online, and providing access to primary and secondary sources. At the same time such heart-warming acts of generosity and support – academia at its very best – contrast sharply with the economic and politic realities we face. Already before the pandemic the state of academia in many countries was rather deplorable and its future looks even more grim due to the economic and political implications of the virus. In some case the deteriorating financial situation of universities has already resulted in the large-scale sacking of staff. It’s hard to believe, but the academic job market is likely to become even worse in the foreseeable future, further swelling the ranks of the academic precariat. Alas, the cultural sector cannot expect a much brighter future, with national stimulus packages being largely diverted to other sectors. So torn between the experience of solidarity and kindness one the one hand, and the harsh political and economic realities on the other, it is not easy to make sense of this period. Still, for me there is one major takeaway from all of this: the importance of community and collaboration. In a time when the academic and cultural sectors in many countries are the victim of an astonishing lack of political will to properly fund them (if not under direct attack from (alt-right) political parties), doing research during COVID provided yet another reminder that most of the academic activities that we are engaged in are fundamental communal in nature and are simply impossible without the existence of and access to a variety of well-staffed institutions, including archives, libraries, and universities. Hopefully the importance of the sciences and humanities in dealing with the virus and addressing its many cultural, economic, and social implications, will convince the powers that be that investing in the people and institutions that underpin and enable academic research and teaching is perhaps not such a bad idea after all.

Digital Access, Inclusion, and the Humanities | School of Advanced Study;"Convenors: Dr Naomi Wells, Early Career Researcher in Italian and Spanish with Digital Humanities, Institute of Modern Languages Research, School of Advanced Study and Professor Jane Winters, Professor of Digital Humanities, School of Advanced Study Across the world in 2020, the Covid-19 crisis led to the closure of the physical spaces where people engage in and with humanities research. University buildings, libraries, museums and archives were shuttered for more than a third of the year in the UK, and have only gradually been able to welcome back staff, students and visitors. Even twenty years ago, the impact of the pandemic on our ability to conduct research, to collaborate, to access cultural heritage and to share knowledge would have been devastating. Today, we have the web, social media, digitised collections of documents and objects, video and audio conferencing, online classrooms and MOOCs. All of these tools and more have been deployed to allow people to access from home the best that the humanities have to offer.   
But how equal is this access? How many children have been disadvantaged because they do not have their own computer or a reliable internet connection? How many of the university students learning and researching from home or in halls of residence have been able to consult the digitised collections that they need? Who has decided what does and does not warrant digitisation, and how much access to digitised material will cost? What is the impact of copyright, IPR and legal deposit legislation on people’s ability to work with digital sources? How evenly are the disadvantages and opportunities spread across different groups in society, and between different nations?

This conversation will explore the enormous value of digital tools and platforms in enabling, promoting and developing the humanities at a time of crisis, but it will also consider how the humanities can help us to examine the challenges and pitfalls of the digital.

Taking a walk (or a stroll?) through digital humanities – Digital History Methods;"Digital History Methods HIST 477/677 American University This may be an odd question, but how would you describe the way that you walk or move around in the world? Do you hold a certain posture? Does it depend on the people, places, and things surrounding you? According to Joanna Guldi, the way a person’s style of walking is described can carry a lot of contextual and cultural information, especially in London during the 19th century. Guldi used databases and keyword variants to research the cultural change through walking habits in her article “The History of Walking and the Digital Turn.” Making use of Google Book Search, The Making of the Modern World (MMW) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) databases, she explored the shifting terminology to reveal the changing discourse of walking in 19th century London. Guldi noticed expressions such as “lurching,” “dodging,” and “waddling” grew in popularity over time. She also observed a contrast between the use of the words “lounge” and “stride” that reflected “the struggle between aristocratic and middle-class views of city, strangers, and the body.” On the other hand, the word “slodge” appeared in 1829 to describe “a drunken, foot-dragging walk, with all the poverty and dissolution such a posture could imply.” After examining the change of language over time through digital tools, Guldi asks other historians to establish new methodologies to glean additional information from digital database resources. Did Guldi’s methods change the way that you view historical texts? Continuing the conversation of “big data” that we started last week, have you come across historians incorporating similar methods in their research? Ben Schmidt, who is currently the Director of Digital Humanities at New York University, also enjoyed experimenting with digital analysis tools. For one of his projects, he used Google Ngram to investigate the extent of anachronistic language in the popular British historical drama Downton Abbey. In his blog post “Making Downton more traditional,” shared his process of checking every single line of the show’s script for historical accuracy by running every two-word phrase through the Google Ngram database. (For a great overview of Google Ngram, check out Rosie’s blog post!) Schmidt gave a list of 34 anachronistic phrases that appeared in season 3 of the show. I have never seen Downton Abbey, and I was surprised to see the phrase “unicorn if” on the list. Schmidt also found that every episode included dozens of phrases following speech patterns that were more consistent with teenagers’ language during the 1990s than the characters in the show. The characters’ phrasing was not the only anachronistic aspect of the show. Schmidt acknowledged that “the sensibilities are obviously modern, easy for us to understand, and false to the reality of the past.” A couple of the commenters also discussed the show’s use of contemporary phrases to create a historical drama that appealed to modern audiences. (This may be an aside from the main analysis of the readings, but do you agree with the commenters? What is the balance between historical accuracy and appealing to contemporary audiences?) Guldi’s and Schmidt’s use of text databases and digital analysis tools demonstrate a facet of digital humanities’ many capabilities.  In the article “Digital visualization as a scholarly activity,” Martyn Jessop shares a variety of methods for visualizing information through images, diagrams, and animations to communicate messages. Visualization is not only a method for viewing information, but also a method for studying information. This includes examining spatial relationships, quantitative analysis, temporal relationships, and 3D visualizations of built environments. Are there some forms of data visualization that work better than others? Additionally,  Jessop claims that digital visualization’s greatest value is “not for analysis, but for synthesis and modelling.” Do you agree with Jessop’s assertion? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Mia, I think it can be appropriate to mix contemporary language in historical shows to make it more relatable. It helps viewers connect, but it has to be done well and the emphasis still has to be on presenting the information.  As far as data visualization it is an important tool that again can help viewers connect to the information. For me, it is much easier to see a space drawn out than see numbers listed. I do agree that it is great for synthesis and modeling but it can be useful for analysis as well. Some people are visual learners and understand better through visualization rather than numbers or words. Hi Amanda!  I think I usually feel the same way about connecting with visualizations that show space drawn out over those that show numbers listed. I feel like the context of the visualizations also informs the forms types of visualization for the project.  With Schmidt’s blog post, I kind of found the charts a little difficult to understand at first with the “over representation” versus “overall frequency” axes. I am also curious if there were other ways that he tried visualizing the data before he settled on the charts he put in the blog.   Were there any of the visualizations from the readings that you felt like you connected with  better than others? Mia, I really liked your question about historical accuracy vs. contemporary appeal–I think it is a good thing to think about! As someone who watched all of Downton Abbey (at the request of my mother but also, who am I kidding, I loved it) I can say that the historical appeal of the show wasn’t in their language, but rather in the visual depictions of a lost world and the relationships between the characters. While I think that historical accuracy is absolutely necessary in most places, TV shows that do their best and still make larger points about socioeconomic designations, war, and historical experience don’t need to live up to an academic standard. I would wager that very few individuals watch Downton Abbey to have an immersive historical experience. Most watch Downton Abbey to feel like they are part of a wealthy British world where kind servants bring you tea in the middle of the day. Ultimately, historians can (and should) contribute to conversations about historical accuracy in TV shows, but the struggle lies in creating something relatable to modern audiences. My mother had to look words and events up while watching Downton Abbey (and The Crown as well)–she learned about historical trends and vocabulary and lifestyle, and I think that is a pretty good accomplishment from a TV series. Hi Shae! Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Downton Abbey. Maybe I’ll give it a watch in the future! It’s awesome to hear about the ways that you and your mom connected with the show and learned more about historical lifestyles. It feels like most audiences take the history portrayed in historical dramas with a grain of salt anyways, and it could prompt people do some more research into the history after enjoying the show.  Were there any moments where you felt uneasy with the show’s portrayal of the past or found the anachronisms that Schmidt mentioned jarring? Yes I felt the same way about Downton Abbey when reading this. As an avid watcher of period pieces I don’t watch them for historical accuracy but instead for the simple entertainment of becoming invested in the lives of fictional characters and experiencing their adventures on screen. I love history but I do agree with Mia that it seems, for the most part, that period pieces take historical accuracy with a grain of salt to leave enough room for their creative take that will most definitely appeal to their modern audience. But for the sake of this class, it is fascinating that Schmidt could breakdown the language and cross reference it. Your email address will not be published.

Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon 2021 #DH­H21 | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki;"The Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon is a chance to experience an interdisciplinary research project from start to finish within the span of 10 days. For researchers and students from computer science and data science, the hackathon gives the opportunity to test their abstract knowledge against complex real-life problems. For people from the humanities and social sciences, it shows what is possible to achieve with such collaboration. 
 
For both, the hackathon gives the experience of intensely working with people from different backgrounds as part of an interdisciplinary team, as, during the hackathon, each group develops a digital humanities research project from start to finish. Working together, they formulate research questions with respect to particular data sets, develop and apply methods and tools to answer them, and present the work at the end of the hackathon. For information on what the hackathon was like in previous years, see #DHH19, #DHH18, #DHH17, #DHH16 and #DHH15. In 2021, the event was organized as an online hackathon. As a CLARIN, DARIAH and SSHOC summer school, the event was truly international, welcoming applications from all over Europe and beyond! Participation to #DHH is free to all accepted participants. 3–6 ECTS credits may be gained from participating in the hackathon for students in University of Helsinki and other universities. This year, the hackathon groups organized around the following seven themes, each of which has now been linked to the final output report written by the group (for the initial background presentations on the themes, see here). output: Eighteenth-Century English Versions of Pierre Bayle’s Dictionary: A Computational Study
 The hackathon took place between 19.–28.5.2021. The participants were expected to commit to the hackathon for the whole period; work took place mainly between 10 AM and 5 PM (Finland / EEST / UTC+03:00) on weekdays (the weekend was free!). In addition, there were three pre-sessions on Tuesdays 27.4., 4.5. and 11.5., between 2 – 4 PM for orientation, group formation and preparation for the intensive hackathon period. The participants were expected to attend also these pre-sessions. For more details, see the detailed timetable and further information on practicalities (including prerequisites and credits for students). Public presentations of the projects:

Data Literacy as Digital Humanities Literacy: Exploration of Threshold Concepts ← dh+lib;"where the digital humanities and librarianship meet For those who are both librarians and digital humanities instructors, we must either create new frameworks for teaching and learning or attempt to map existing ones to library instruction. “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance. Below, I propose threshold concepts for data literacy and illustrate how those concepts can provide a lens through which we can explore a piece of digital humanities scholarship. Defining threshold concepts will be useful in communication among digital humanists and our daily pedagogical work. To illustrate the application of these threshold concepts, I explore the data visualization project, Torn Apart/Separados, through a data literacy lens. The project team has clearly documented and shared their data collection processes and acknowledge the data’s limitations. Through these means, they invite a critical assessment of the data and its use, an overarching principle of data literacy (Calzada Prado & Marzal, 2013). “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance.
To discuss the utility of threshold concepts in data literacy, we must start from a shared understanding of them. Threshold concepts represent information previously not known by the learner, and once a person learns and understands that information, it permanently and drastically changes their perception of the topic (Meyer, Land & Baillie, 2010). A person who understands a threshold concept can ask more precise questions and will exhibit certain behaviors that show a deep level of understanding. “Digital humanities literacy” is a combination of many literacy areas. Still, the prevalence of data in both our daily lives and in digital humanities places data literacy in a position of importance. Data literacy, broadly, is the ability to critically create, manipulate, manage, analyze, understand, and communicate data (Koltay, 2014; Calzada Prado & Marzal, 2013; Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). Based on relevant work in data literacy and digital humanities, and topics I’ve found to be pertinent in my teaching, I propose and discuss preliminary threshold concepts for data literacy in digital humanities below. I’ve used these as a basis for defining learning outcomes and assessing students’ learning around working with humanities data. These concepts are understanding data as human and/or machine created information, recognizing data as only one part of a narrative, and the role of data in scholarship. Data is not inherently objective, even when created through a seemingly objective process.  Key questions for exploration Information literacy sessions typically cover familiar forms of knowledge dissemination, like books and presentations, which are directly created by humans. Data, on the other hand, can be created or simply influenced by humans. Increasingly, computational systems may not need direct input to create data (think a timestamp on a saved file), or they can create new information based on previous input (think machine learning). Even lacking direct input, the system programmer decides when one thing happens, another thing must be true, or a behavioral researcher decides one variable is important to collect while another is not. Data is always affected by human intervention, even if a human did not directly create it. As such, data is not inherently more objective than a journal article or conference talk, though we often hear that students tend to see data in this way (Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). As much as we try to remove bias from our computing processes, decisions made during the creation process influence the final dataset because “people choose what to count or measure” (Schield, 2004, pp. 7). Data in Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 is gathered from multiple governmental sources, including the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division, and restructured to fit the needs of the project. One variable that ICE collects on its detainees is whether they are “criminal.” An early learner of data literacy might accept that information as fact, without asking more questions about how the value of “criminal” is determined. Criminal is a loaded term with meaning that can vary based on cultural, societal, and even demographic factors (do we consider a child who steals candy a “criminal”?). Which crimes earn a “criminal” signifier? A data literate person will ask questions about how the value is determined, who assigns the value, and what societal factors might influence the value. These are research questions in their own right, and the answers are not always readily (if at all) available. However, when learners understand the process of data creation as wholly guided by humans, they think critically about that process and how that affects any data they examine. These effects can be mitigated by supplementing a data-based result with other pieces of information. Data is one piece of a whole narrative, and cannot give a complete picture alone. Key questions for exploration Data serves as a “snapshot” representation of a particular reality. Because of the notion that data is inherently objective, we tend to believe data-driven conclusions more readily than other forms of knowledge (Fontichiaro & Oehrli, 2016). A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset. The ability to act when data is absent, and to understand the limitations of data-driven analysis, will continue to be highly desirable skills for all workers, not just those in DH (Davies, Fidler & Gorbis, 2020). A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset.
The base data visualization in Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 tells us that ICE-affiliated detention centers are widespread, which are in use, and some are not, the average daily population, and other characteristics. None of this factual information demonstrates how these centers can operate, a question which the project team set out to answer. Volume 2 analyzes the flow of money between ICE, government officials, and the contractors who complete work for them. This additional piece of information draws the story closer to a complete picture of the current state of immigration policy and enforcement in the US. A data literate person can effectively use the information in both Volumes 1 and 2 to draw correlations between operating costs and facility use, which was impossible without the new information Volume 2 provides. All of this information, from the data to the interpretations presented, are equally integral parts of the research process. A data literate person understands this connection between data and reality and can identify gaps or discrepancies between them. Once those gaps are identified, they can reasonably suggest other pieces of information to complete a narrative or verify claims derived from a dataset. Data is an artifact of the iterative process of research.  Key questions for exploration In digital humanities projects, data can appear both as the subject and product of research. Considering Christof Schöch’s distinction between “big” and “smart” data in the humanities is useful here, wherein big data is relatively unstructured but massive, and smart data is more structured and relatively small (Schöch, 2013). A dataset created by a DH researcher that is new, unique, and derived from multiple information sources is “smart” data. Like a published article, the dataset itself is an integral part of the research process. Findable, reusable, and well-preserved data ensures reproducibility and enables others to ask similar questions. A data literate person understands the flow of data from original source, to researcher, to final presented dataset, and knows how to find information on how the data was modified and recreated at each stage. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners.
Torn Apart/Separados Volume 1 visualizes structured data garnered directly from other sources on a map for exploration and interpretation (another example of “smart” data). The original data is gathered from various organizations, and the cleaned, reformatted versions are preserved on the project’s GitHub repository. Project documentation explains the information in the dataset and its original sources. In this case, data is both the subject and product of research. A data literate researcher reusing or examining the project’s data can easily find documentation on how the data was modified throughout the project and, thus, gains a critical understanding of the process of data creation, transformation, and presentation. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners. Understanding how data is created, data’s capacity to be a form of knowledge, and data’s role in scholarship are crucial for DH practitioners. These concepts are meant to serve as preliminary benchmarks to gauge learners’ critical understanding of data creation, use, analysis, and sharing.

Skill level: BeginnerPrerequisites/requirements: Google Chrome and Firefox top Instructor: Nada AmmaguiDate: Thursday, February 11, 2021Time: 1000-1200 EST | 1900-2100 GST  Google Sheets is a web-based spreadsheet program, equivalent in some ways to Microsoft Excel, with a wide array of features and uses. For people who would like to embark on a digital humanities project, it is one of many options for organizing data. This workshop is aimed at total beginners and will introduce a few ways to facilitate automatic data entry, organization, and visualization on Google Sheets. The skills presented in this workshop are suitable for anyone working with spreadsheets, and apply for any project in which there is repeated information (names, places, objects, dates). We will learn to sort and filter data, auto-populate cells, and organize sheets visually. The workshop is in three parts: first, an overview of Google Sheets and potential use cases (e.g., art exhibitions over time, books authored by a publishing house); second, a detailed explanation of some of Google Sheets’ features (Code Tables, Data Validation, Conditional Formatting, VLookup, Column Stats and Filters, and Pivot Tables); and third, a walk-through of these tools using a sample data set. Participants can follow along with the walk-through by using their own data or the sample set provided. Skill level: Total BeginnerPrerequisites/requirements: Basic familiarity with Google Sheets or Excel. The course will be carried out using Google Sheets. You will be added to a shared sheet using the email address that you provide for the registration, so a Google account is required. Participants can also observe the process without using the Sheets and can use their own data set to practice the skills learned. top Instructor: Victor WestrichDate: Tuesday, February 9, 2021Time: 1300-1500 EST | 2200-2400 GST This course will focus on using the programming language R as a way of visualizing spatial data. It will use four humanities datasets (pre-modern and modern, from Europe and the Middle East) and provide participants with the code required to carry out the visualization. We will discuss how participants might match different kinds of spatial datasets for different visualizations in Shiny. We will approach the visualization process in four steps: (1) discussing what the “story” of our data is, and which aspects or conclusions from it we want to illuminate via visualization. (2) preprocessing our data into a dataset. Here it is especially important to determine the aspects of a given dataset, i.e. if a two-faceted approach is satisfactory or if a more faceted approach (e.g. temporospatial) is required. (3) choosing the clearest and most efficient visual representation for our dataset. (4) selecting the most viable user interface to maximize accessibility and impact of our visualization. Skill level: IntermediatePrerequisites/requirements: Basic familiarity with Leaflet & a programming language such as R. The course will be carried out using RStudio Cloud. You will be added to an account using the email address that you provide for the registration and you will need to activate it by responding to an email before the session. Participants can also observe the process without being added to RStudio Cloud. top Instructor: Nicholas WolfDate:  Thursday, February 11, 2021Time: 1800-2000 EST | 0300-0500 GST (12 Feb)  This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to construct their own digital text corpus for conducting humanities data analysis. We’ll cover simple tools for turning printed texts in a variety of languages into computer-readable files, the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, and consider helpful tools for post-process correction of digitized texts. We’ll also look at open-access text-as-data sources available over simple web-browser-based API calls. The workshop is geared toward digital humanists needing to assemble text data that are not yet compiled or in computer readable form for analysis, and who are looking for an introduction to the workflows and software suited to building the research materials needed for analysis. We’ll learn how to use Tesseract, an open-source OCR software, consider the anatomy of an HOCR file (the output of OCR efforts), and deploy techniques for extracting structured information from a page. Skill level: IntermediatePrerequisites/requirements: Familiarity with using a web browser, willingness to try out some short command-line steps with guidance, interest in text-as-data analysis projects. Participants should have a computer with a text editor installed such as BBEdit, TextWrangler, Atom, Notepad++ or the like; administrator access to install open-source software (Tesseract). top Copyright © 2022 · Executive Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in";https://wp.nyu.edu/widh/widhnycdh-2021/;
Opening the Anthropocene Archives - Public Books;"We are living astride two epochs in geological time. The first, the Holocene, began about 11,700 years ago; the second, the Anthropocene, now defines our troubled present. In a 2002 article, the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer suggested that we have entered a new era in geological time called the Anthropocene epoch. This shift to a “human-dominated, geological epoch” is significant, according to Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin, because the “impacts of human activity” will be “observable in the geological stratigraphic record for millions of years to come.”1
And yet, the Anthropocene has all too often been conceived in narrowly physical terms, such as rock layers and glacier ice. These physical records are undoubtedly crucial to understanding whether humanity has measurably affected the earth system. But deep analysis of digitized historical archives can allow us to understand how and why these changes occurred. Bridging the divide between scientific and humanistic understandings can only enrich the scientific models of this new human age.
Since the Anthropocene has been triggered by human actions, we can see a detailed record of those world-making activities in the newly accessible form of digitized archives. These were previously locked in libraries that required sleuthing, on the order of The Da Vinci Code or Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, through dusty manuscripts. And even though libraries and cultural-heritage institutions have spent millions of dollars over decades to digitize their holdings, still, they have mostly been used to pursue conventional humanities questions. How can we use these digital archives to envision the contribution of humanistic work on the scale of geological time, rather than just on the scale of literary history, canons, or periodization?








As one example, our Digital History of the Anthropocene project uses recent advances in digital-humanities methods, perhaps best known for their application to language patterns in literary texts, to mine these historical digitized archives in order to better understand what people since 1610 (one of the candidate years for the start of the Anthropocene) have been thinking about, discussing, and debating—how to define the idea of the earth and man’s changing place on it.
Put another way, the Anthropocene has long been discussed in terms of hard science. Yet, if it is an age caused and created by humans, then the Anthropocene must also be examined from all human perspectives. What, then, do the humanities have to teach about the Anthropocene?
Our archives are no longer stacks of historical documents for posterity. They contain an understanding of history as a geologic record written by the human hand.
The Anthropocene has provoked a far-reaching debate among scholars from a wide range of fields spanning the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The historian Dipesh Chakrabarty has prompted us to grapple with the sobering knowledge that human society has an effect beyond the passing of generations, or even civilizations—how can we conceptualize the collective impact of our activities within the staggering scale of geological time? How can we begin to fathom our future obsolescence by imagining our place in the fossil record alongside the dinosaurs?
For scientists, however, these existential issues have been pushed aside for more prosaic matters: In what year did this Anthropocene present start? In May 2019, the Anthropocene Working Group, composed of scientists from the International Commission on Stratigraphy, voted to approve the mid-20th century—the time range now recognized as inaugurating the atomic age and the “great acceleration” of society’s impact on the environment—as the officially recommended origin point of the Anthropocene period.
However, a backlash emerged from this dating, with scholars from a wide range of perspectives and disciplines arguing that it is far too early to set a date in stone. Although scientists are well equipped to understand if chemical forces shaping the physical and geographic record across time are present and measurable, they do not understand how and why humans caused such changes.
To understand these underlying causes, we must attend carefully to the human social and cultural record that describes, over time, how human beings have reshaped the earth. Our archives are no longer stacks of historical documents for posterity. These archives now contain an understanding of history as a geologic record written by the human hand.
Geologists and climate scientists have recently called for a broader debate, in order to define a more historically sensitive vision of the Anthropocene that engages, in the words of Erle Ellis, the “diverse array” of “material records of human alterations of Earth,”2 from records in historical and cultural archives that are as necessary to an understanding of the Anthropocene as are stratigraphic rock layers.

Why an Age of Machine Learning Needs the...
By Ted Underwood
						







Digital History of the Anthropocene focused on the Renaissance, because we have a good historical understanding of this time period; 1610 was nearing the end of Shakespeare’s dramatic career, and we have an abundance of digitized records, including scanned and transcribed texts from Early English Books Online, a digital archive of up to 130,000 texts from this time, and the HathiTrust Digital Library, which contains over 17 million volumes from the medieval period to the present day.
To work through these large digital archives, we adapted a range of machine-learning algorithms for text analysis. These were originally built for search engines and for social-media-platform ranking and filtering but can be retuned to identify large-scale trends within historical archives. The algorithm’s methods all work by identifying groups of words that have a very high likelihood of coexisting near one another within the sentences, paragraphs, and whole books composing the archives. These methods help us understand words and phrases as they were actually used and as they signified “in the wild” of human culture.
We used these methods to ask questions of the scientific rationale and the underlying historical assumptions for the different dates previous geological and chemical studies have proposed. Did Renaissance culture naively raze the natural world for the sake of inexorable technological and economic progress, as some origin narratives of the modern world and climate change begin? Like Dr. Seuss’s Once-ler character, who gained a self-conscious awareness of the error of his ways far too late to restore his ecosystem, can we, today, perceive man’s effect on the earth in a way that previous generations could not? Is this self-awareness of our ability to change the earth, which we now call the Anthropocene, a feature of our modern, technologically enriched and scientifically advanced era?
The Renaissance understanding of latitude, sunlight, and time was the original definition of “climate.”
What we found, in response to these questions, was more complex than what we had expected. We unearthed a fundamentally different Renaissance worldview and a bizarrely unexpected definition of life as it inhabits the earth. These ideas reshaped our understanding of the historical conditions at the beginnings of the Anthropocene epoch.
Our models persistently clustered words such as latitude, climate, zones, tropics, poles, complexion, and equinoctial in books from a wide, and seemingly unrelated, group of genres. As we examined these results, we saw that the common thread linking all of these words, phrases, and texts was a commonly assumed Renaissance earth system.
This system defined life across the globe in terms of the latitude bands dividing the globe into navigable global space. A latitude defines the amount of sunlight per day an area receives from the sun, with each degree of latitude representing increments of daylight. This system of latitude, sunlight, and time was the original definition of “climate.”
Rather than the long-term weather patterns we describe today, climate—in the Renaissance—was the spatial organization of the earth’s surface into latitude zones with a measurable amount of sunlight. This organization, in turn, dictated the environmental conditions of locations situated along that degree, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Most importantly, such an organization demonstrated—to the Renaissance mind—what plants and animals could survive and thrive in these places.

Strikingly, our models also repeatedly linked places and texts about a jumble of locations that seemed to have no relationship, and which we feared were spurious results. Books and passages about Virginia, Portugal, Spain, India, and China were grouped together in our models. This indicated that these locations shared similar word and phrase patterns, and that these texts used similar descriptive language for all of these places.
Unlike now, when our organization of the globe is by continents, or by hemispheric divisions such as “east/west” or “old world / new world,” in 1610 the world was organized by degrees of latitude. Locations along a latitude band would conceivably share more in common than locations at different latitudes on the same continent, or in adjacent nations. And so, in geographical explorations of the nascent Virginia colonies, Englishmen leaned on a comparative worldview that made sense of the new world in terms of other places at the same latitude. Such globalized thinking led to speculation that silk could grow profitably in Jamestown, because it shared the same climate as China.
This strange vitalist vision was able to closely affiliate two places 10s of thousands of miles apart, and it forced early-modern humans to define humanity and society in a fundamental relationship to the earth and its climate.

This may sound akin to an Edenic innocence, in which people were more attuned to the rhythms of the natural world. This interpretation, however, was not what we found in our models, which often contained results that were far darker.
The Renaissance definition—climate as a basis for biology at a global scale—was the principle upon which England built its idea of empire, by setting the parameters for how flora and fauna could be moved and transplanted across the earth in order to establish stable colonies. Climate was the spatial blueprint upon which England built colonial trade and its outposts—purposefully, along latitude bands, where living things could be easily exchanged.
Based on our experiments mining the digitized archives of the Renaissance, poring over texts—both famous and obscure—we found that the Anthropocene era and the global movement of life that triggered a global drop in carbon dioxide identified by scientists at the time was not a byproduct of colonialism. It was the motivation for colonialism itself.

Swimming in the Anthropocene
By Steve Mentz
						







Apart from exploring digitized historical archives from the Renaissance era, we are also expanding our research to examine literary and historical archives from the 20th century to understand the discourse around the mid-20th-century dating of the Anthropocene, as a more contemporary correlate to the historical analysis we have conducted for the 1610 dating. And we are using these methods on government environmental and weather data, as well as plant archives, to understand whether or not we can extract useful information from archival datasets to assess chemical and physical changes in the earth system.
We have designed our project as an example of the digital humanities whose primary goal is not to produce new readings of literary texts—many scholars already do this well. Rather, these methods scour our text archives for patterns of meaning and worldviews and debates that we have lost today, which challenge our assumptions about humans and their role in shaping the planet.

Neotopology | Digital Humanities at Stanford;"This is part of a talk I gave at #txdhc. It leaves out ""principles of interloping in network science"" which I'll try to put in a later post. When I was invited to give a talk at The Texas Digital Humanities Consortium's First Annual Conference about networks and specifically networks in the humanities, I asked myself the same thing I did when I was asked to write D3.js in Action: how can I speak on something for which I don't have a degree? How can I write a book about programming when I don't have a degree in computer science? Similarly, how can I give a talk about networks when I don't have a degree in network science? Obviously, I have some experience with networks, such as my work representing topic models as a network.  I’ve noticed, in the past, when I’ve given more involved talks or papers dealing with networks, that I find both my audience and myself more comfortable with focusing on network representation, commonly referred to as network visualization. The network visualization of the results of a topic model is rather effective and sophisticated, I think, but I also don't have a degree in design or information science, so once again I'm outside of my domain of credentialed expertise. So, sometimes I dodge that position and focus on the use of networks in the publication of research. Networks as a rhetorical device, in tandem with text and maps, especially in the genre of interactive scholarly works, like Kindred Britain, and especially its Stories component, that ties together text, maps, networks, and other data visualization.  But I'm not a publisher, and have never worked for a publisher. So, I fall back on my old standby, ORBIS, and instead focus more on transportation networks and especially historical transportation networks.  But I also don't have a degree in geography or in classics. Like many people who shift away from their original domain of expertise into a well-defined field with its own journals and conferences, I begin to feel like there’s really only one subject with which I might treat as an expert: Imposter Syndrome. But there are examples of successful practitioners working in fields like this with a wealth of established research. After all, Franco Moretti is not a statistician. Or, as you may have heard it stated: Franco Moretti is not a statistician!!!!!!11!111oneone!one And while he may not be a statistician, neither is he an imposter. Rather, like me, and like many people in digital humanities, he is an interloper. And so that’s what I’m here to talk about: Interloping. I think interloping, more than computational approaches or the digital broadly construed as the object of study, defines digital humanities. And scholars are not the only ones interloping. We find ourselves awash in accessible, powerful tools and techniques that seem well-suited for our research and entice us into fields and disciplines with which we haven’t the wealth of domain expertise that we do in our primary fields. It means that we approach these techniques in a naive manner, but as humanists, we have recourse to this seeming impediment. Yes, when you first begin to model your study of literature using networks, you do so as a beginner. But, as Shunryu Suzuki notes in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, this perspective is open to possibilities in a way that the better versed may not be. This approach is idealistic, I am not. I know, from experience, that the interloper is constantly exposed to critique for using methods naively, for not understanding basic principles of the research method and existing scholarship, and for suggesting narratives that clash with the traditional understanding of a field. There are, however, several mitigating factors when it comes to the principles of interloping in network science. The first requires a detour into geography. I know you didn’t  for a geography lecture, and so I’ll keep it short, but in my defense, I’m always mentioning networks when I talk about geography, so at least I’m consistently disappointing. I titled my talk neotopology because I believe that this network turn resembles the spatial turn in more ways than one. One of those ways is the presence of a vibrant community of practice growing outside the traditional domains where in one case network analysis/visualization and in the other case spatial analysis/visualization traditionally occurs. Neogeography, in short, refers to the use of cartographic and spatial analytic tools and techniques by designers, humanists, software developers and others outside of the traditional domains of GIS, GIScience and cartography. It has, at times, caused some consternation and led to fierce claims both in digital humanities and in the tech industry that the geographic information systems being developed by such interlopers are, ""Not GIS"". It has also elicited, from time to time, angry responses from these traditional domains directed at flaneurs running amok with ArcGIS and Google Maps API. Which itself has also spurred defensiveness.  But neogeography has produced incredible work, including the amazing Voronoi experiments that Jason Davies has been creating, satellite projected views of the US/Mexico border by Mike Bostock, and incredible innovation in the tile space, such as base maps that look like wood inlay, or Stamen's watercolor map here enhanced with semi-transparent satellite imagery for great effect:  Add to this online mapping applications developed in fan culture, such as that of the LOTR Project, and we can see a vibrant community of practice in a world once dominated by GIS Professionals and GIScience academics. While neogeography is a product of broad accessibility of GIS tools and techniques, it is further defined by its strong integration with information visualization. Geospatial information visualization refers to something besides maps and atlases, it refers, I would argue, to the primacy of a system or model for which the geospatial data is just one view into that model. There’s another thing that neogeography has in common with neotopology, and which allows me to end my geography detour: humanists are not the only interlopers in the field. In the same way that journalists, designers and software developers and humanities scholars have flooded into spatial analysis and visualization, the same groups are flooding into network analysis and visualization.     Here we see three examples among many. The first is Mike Bostock, creator of the D3.js information visualization library and award-winning journalist at the New York Times, taking a network perspective on the Oscars. The second is designer Christian Swinehart's amazing exploration of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novels, where the network connects passages in the novel based on the decision points at the ends of those passages, with gruesome endings in vivid color. The last is the result of my own look into the way in which TV Tropes works are connected by shared tropes, and what it might mean to bridge the disparate genres explored by that community. But there are striking differences in the situation surrounding the spatial turn and the situation surrounding the network turn. When the Anne Knowles edited Past Time, Past Place: GIS for History was published, it was 12 years ago. This was four years before Twitter, two years before Facebook and a time when English Wikipedia had only 20,000 articles. In 2002, scholars like Willard McCarty in ""Humanities Computing: Essential Problems, Experimental Practice"" were not even referring to digital humanities, but rather ""humanities computing"" and ""computer assisted humanities"": ...through Galison’s metaphor of the trading zone, it gives depth of meaning to the often ad hoc and ill-understood practice of collaboration in the computer-assisted humanities: it helps us to understand how people from very different fields can do laboratory-based research well--do research better than alone, or at all--while remaining undiluted intellectually… Most notably for humanist scholars trying to use GIS, they had access to either a very user unfriendly ArcGIS 8, or write their own code. Google Earth was an obscure hermeneutic toy known as Earthviewer 3D, created by a company you likely never heard of. And it's not even fair to peg Past Time, Past Place to 2002, since this volume was a collection of essays that occurred after an enthusiastic adoption from which we can extrapolate an even earlier date of sophisticated engagement. We are so early in the Network Turn that there has appeared, as yet, no comparable volume for networks. Our only real landmark comparison for Networks in Humanities is Tim Tangherlini’s “Networks and Network Analysis for the Humanities” funded by the NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities. It included participation by academics such as Katy Borner, Franco Moretti and Dave Blei, but also industry interlopers like Fernando Diaz, then senior research scientist at Yahoo! Research and now at Microsoft Research. In contrast to the bleak situation 12 years ago, we began making this network turn in a dramatically different ecosystem. This is not to say there are not conferences with the aim of focusing on networks in the humanities, such as Arts, Humanities, and Complex Networks, a satellite symposium at NetSci that's been running for five years. Rather, I mean that network analysis in digital humanities scholarship is so early on that it hasn't even managed to put together and publish a single edited volume. There is another, and for academics sharper, contrast. The network turn, after all, is taking place after the spatial turn. That means it's taking place with a model for how to respond to collaboration and colonization by a method and its attendent experts. And while there are rich reflections on what it means to bring spatial analysis in contact with humanities scholarship it is even more readily apparent in the covers and titles of similar volumes published since Past Time, Past Place, most of which do not have covers featuring maps made with GIS packages but rather word clouds, the Peutinger table (neogeography from the Roman world), or abstract paintings. As digital humanities scholarship continues to mature, the old call to authority about how to use digital objects, tools and related techniques is not so intimidating. We learned, as we deconstructed GIS and NLP, that we could use these things, too. The spatial turn was not about historians learning GIS, it was about everyone getting access to a host of geospatial data, tools and techniques, and then doing whatever they wanted with it, until they felt perfectly comfortable doing ""GIS"" or not. It was not that GIS could not handle the fuzziness, incompleteness, and uncertainty of humanities scholarship, but that the practitioners who had built and designed (and to be fair to many, generously taught us) traditional mapping and GIS tools simply had not thought of it. It was up to the interlopers to address these approaches and develop methods to deal with them.  We will not follow the same path with network analysis, because the environment today is thus vastly different. And there’s something even more fundamental about networks that makes us, as interlopers, more equipped to adopt and adapt them: Networks are simple. Networks are whatever you define them as, within a basic set of attributes. While there are best practices insofar as how to constrain and structure a network, it is fundamentally a view of the phenomenon you wish to study--a network perspective. You will often hear that you cannot use, for instance, an n-partite network, or a hypergraph. But that advice is from the perspective of computing across the network to measure centrality, clustering, modularity and other traditional network measures. If you’re using a network as a supplement, as a view into your work that emphasizes the structure rather than the components, and you’re not computing centrality, then it is valid if only as part of a dialectical examination in tension with your traditional scholarship. A network is a view of a system that preferences the importance of connections between objects in that system and the emergent properties of those connections when examined in the aggregate in a way distinct from a demographic or biographic or geographic perspective typical in humanities scholarship. This is, I think, where we shine as humanists and interlopers. Our work with networks is not our sole methodology or concern, and our engagement with networks reflects that in the same way that our engagement with spatial analysis has. Are more central people more likely to also have stronger metadata? Does betweenness correlate with nationality? And how does it compare to the networks and network structures discovered or created not only by other academics, but by those created by journalists and in fan culture and in industry? To return to this definition of digital humanities as interloping, it serves to go back to McCarty's examination of the Trading Zone: In his magisterial study, Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics, Galison shows us in detail how individuals engaged in a bundle of rather disparate activities came together and successfully collaborated to solve the most difficult experimental problems of their day. His historiography is centred on the machinery these activities had in common (e.g. the devices invented to study subatomic interactions) and the users’ intellectual and pragmatic negotiations of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. He proposes and develops an anthropological-linguistic analogy for these negotiations, which he calls the Trading Zone. In a typical trading zone people from mutually incomprehensible cultures come together to trade objects of interest. To do that, as in fact happens, they develop a highly restricted proto-language or pidgin for their negotiations. This pidgin allows them to reach agreement among themselves about objects of trade even though outside of the zone, within their own cultures, their understandings and uses of these objects differ radically. We are, in our engagement with networks, interloping. But network science teaches us that the interlopers, the people who connect disparate, unconnected groups, derive power from that position. I think all of us, after thinking deeply about networks, have had it influence the way that we engage in the networks we take part in. The network turn itself is one of those networks. Notes from the talk: 1. There was some controversy over whether network analysis is ""the trading zone"" and whether one can reasonably refer to a network science. I must admit to using network science in a very pragmatic manner, simply meaning it to stand in as a blanket statement for social network analysis, transportation network analysis, and various disparate but established fields and sub-disciplines that have used networks for decades. 2. Insofar as I mean ""the network turn"" I'm not referring to the application of network analysis by any research agenda, since obviously scholars in a number of fields have long been using network analysis. Rather, I refer to the widespread adoption of network analysis and visualization by humanities scholars to address traditional humanities research questions. 3.

During a time when disrupted classes, cancelled exams, and interrupted research became the norm, it would have been expected to see resources like Gale Primary Sources or Gale Digital Scholar Lab experience a decline in usage, since module leaders had less time to teach students and researchers how to use them. Read our Gale Digital Scholar Lab Impact Report to see what we found out... The Gale Review includes Digital Humanities related blog posts written by our publishing teams, guest academics and student ambassadors as they unearth fascinating primary sources that have yet to be studied – or explore frequently studied topics from exciting new angles.     Recordings of DH webinars that Gale have hosted are now available.  Focusing on teaching, researching and supporting DH, these webinars look at some of the challenges faced by universities, faculty and libraries around the world.    Learn how the Gale Digital Scholar Lab has successfully enabled a university to enhance and accelerate introductory undergraduate modules in Digital Humanities.  As part of the Bodleian Visiting Fellows Programme, Gale are pleased to support Fellowships undertaking a 3 month period of Digital Humanities research at the University of Oxford using the Centre for Digital Scholarship of the Bodleian Libraries. Information regarding the candidates and their projects are available here. On 2nd May 2019 we hosted the DH Day at the British Library. A diverse and popular line up of speakers representing DH scholarship and academic libraries from around the world, presented the international scope of digital humanities research; how it is being applied to large content sets like newspapers, how it is being taught in the classroom and what the library is doing to support DH within their institutions. You can now download the proceedings papers - or  on the video soundbites below to listen to snippets of the speakers presentations. Seth Cayley, VP Gale Primary Sources introduces our BL Speakers papers in this opening chapter.  The DH day was split into four distinct sessions: (1) Literature & Distant Reading; (2) Computers
Reading the News; (3) Digital Humanities in the Classroom; and (4) Institutional Support and
Infrastructure for digital humanities. Each session was designed to put a spotlight on different
themes in digital humanities, with the first two focusing on the latest research, and the latter two
exploring issues around teaching and the role of the library.
In this volume you will find four of the papers that were presented on that day. Read the introductory chapter here.  Joris van Eijnatten, previously Professor of Cultural History at Utrecht University, provides a textbook example of how using n-grams and other textual analysis tools can lead to new and interesting discoveries.

Reframing Digital Humanities by Julian Chambliss, an OER Text – Laurie N. Taylor, Librarian;Laurie Taylor is the Senior Director for Library Technology & Digital Strategies. She provides leadership for technology and partnerships with the University of Florida Libraries across the university, regionally, nationally, and internationally. She works closely with colleagues to sustain collaborations for building collections, community, and capacity, including for the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) and LibraryPress@UF. Her work is geared towards enabling a culture of radical collaboration that values and supports diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thoughts my own. Julian Chambliss’ awesome Reframing Digital Humanities series 2 podcast is now also an OER text! The full volume is online: https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/reframingdh/ From Chambliss’ “Introduction”: Reframing History was inspired by the idea of providing a public narrative about work rooted in the community and relying on digital practice. Season one of Reframing History documented our efforts to tell that local history story and called my attention to how the challenge of definition around digital humanities, which is understood somewhat within academia, is a worthwhile public scholarship project. Thus, season 2 of Reframing History became a series of conversations with scholars about digital humanities. To create the list of interviewees, I relied on my own digital past and present. As such, I cannot argue that the conversations are encyclopedic or vital actors that might define digital humanities in meaningful ways were not omitted. If you are coming to this project searching for certainty, you will be disappointed. What I can say is, within the confines of the limitations of my knowledge and experience with digital humanities practice, this set of conversations touched on many of the issues I find to be crucial to understanding the values of digital humanities. The conversations in Part I: Visioning Digital Humanities were with Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Rob Nelson, Sharon Leon, and Kathryn Tomasek and they offer through their experience a framing of the hope for the digital to enhance the public’s engagement with the humanities comes into view.  Part II: Identity and Digital Humanities highlights how recovering voices and surfacing patterns in our collective lived experience can be achieved through digital means. Scholars such as Maryemma Graham, Hilary Green, Dhanashree Thorat, and Roopika Risam are doing that work and offer crucial perspectives on the ideas that drive them and the implications for public knowledge. Part III: Cultural Reproduction and Digital Humanities offer a way to think about how that public knowledge equation manifest as scholars utilize the digital to further their work.  Concluding this work with a conversation with the members of CEDAR seems both appropriate and timely. Our discussion about what DH can do continues the process of visioning we are doing. I think we all recognize the impact of the COVID pandemic will be with us for years to come, and the place digital humanities will play in the future needs to be considered carefully. As a transcript derived from a recording, I hope you will recognize that we took pains to try to maintain the integrity of the subject’s words while attempting to make a conversation understood in written form. In the end, I think we managed to accomplish the goal of archiving these meaningful conversations. This is a super fantastic new volume for folks teaching and researching in DH, with accessible chapters representing different interview discussions and projects that speak to the diversity of the field and specific projects and perspectives. I am super excited to see this out, and to see what will build and come from this! Laurie N.

News Bureau | ILLINOIS;"Projects led by Illinois music professor Gabriel Solis and HathiTrust Research Center associate director Glen Worthey will enhance access to archival jazz and digital humanities collections. The projects are collaborative efforts funded through a new grant program by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. Photo of Gabriel Solis by Darrell Hoemann; photo of Glen Worthey by Cindy Brya CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are among the first recipients of new grant funding to advance digital scholarship in cultural institutions, through a joint initiative of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. The first round of NEH/AHRC New Directions for Digital Scholarship in Cultural Institutions grants provides funding to eight teams of international researchers for collaborative projects. The program aims to develop new methods of sharing culture and heritage with global audiences, open new research frontiers and advance collections-based research methods. Gabriel Solis, a music professor and the head of the theatre department, is the project director of “New Directions in Digital Jazz Studies: Music Information Retrieval and AI Support for Jazz Scholarship in Digital Archives,” a collaboration with City, University of London. A team of musicologists, computer scientists and jazz archivists is using artificial intelligence and music information-retrieval tools to enhance access to archival jazz collections, including those held by the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, Newark and the Scottish Jazz Archive. The team will build “smart” search capacities based on music information-retrieval algorithms. Its research will allow for automated transcription and melodic pattern analysis of audio collections in jazz archives, furthering new discoveries in the audio recordings held by archives that have not circulated widely as commercial releases. Linking this audio information to other kinds of archival holdings relating to the music and musicians, such as texts and images, will give the jazz world new tools to further understand the music’s rich history, Solis said. Glen Worthey, the associate director for research support services at the HathiTrust Research Center, is the project director of “AEOLIAN (Artificial intelligence for cultural organizations),” a collaboration with Loughborough University in the U.K. The project will bring together a team of experts to develop and examine new approaches – particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning – for improving access to and use of digital collections that are currently restricted due to privacy concerns or copyright protection. The objectives are to make the digital collections more accessible; to analyze them using innovative AI research methods; and to identify potential collaborations between U.S. and U.K. cultural organizations, Worthey said. The research team will organize six online workshops over two years; grow the international network of scholars working with digital archives; and produce a major interdisciplinary report on the uses of AI at cultural institutions, along with a series of agenda-setting scholarly publications, Worthey said. The collaborative effort is being led by the HathiTrust Research Center, which is co-hosted by the School of Information Sciences. It involves partnerships with several U.S. and U.K. universities and libraries, and digital humanities research scholars.

Why is most of the 20th Century invisible to AI? - CILIP: the library and information association;"Risk aversion is the issue that Professor Melissa Terras returns to again and again when she talks about copyright. She says that circumstances – financial, political and cultural – mean institutions increasingly resort to a blanket ‘no’
                    when asked to take any copyright risk. As a data scientist and information engineer – rather than a professional librarian – is she just impatient with the sector’s tried and tested safety mechanisms? This could be answered by pointing out that she is CILIP chartered (she discovered
                    her own personal attitude to risk on a Naomi Korn copyright course), is a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, has taught library students at UCL, and chairs the Library & Information Systems Committee for Arts, Humanities
                    and Social Sciences, responsible for spending on library materials and systems across a third of the University of Edinburgh. But even if she didn’t have these credentials, her observations about the bizarre impact of copyright on
                    research should prompt institutions to reassess their attitude to copyright risk. “I think the blanket ‘no’ should be replaced by risk assessment” she says, “because this should be about institutions understanding their capacity for risk. They should ask “what’s the worst thing that can happen?” I’ve read that only
                    seven libraries have been taken to court in the UK. And if they’re more worried about reputational risk than the benefit they might bring to their audience, there is a problem. Because is it really copyright – the right of the author
                    – that you’re worried about?” “Being on the boards of certain places, I can see that institutions are inherently risk averse. They don’t want any bad press, they don’t want to use institutional resources paying for lawyers, they don’t even want that conversation. So,
                    while the tension should be ‘yes there is copyright, and yes we should be respectful of creators’, that is not where we are now, we are in a state of paralysis.” However, Melissa acknowledges that, right now, cultural institutions face a perfect storm: “The political and financial threats our institutions face are real. They are not just a perceived threat – it’s a very dangerous time to speak
                    up and rock the boat when you don’t even know if you’re going to have an operational budget next year.” The problem isn’t just a sector on the backfoot. As chair of a university library committee, she has followed the current ebook pricing controversy and believes it is a symptom of a deeper problem. “They’re fleecing us. I understand there’s
                    a commercial opportunity, but this is during a pandemic. So, I think part of the problem is the way that commercial suppliers view universities as cash cows. Ebook pricing is symptomatic of many things that are wrong with the way the
                    information environment works around universities and research. How, in a world where we are all working from home, can the information environment be so locked down? It is the fear of copyright and the licences which are entered into
                    with the major suppliers. This is not just a research issue. It is a point of social justice. If you go to a rich university, you will have access to information that you can’t get at your local college.” But it is in her own areas of expertise that she can describe the tangible impact of copyright restrictions and the fear around them. In an era when computers are learning to measure the influence of culture, copyright keeps the 20th and
                    21st Century off limits. Melissa’s career path started off firmly in the arts. A revelation came when she was asked to present her undergraduate dissertation (on ancient Greek art) in a multimedia project. “That’s when I saw I should be doing computing. Before
                    that I was a bit lost. People were saying it wasn’t an area of academic study – that computing in arts and humanities wasn’t a real thing. But I saw that it was, like a truth of the universe.” She turned this realisation into a reality, converting to a masters in computing science, followed by a PhD in engineering at Oxford. “At Oxford I was working in a group that did image processing – extracting information from digital images.
                    It’s very common now, with face and handwriting recognition. We were applying techniques used to interpret medical images to ancient documents, using them to read things that were too damaged for the human eye. A computer can take
                    each mark and say ‘this is likely to be a handwriting stroke’ or “this is likely to be wood grain” or “this is likely to be noise because it was buried for 2,000 years”. You pull out all the scratches and then run probability engines
                    over what is left, like a crossword puzzle. The big one we did that the historians were really excited about was a document proving that the Roman Army had road tax in northern Britain.” To read Roman artefacts computers needed a to be trained on a digital library of handwriting to see if a mark was part of a message or noise. Now, among the things that Melissa and her students use computational techniques for, is the
                    investigation of individuals rather than artefacts – to see how they have been influenced by culture. Instead of a library of marks, a conventional library of books – digitised in full – is needed and can provide insights that were
                    impossible in a pre-digital era. “I had a PhD student called Dr Helen O’Neill and she worked with the London Library, looking at their members’ books and registers. We looked at John Stuart Mill, the politician and economist, who was
                    an active member and donated a number of books. Helen compiled a list of all the books he’d borrowed from and donated to the library, and then we used large scale computing to mine that against all the books he’d ever written. It was
                    like a historical Turnitin (a web-based plagiarism checker). It meant you could find the influence of a library on an individual through his books. But to do this you need to have those lists of books and then it’s all contingent on
                    having access to the full text of these books. At the moment you can only do that on pre-copyright years. The guillotine falls about 1910. You can’t study anyone after 1910 using that because we can’t get access to full text resources,
                    unless you digitise them all yourself. The Victorians are the people that you can study because that’s when you first have mass print that’s all out of copyright. You can’t do it on the Edwardians, you can’t do it on the second world
                    war. No way can you touch the 1940s. So, we couldn’t easily do that same study on Virginia Woolf (as some of her works are still under copyright in the UK, and so not available for text mining, unless we digitise them ourselves). One of Melissa’s recent projects used text mining to find mentions of professors and academics in children’s literature. It provides a good illustration of the problem. “I have a nice graph which is about the number of professors in children’s
                    books and from about 1850 it rises and rises because I’m able to do full text searches across Google books and the Internet Archive until you hit about 1910. Then it disappears because you can’t search in the same way. Your method has to change from doing full text searches across ­massive collections to actually doing a traditional bibliographic search, calling things up from the library and looking through yourself, and that limits scale to human.
                    It picks up again in 2010 because of Waterstone’s catalogue, ebay and ­Amazon. A similar issue would crop up if she attempted her current project in the 20th Century. The book will publish primary sources about women’s rights like
                    speeches. Here the text mining is used to hunt down references. “You take a speech from a Tuesday in February in 1890 and the speaker is talking about what a politician said last week – no name just ‘the honorable gentleman said...’ and the audience laugh. It’s like someone saying “Barnard Castle”
                    now. “In a hundred years you’ll go ‘what’s that?’ Without these resources, this mass digitised content to mine against, I would be lost. But you can only do this against large-scale digitised content, which is bounded by the copyright
                    frameworks.”
                 Melissa acknowledges the problem is not a simple one to solve. “I’m not saying for a minute we should ride roughshod over creators’ incomes. Similarly I don’t agree with those researchers and academics who think because something is out
                    of copyright they have a right to see it for free. “They need to be more respectful of libraries for looking after stuff for hundreds of years. I have dug up things where I’m probably the first person to see it for a 100 years. It doesn’t bother me that I have to pay a fee for that to
                    be digitised. The point is that I wouldn’t be able to find it without the stewardship of this library.” She wonders if institutions might benefit more from opening up and trusting people’s good will. “What you get in libraries, for example in the BL reading room, are signs saying ‘you can take pictures for your own studies but it’s illegal
                    to use them anywhere else’, perhaps they could say ‘if you are taking our out-of-copyright stuff and using it elsewhere you might want to contribute back to this institution…’.” She also acknowledges the organisations on the further reaches of the sector and suggests more support for them when they push boundaries that most cannot touch. “I love the Internet Archive and not just that they are pushing the envelope when it comes to copyright and permission and their cheekiness. They’ve built an incredible infrastructure that is amazing for researchers and I don’t think that
                    they get enough kudos. With their Emergency Library the voice of the publishers against them is very strong and we don’t have that same lobbying for researchers. But they’ve done some really interesting things, and have a completely
                    different attitude. I donate to the Internet Archive and to Wikipedia (and more people that use them should), or if I use an image or content from a library I make sure I make a donation. However, I realise this is a point of privilege,
                    that I have the resources to do so.” This all shows how aspects of copyright intersect with aspects of privilege, and how choices made regarding what is prioritised to be in the digitised environment is dependent on risk appetites,
                    affecting access for all. Melissa is still optimistic, though, about the potential of using digital approaches to study the past. “We’re only just getting started. And there’s so much more we – and the students and researchers coming
                    after us – will be able to do, given the digital cultural information environment is ever growing, as are the tools available to interrogate it.”                   News In depth Interview Insight       Benefits of CILIP membership";https://www.cilip.org.uk/news/557160/Why-is-most-of-the-20th-Century-invisible-to-AI.htm;

Adding a Digital Humanities bit to the OA book funding landscape: DARIAH is launching an annual OA monograph bursary for Early Career Researchers in Digital Humanities – Open Access Books Network;"Open Access Books Network A place to discuss Open Access books  This post, written by Dr. Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra, the Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU is an introduction to the next event in the ‘BoOkmArks: Open Conversations About OA Books’ series. A live session, open to all, will be held via this Zoom link on Tuesday 23rd March at 16:00 CET/ 15:00 GMT/11:00 ET, when we will interview Erzsébet about the DARIAH bursary for OA monographs for ECRs in Digital Humanities. If you have questions for Erzsébet, please add them to the comments section below so they can be included in the conversation on 23rd March — and join us at the event if you can! A recording will be available afterwards via our YouTube channel. “I went to a ‘publishing in the humanities’ day and the panel of academics were very keen on saying that they didn’t rely on impact factors but no one could answer a PhD student in the audience who wanted to know how you knew where to publish apart from ‘you just find out’.” (Em Nunn 2019, tweet) Exploring and supporting pathways to the open research culture for Arts and Humanities scholars is among the strategic commitments of DARIAH, and therefore we do our best to sufficiently address questions like the one above, and find solutions that fit best the specific circumstances of those who ask them. One of the most complex and most challenging scenarios that we regularly encounter in our open research and Open Access advocacy practice is finding pathways for publishing one’s first monograph Open Access. One source of difficulties is that in the current European OA funding landscape, we see a big gap that disproportionately and seriously affects those who wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. Although there is an increasing support from science funders to extend their OA mandates to books, and to cover the costs of Book Publishing Charges as parts of research grants, first monographs typically come from PhD dissertations, not externally funded research projects. Likewise, even though some of the research institutions have transformative agreements and/or institutional Open Access funds in place, these are not always available for non-permanent (or non-tenured) faculty members and even if so, they usually do not cover the whole publication charges (BPCs) of a monograph published in the book series that is topically the most relevant to Early Career Researchers (ECRs). Early Career Researchers under double pressure This gap in the OA funding structures is not the only difficulty ECRs are facing when they wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. A well-known and frequently voiced challenge is that due to the very strong influence of the  prestige economy on the current academic tenure and promotion criteria, in most cases, young scholars still need to choose between their academic career prospects vs. publishing in fair Open Access venues (and all the societal, economic and scholarly benefits that come with it). Therefore, it is clear that in parallel to our ongoing efforts and commitments of different kinds to change this situation for the better and enable the full transition of scholarly communication to responsible and community-driven means of Open Access on a systemic level,  we also need to provide immediate help to ECRs to enable them to start from a strong position in terms of formal assessment but also to practice their ethical devotion and establish themselves as scholars who significantly contribute  to the fair and open research culture. The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond.  The planned bursary is a very small step to this direction as we are planning to fund one monograph per year but hopefully in the future, other actors will be willing to form a coalition to support the initiative and make it bigger.  Small but immediate help with safeguards for fair Open Access To help scholars balance these conflicting expectations, we also need to strive for a balance between giving them freedom to publish their work OA at a venue of their choice based on topical relevance (e.g. in the book series their work would most naturally belong)  vs. preventing the DARIAH OA monograph fund from feeding profits of big, commercial players. To achieve this. Opening the discourse and coordinating with allies It is important to highlight that DARIAH’s efforts to help optimizing Open Access publishing to Arts and Humanities scholars’ needs are not becoming realized in an isolated space but instead, are embedded in a support network where sister infrastructures like OPERAS and actors from different sectors are joining forces and coordinate to make the most from both their individual and collective contributions to the responsible and open scholarly communication in the Social Science and Humanities. In a dedicated OA Books Network meeting, we would be honoured to lend the rich expertise of the OABN network and open up a consultation about specific details of the bursary to make sure that we do it right. In the broader context of challenges around publishing first monographs OA we wish to discuss: Implementation plan and the eligibility criteria of the funding program is expected to be published with the official call, to be launched in early April 2021.

Introduction to Digital Humanities is designed for researchers, teachers, and learners in humanities subject areas who wish to align their work with the field of digital humanities. Many institutions are encouraging digital approaches to the humanities, and this book offers guidance for students and scholars wishing to make that move by reflecting on why and when digital humanities tools might usefully be applied to engage in the kind of inquiry that is the basis for study in humanities disciplines. In other words, this book puts the ""humanities"" before the ""digital"" and offers the reader a conceptual framework for how digital projects can advance research and study in the humanities. Both established and early career humanities scholars who wish to embrace digital possibilities in their research and teaching will find insights on current approaches to the digital humanities, as well as helpful studies of successful projects.

Digital Humanities | Department of English | Nebraska;"in the Department of English Craig Chandler | University Communications The Department of English is an exciting place to study digital humanities. Our approach is shaped by the department’s commitment to imaginative reasoning, blending cutting-edge classroom-based instruction with experiential learning opportunities for students of all levels. Imaginative reasoning helps us “re-frame how we look at the world” in a critical way. We are also engaged in the department’s focus on social justice and anti-racist action, studying questions of race, gender, sexuality, and economics in our classrooms and research projects. Digital approaches to literature reframe the way we have traditionally seen, understood, analyzed, published, and preserved our cultural heritage. Scholarship in digital humanities, for example, tends to be collaborative rather than solitary in nature. The team-oriented approach means that questions larger than any one person could undertake can be addressed. And because many projects are web-based, the public is invited into the creation or reconsideration of cultural knowledge through our scholarly efforts. The Department is home to a range of cutting-edge digital work. Students in our department are immersed in digital archive building, computational text analysis, and textual scholarship to explore questions central to the study of literature across history and continents. Our composition and rhetoric faculty have expertise in digital writing environments and digital rhetoric. And our close relationship with the internationally recognized Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) allows students to engage in exciting Center-sponsored activities and to get a first-hand experience of complex digital humanities project development. We encourage you to jump into an exciting world where code grapples with art and faculty and students work together to create digital archives out of the materials of poets, scholars, journalists, explorers, and novelists. For more on DH in the Department of English, contact the current department DH coordinator, Stephen Ramsay, at sramsay2@unl.edu. Ph.D. 2020, UNL EnglishUS Latino Digital Humanities Post Doctoral Fellow, University of Houston “DH technology-based courses have given me opportunities to learn and apply text analysis and interpretation applications. Collaborative courses have provided project development and management opportunities to developing project proposals and work with the non profit community to create sustainable products and processes. “As a 2017 Digital Scholar Incubator (DSI) Fellow, I was able to craft an Omeka collection site and a Scalar multi-media site for the case study I am using for my dissertation. The time as a DSI, along with the exercises in ideation critical to the creative process, created a unique combination of time and space for intense interpretive experimentation and critique, now reflected in the rich and varied narrative of final Scalar site production. “Finally, I am a multi-modal scholar and teacher because I have implemented much of the technology and collaborative processes I learned through my DH courses. I integrate organic pedagogy with available technologies to provide my composition and rhetoric students a platform of new and exciting ways to explore and articulate complex ideas and texts. The methodologies DH offers continues to shorten the distance between the ways I can successfully construct and explore narrative ideas in the classroom and in my own scholarship.” Ph.D. Student, Department of English Claire Jiménez is a Puerto Rican writer who grew up in Brooklyn and Staten Island, New York. She is the author of Staten Island Stories (Johns Hopkins University Press), which received a NYC Book Award from the New York Society Library and was a finalist for the International Latino Book Awards. Jiménez is a PhD student in English, pursuing certificates in ethnic studies and digital humanities at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where she is also an assistant fiction editor for Prairie Schooner. She is a graduate of the MFA program in Fiction at Vanderbilt University.  In 2020, she received a Mellon Foundation grant from the U.S Latino Digital Humanities Program at the University of Houston to work with a team of scholars to develop a digital archive of Puerto Rican literature that she had begun as a Summer fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. With the help of USLDH, this project was later awarded the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Presidential Initiatives Grant, for which Jiménez is a Co-Principal Investigator. Her fiction, essays, and reviews have appeared in Remezcla, Afro-Hispanic Review, PANK, The Rumpus, el roommate, and Eater, among other publications. In our DH classrooms and in collaborative project settings, students can study a vast range of subjects: from the most innovative DH theories and technologies such as spectral imaging and text analysis to the nuts and bolts of grant writing and site development.

Our students pursue digital projects and careers equipped with an understanding of how their work shapes culture. Our digital humanities students aren't just doing projects—they're inventing them and leading them. We are helping Nebraska's students bring creativity to code, so that they can be innovators in an ever-shifting electronic world. Digital humanities faculty and students in the Department of English work closely with the university's distinguished Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH). Without the staff and resources of the Center, which is a joint initiative of the University Libraries and the College of Arts & Sciences, most of the Department of English projects listed above would not have been possible. The Center works with scholars and departments across the university, sponsors various activities related to digital humanities practice, and offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to hone their technical skills while taking part in cutting edge digital humanities research. For more on the Center, contact its co-directors Andrew Jewell at ajewell2@unl.edu and Kenneth Price at kprice2@unl.edu. The Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is an annual thematic exploration of issues in Digital Humanities. Sponsored by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and bringing speakers from institutions around the world, the Forum has been organized around topics like Social Justice and Cultural Memory, Video Games and the Humanities, and Digital Cultural Heritage. We offer students the opportunity to study the type of writing that underlies nearly all new media forms: namely, programming. The Graduate Certificate Program in Digital Humanities allows graduate and post-baccalaureate students to gain scholarly credentials in Digital Humanities. Work in this area can take a variety of forms, including: digital scholarly editing; the creation of thematic research archives and resources; programmatic analysis of large-scale textual corpora; the use of geo-spatial tools and technologies to study the interaction of people and place; data mining and machine learning techniques using historical data; 3D modeling of historical buildings and artifacts; tool building and software development for humanities research; and the creation of games, interactive environments, and media systems with a humanistic focus. Learn More Undergraduate English majors design their own concentration - a program of study based on their areas of interest, organized around a controlling theme or topic. Majors can design a concentration in digital humanities by meeting with their advisor. Learn More The minor in digital humanities offers a wide range of courses that allow students to explore how digital technologies alter our understanding of ourselves, our art, our history, and our culture. Students learn how to critically engage with digital media, and many courses introduce students to digital techniques for research, analysis, and publication. Each student gains experience with hands-on, creative digital work, and several courses provide students opportunities to conceive and build digital projects independently and with teams of other students. The range of electives available for the digital humanities minor, combined with frequent special topics courses that can easily be substituted in, means that students can find distinctive groups of courses that speak to their interests in literature, history, archeology, classics, art history, 3D modeling, text analysis, digital archives, and more. Graduates with a digital humanities minor are well prepared for a growing number of careers in industry, nonprofit, and educational sectors that welcome digital skills alongside the communication and critical thinking abilities that have long been valued in humanities students. Students have also gone on to pursue graduate work in the humanities, library science, and information science, among other disciplines. Learn More The students I work with on the Whitman Archive have reshaped our understanding of a cultural icon. I’m proud of their achievements—including new discoveries, published articles, NEH grants, and both alt-ac jobs and tenure-line professorships. Brett Barney is a research associate professor in the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and has been involved in the creation and maintenance of the Walt Whitman Archive since 2000. He served two terms on the technical council of the Text Encoding Initiative and is especially interested in encoding protocols that support the creation of documentary editions and the identification of various, complex relationships among documents and parts of documents. Matt Cohen is a contributing editor at the Walt Whitman Archive, where his projects include digitizing Whitman’s marginal annotations, building a visualizable handlist of reprints of Whitman’s poetry, and improving access to translations of Whitman’s work. That work informed his book Whitman’s Drift: Imagining Literary Distribution (University of Iowa Press, 2017). He is also a co-editor of the Charles W. Chesnutt Archive. Editor and writer Kwame Dawes is the editor of Prairie Schooner and the founder and director of the African Poetry Book Fund, the home of the African Poetry Digital Portal and several African poetry book series. Dawes’s scholarship is in post-colonial studies, African literature, Caribbean literature, and African American Literature. He won an Emmy for new approaches to news and documentary programming for LiveHopeLove.com, and has received grants from the Ford Foundation and the Mellon Foundation for digital humanities projects. Amanda Gailey’s research and teaching interests include nineteenth-century American literature, digital editing, and the sociopolitical implications of technology.  Andy Jewell is the director of the Willa Cather Archive, a large online archive and publisher of digital resources relating to the American author (like the Complete Letters of Willa Cather, debuting in January 2018). After years of experience creating a digital research collection, he seeks to explore connections between his DH work and public humanities programming, likely through new forms like community events and short films. Elizabeth Lorang co-directs Image Analysis for Archival Discovery, a cross-disciplinary, multi-institution project that seeks to leverage the information potential of digital images to enhance discovery and access to historic materials. She is also the co-editor of a digital edition of newspaper poetry from the Anglo-African and National Anti-Slavery Standard. Kenneth M.

Basics of Mapping for the Digital Humanities – IDRE Sandbox;http://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/basics-of-mapping-for-the-digital-humanities In the Humanities, mapping can be defined in so many different ways, there is no easy answer to these questions. In fact, your research can dictate the parameter of choices that define your map. Below are a few examples of just how multi-faceted mapping can be for the humanities, and how the digital can help scope and develop innovative approaches to projects. How then might your project utilize these tools? “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” -Waldo Tobler Waldo Tobler’s statement defines his first law of geography, in ways stating the obvious correlation between objects in space, paving the foundation behind spatial dependencies. Equally important, we may argue, is that the same dependencies that exist in space also exist in time. Chronology is a representation of sequential data as spatial overlays, often visualized to show relationships, dependencies, and causation through time. As mentioned at the top of the syllabus for this course, space and time are dimensions that are forever intertwined due to their ontological nature. So far, we have mastered the skills necessary to put objects onto an interactive map, but how then, can we combine the temporal dimension into our visual representation of our subject matter? More importantly, is temporality not the single most important component to complete our spatial narrative? The representation of 3 dimensional space onto a flat, 2 dimensional platform–a map–brings with it many challenges and compromises (e.g. projection systems). Every “flat” map in existence compromises on one geographical element: Shape, Area, Distance or Direction. So too, does the representation of the “fourth dimension”, or time, bring about much to contemplate on how best to summarize and eventually effectively visualize geo-temporal data. Historically, inventive methods employed in visualizing change over time has produced infamous graphics such as Minard’s map of Napoleon’s Russian Campaign in 1812.  Equally inventive and in ways revolutionary to the modern day digital world was the wizardry employed by the exuberant “Jedi Master of data visualization”, Hans Rosling. His legendary TED talk in 2006 was premised by a tool he created called Gapminder, later to be bought out by Google in 2007. As a data visualization tool, Gapminder cleverly incorporates temporal global data on a 2D bubble chart, utilizing choreographed animation sequences to depict change over time. Spatiality is defined by a bubble-per-country, and via the colors of the bubbles, each swath representing a geographic region. Yet, what makes this representation of information compelling is not just in its ability to animate data over time, but more so in its ability to interact with time, pausing, rewinding, forwarding, slowing down and speeding up.   I turn off Google Maps and start to drive. I wonder: what would it mean to drive downward, into the buried pasts that persist somewhere—in the imagination, in the archive, in the memories of others, in the traces of places long gone and lost? Who used to live here? What used to be there? What’s buried under this freeway, under this skyscraper, beneath these overpasses? What has vanished imperceptibly from the surface of the earth? What voices and ghosts haunt, however imperceptibly, these concrete landscapes? Why do I care? It’s a past which is, ostensibly, not my own. I don’t recognize it. It’s not mine. Time is out of joint. – Todd Presner (HyperCities, Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities) Perhaps one of the most innovative geotemporal platforms born and created within academia is HyperCities, the brainchild of our very own Todd Presner. In his words, here is how Todd describes the Hypercities platform: Built on the idea that every past is a place, HyperCities came to life as a digital research and educational platform for exploring, learning about, and interacting with the layered histories of city and global spaces. Developed though collaboration between UCLA, USC, CUNY, and numerous community- based organizations, the fundamental idea behind HyperCities is that all histories “take place” somewhere and sometime, and that they become more meaningful when they interact and intersect with other histories. Through the Google Maps and Earth APIs, HyperCities essentially allows users to go back in time to create, narrate, and explore the historical layers of city spaces and tell stories in an interactive, hypermedia environment. The idea that we can spiral downwards–or upwards–from any location to navigate into the past or future is at the core of the HyperCities platform, to the degree that technology can allow such a concept to manifest. The obvious choice to represent time via a web-based interface is to provide some sort of time dial, a time-machine of sorts that allows you to punch in a past (or future) date, and navigate to that time to present information relevant to that temporal space. Web-based time representations are made possible via a myriad of functional visual widgets. Most popular are the time sliders that allow users to navigate into the past by “sliding” a set of handles to go back (or forward) in time. Google Earth uses such a slider effectively to navigate time:  The advantage of dynamic time sliders is that they are malleable, they adjust to the time spans dictated by the content material. In the screen shot from Google Earth, the time slider itself is indicative of the content being provided, in this case, we can depict that this particular location has historical satellite image dating back to 1992. In the open source community, various temporal widgets have surfaced, none more prominent than the SIMILE Timeline Widget. Funded by the Mellon Foundation in 2003, Simile was a joint research project run by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and MIT CSAIL. Despite the fact that the project ended in 2008, the tool remains available and popular today–via open source channels–a testament to the longevity of well documented, interoperable and functional open source platforms. It also speaks to the difficulty of building time-based visualization platforms. The LA Times uses the SIMILE timeline to effectively show crime over time. Temporal platforms seemingly entered a lull after SIMILE, signaling an end of an era for innovations in time-based visualizations. Several notable libraries have emerged, most notably Timeline JS, produced by Northwestern Univesity’s Knight Lab, which capitalizes on the increased usage of cloud technologies by academics and journalists alike. Timeline JS capitulates on the popularity of Google Docs, cleverly utilizing the Spreadsheet API to link data directly into its visually appealing timeline, allowing one to manipulate data dynamically, effectively utilizing it as a database driving the web interface. However, its dependency on Google, coupled with the timeline’s inability to scale time beyond a single day.  Perhaps signaling a new wave of geotemporal platforms, CartoDB emerged onto the scene in 2012, when it’s platform was launched at the Where 2.0 conference. Unlike other emerging online mapping platforms such as Leaflet and Mapbox, CartoDB prides itself in its database driven mapping approach, built on an open source backend of PostGIS and PostGRESQL.  It may come as a surprise to conclude this segment on temporal visualization platforms with a little-known open source project called vis.js. While more prominent libraries such as D3 and Palladio have stolen the limelight in recent years, vis.js delivers as an all-encompassing, dynamic, visualization library. More intriguing is that unlike similar libraries that are born within academia, vis.js was created by an R&D team from a Dutch company Almende, whose mission is “to empower human beings to better organize their lives in an increasingly complex world”. Similar to the Simile project, vis.js offers several libraries for different visualization techniques. Their Timeline library offers to create “fully customizable, interactive timeline with items and ranges”. Perhaps the beauty lies in its lack of any spectacular looking interfaces. Rather, it focuses almost singularly on function… function that allows you to navigate through time–from milliseconds to decades–in a matter of yes, seconds. [full screen] Further, its claim as a “fully customizable” tool is justified by the ease of which in incorporates JSON data, allowing the timeline to co-exist with other visual components, such as maps. Now that you have a better understanding of the spatial and temporal components of a map, you may wonder how can I extract locations from my data? One way to do so is to use Google Fusion tables on data fields such as “Address” or “City Name”. First go to https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?dsrcid=implicit and import your CSV table (Sample Coin Data Set here):  Then click on next, after choosing your header row. To start the geocoding, go to “File” then “Geocode”: Finally, choose the field with your location data, it can be either city name, latitude/longitude, addresses, etc.  The geocoder will attempt to match the field to a coordinate then you can click on “Map” to view your results.  You can tell the Google Fusion Table to treat any field as a “Location” by clicking on the arrow next to the field header and clicking “Change”:  In this case we are going to make “NAT” (which is Nation) the location:  Now you can geocode it:  And there you have it!

#DayOfDH2020 at Brock University’s Centre for Digital Humanities | by Aaron Mauro | Medium;"Apr 29, 2020 Brock University is a public research institution in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. It sits perched atop the beautiful Niagara Escarpment overlooking the rocky shores of Lake Ontario. This bucolic setting is perfect for growing grapes and great digital humanities (DH) programs! Brock University has had a Centre for Digital Humanities since 2002! During that time, the CDH has always worked at the exciting intersection of interactive technologies and the humanities! For our Day of DH2020 blog post, we’d like to capture just a small glimpse of the work that our faculty, staff, and students do every day. Jason Hawreliak and Aaron Mauro will take turns describing our work and how it fits into the CDH. The surprising and wonderful thing about DH is how it takes on a local flavour wherever it is practiced. The local culture of Digital Humanities in the CDH has placed a strong emphasis on interactive media, including video games, data visualization, application development, and many others. It is a distinct brand of DH that is heavily influenced by the spirit and ethos of game development culture. The CDH at Brock is housed within Faculty of Humanities and is both a research and teaching centre. If pressed to summarize the culture of the CDH, we’d have to say that collaboration is part of everything we do. We host two academic programs, the Interactive Arts and Science and Game Design programs, both of which are generously supported through inter-departmental, inter-faulty, and even inter-institutional collaborations. Interactive Arts and Science enjoys great support from faculty across the Faculty of Humanities as well as from Brock’s own Computer Science program, within the Faculty of Mathematics and Science. Similarly, the Game program benefits from a great partnership with Niagara College Canada, which means our students receive both a college and university diploma. This deep collaboration between our neighbouring institutions allows our students to benefit from the superb, technically intensive, training of a college environment and the broader questions and critical training of a humanities degree. Our students are developers and storytellers. They are critics and makers. They are burgeoning creative professionals who are interested in questions of community and collaboration, but they are also having a blast while they do it! Our labs are expertly equipped to both develop and test games. Playtesting is a critical part of the development cycle, but it is also just a lot of fun. In some ways, playtesting is the moment when the critical and technical come together most. Students are trying to break things. They see where the failures are in the code and try to make them better. On that note, we’ll shift away from our “royal we” and give the stage to Jason so he can explain how games and DH work together! Hi, I’m Jason, and I’m the director at the CDH! Although I’m the director of a Centre for Digital Humanities, as a games researcher I have to admit I’ve never quite felt like a digital humanist. No one has ever said to me that games don’t belong in DH, but when most people think of DH (if they think of it at all!) game studies is probably not what they have in mind. When I’ve attended DH conferences or read DH articles, games are present, but usually as what seems like an aside. And when they are mentioned, it’s usually in the context of serious games, game-based learning, or gamification. My colleagues in the CDH, Alex Christie and Aaron Mauro, are digital humanists. They use digital technologies to engage with questions in the Humanities, such as textual interpretation and epistemology. It’s fantastic work and I marvel at it. Me, on the other hand? I study how videogames communicate meaning, primarily through the frameworks of semiotics and rhetoric. I’m interested in how games contribute to a wider rhetorical ecosystem that reinforces and contests worldviews, social norms, and ideologies. I more or less use the analytical tools I learned in my English Language and Literature degrees and apply them to interactive media. That feels decidedly less DH-y somehow. Part of the issue might be that I’m not much of a games practitioner. I do make small games occasionally, but mostly as a way to either a) maintain a conversational knowledge of development practices (which help me better understand my object of study), or b) teach introductory modules on game design to undergraduate students. In other words, making games is a complement to my research, but certainly not integral to it. Right or wrong, DH has always had the air of production to me; making is a necessary part of knowing (“less yack, more hack”), and that’s much less prominent in game studies (Elizabeth Losh has a fantastic article which deals with some of these issues in greater detail). My favorite definitions of DH are some version of “using digital technologies to study questions in the Humanities, and using Humanities frameworks to study digital technologies.” If we accept those, then game studies definitely counts! For the past few years my area of focus has been on multimodal communication, namely, how semiotic modes like text, image, music, and procedurality (systems) come together in games to convey potential meanings. More recently, I’ve narrowed in on the mode of olfaction and its potential applications in game design and research. How might the game equivalent of smell-o-vision be used in games? Products like the FeelReal VR accessory already exist, and researchers have been studying olfaction in games for a while. But I’m interested in olfaction as part of a broader multimodal “ensemble” in games. How might scents be used in conjunction with images and sounds to create compelling experiences? Or perhaps more importantly, how might scents be used to make games more accessible? Olfactory games aren’t likely to become mainstream hits, but at the very least this avenue of study forces us to think beyond the predominantly visual and auditory modes of communication in games. Hi everyone, I’m Aaron. I’m new to the CDH, and I’ve found fast friends and colleagues here. Since arriving at Brock and finding myself in a new DH culture, I’ve found myself translating the dialects of DH that I’ve known in the past to this wonderfully vibrant, game centred community that embraces interactive media so completely. I feel a little like this classic old promo video for Microsoft SQL servers. In this odd little piece of computing history, Bill Gates and Ed Esber demonstrate different front end applications for accessing “the same data” from the same SQL server. Warning: I’m going to stretch this metaphor, so stay with me. Jason and I are accessing the same DH using different front end methodologies, but our underlying approach to DH (this part is the server metaphor bit) is the same. “It’s the same DH!” Okay, so maybe I took it too far, but I like to think this dorky video says something about how a simple database can help describe our research. On a very fundamental level, we are thinking about our human relationships through technology. My research has two dominant areas at present, which I see has being intimately linked. With that said, I’m also making comparisons between SQL databases and research methodologies, so maybe I see tangential connections more than most. I am working on a monograph called Cybersecurity and the Humanities, which is a cyberpunk infused romp through all the cybersecurity issues facing us in the 21st century. I’m taking lessons learned from speculative fiction about technology and thinking about how the humanities can inform cybersecurity practices and policy. I’m also thinking about how cybersecurity best practices might offer humanists a new framework for thinking about issues relating to justice, equality, and democracy. The other half of my work has to do with data visualization and natural language processing or NLP. I use NLP techniques every day in developing different penetration tests or social engineering experiments, so I like to think these two halves of my DH practice align easily. Anyway, I’m working to explore the complete print run of the Encyclopedia Britannica using NLP methods. The corpus represents some 15 editions, across 244 years of print history. There have been the typical trials and tribulations with OCR. There have been issues with access to original materials, some of which we scanned by hand! Despite these problems and the time they take to correct, the project has gone remarkably smoothly because of the maturity of the Python data science technology stack, which includes great graphing, machine learning, and distributed computation tooling. I’ve collected the current project findings on this site, and I’ll be making updates shortly. By far, the biggest problem I’ve faced has been visualizing such a large, nuanced data set. I’ve wanted to explore complex relationships between the evolution of terms and “ideas” across all 244 years. I wanted to see the evolution of concepts from the height of the European Enlightenment until the 21st century. I wanted to understand how pernicious and damaging ideas became something like general knowledge. How have questions of race, gender, and class been codified as something generally known to be true? How could damaging and regressive ideas evolve into a state of “givenness” that generations of readers would accept these ideas as unquestionably true? In order to show these complex relationships, I turned to Blender to develop 3D visualizations. These 3D visualizations allow me to “fly” through the data and explore the original content of the each node. Because Blender has a fantastic Python API, it can be linked up with all my great Python data science tools! This system is already giving new insights that would not have been possible using standard visualization libraries. The next step will be to render these visualizations in a VR/AR headset and allow the user a fully immersive experience. The goal with this work is to make these complex visualizations interactive and intuitive. I want to explore data. I want to allow for an experiential quality for data analysis that allows for intuition and aesthetics to factor into making observations and making new discoveries! I want to bring the human sense of awe and wonder into data visualization! And we’re back! We had a lot of fun sharing some of our work on Day of DH 2020! With just two examples, we hope we’ve shown how two very different approaches to DH can be united through interactive media. Interactive media represents an experiential relationship with technology that does not minimize or reduce human creative and critical capacities. Games ask us to play; we test and probe a game to bend and break rules; games ask us to be creative in solving problems and telling stories. The human desire to explore and test the limits of technology seems to be a critical focus for those of us working within the Centre for Digital Humanities at Brock University.

Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities – punctum books;"Earth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2021. 512 pages, illus. ISBN-13: 978-1-953035-57-8. DOI: 10.53288/0274.1.00. OPEN-ACCESS e-book and $27.00 in print: paperbound/5 X 8 in.

Schlund-Vials, Siobhan Senier, Ravynn K. Stringfield Published: 06/24/2021 In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes that by examining the process of history we can “discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.” Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities examines the process of history in the narrative of the digital humanities and deconstructs its history as a straight line from the beginnings of humanities computing. By discussing alternatives histories of the digital humanities that address queer gaming, feminist game studies praxis, Cold War military-industrial complex computation, the creation of the environmental humanities, monolingual discontent in DH, the hidden history of DH in English studies, radical media praxis, cultural studies and DH, indigenous futurities, Pacific Rim postcolonial DH, the issue of scale and DH, the radical, indigenous, feminist histories of the digital database, and the possibilities for an antifascist DH, this collection hopes to re-set discussions of the straight, white origin myths of DH. Thus, this collection hopes to reexamine the silences in such a straight and white masculinist history and delineates how power comes into play to shape this straight, white DH narrative. A number of the pieces in this volume go back to the origin myth of the digital humanities to reassess the hagiography of Father Busa by reconsidering and recontextualizing his legacy and his work in relation to media archaeology, politics, Cold War maneuvers, mechanized genocide, the Third Reich, and the military-industrial complex as it has organized various fields, including Asian Studies. This reassessment of comparative genealogies — vis-à-vis Foucault — undergirds an alternative history of the Jesuit hagiography we have so far been unwilling to reexamine for its narrative use in embellishing an origin hagiography/historiography for digital humanities. Other pieces intertwine the digital humanities with other fields — area studies, Asian American Studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and environmental studies — in order to reexamine how the intersections and juxtapositions reveal silences in these histories. And finally, a number of pieces considers alternative praxes in rethinking these histories, whether it is an essay that is a game or a reevaluation of feminist media praxis.

Uncovering the Many Eric Hobsbawms;" Our latest edition is out in print and online. Subscribe today and start reading. Eric Hobsbawm's work spanned everything from jazz to the history of banditry, in thousands of texts he wrote in several languages. A new project has brought together his writings in a searchable database — offering readers a goldmine of work by Britain's greatest Marxist historian. British Marxist historian and sociologist Eric Hobsbawm in Carpi, Italy, 2006. (Leonardo Cendamo / Getty Images) Have you read Jacobin in print? Subscribe at a special rate and don’t miss our latest edition. Until recently, anyone with a scholarly interest in Eric Hobsbawm would sooner or later be told to contact Keith McClelland. The reason was simple: He held the (virtual) keys to an extraordinary document — a PDF file that contained details of almost everything Hobsbawm ever wrote. It ran to over a hundred thirty pages and included details of multiple editions, translations, and a dizzying array of cross-references. It was — and still is — an unprecedented visualization of Hobsbawm’s productivity and commercial success. The story behind this remarkable document goes back to the early 1980s. At the time, some of Hobsbawm’s students and colleagues prepared an edited volume to celebrate his retirement from Birkbeck College, London. As the two editors — Raphael Samuel and Gareth Stedman Jones — started to put the book together, they realized that one way to mark Hobsbawm’s contribution was to commission someone to prepare a comprehensive bibliography of his writings. They invited Keith, then a labor historian and frequent attendee at Hobsbawm’s Social History seminar at London’s Institute of Historical Research, to undertake the work. Even in the early 1980s, this was an enormous task. Hobsbawm had published numerous books — single-authored and edited — and he had been involved in myriad editorial projects, ranging from the historical journal Past & Present to the multiauthor, multi-volume Storia del marxismo (History of Marxism) series, instigated by the Italian publisher Einaudi. Most of all, he had published a bewildering number of essays, articles, and reviews across a range of international publications. It is worth remembering that there was no Internet to help track down esoteric references. Keith could not turn to Project Muse or Google Books. Instead, he had to rely on the index cards of the British Library in London and Hobsbawm’s own imperfect memory. He spent long hours in the Hobsbawm residence on Nassington Road in North London chasing publication dates, identifying forgotten cross-references, and classifying unexpected translations. The end result was a thirty-page bibliography, published in 1982 as the final chapter of the edited volume Culture, Ideology and Politics: Essays for Eric Hobsbawm. It was a milestone in the world of Hobsbawm studies. For the first time, it was possible to track ideas across different texts, formats, and, in some cases, languages. Keith’s decision, taken in collaboration with the editors, to group writings by theme revealed trends and clusters that would otherwise have remained hidden. The problem was, there was still a lot more Hobsbawm left to come after 1982. He had not even published the third part of his “Ages” tetralogy — Age of Empire came out in 1987 — let alone the hundreds of articles, lectures, book chapters, op-eds, and interviews that accompanied the publication of Age of Extremes in 1994 and his memoir, Interesting Times, in 2003. This incessant production meant that Keith was continuously in the process of adding to his bibliography. The most substantial revision came in 2010, when he was invited by Eric and Marlene Hobsbawm to take stock of everything that had appeared since 1982. The bibliography mushroomed as he catalogued hundreds of new texts, many of which were associated with Hobsbawm’s newfound status as a public intellectual. Keith added entire categories to the bibliography — like “globalization” — absent from the 1982 edition. Hobsbawm died in 2012, but even this was not enough to stem the tide. Several collections of his essays were published posthumously, and interviews, lectures, and TV appearances continued to surface online. Moreover, the decision to deposit Hobsbawm’s papers in the Modern Records Centre archive at the University of Warwick opened a rich additional angle for a bibliography. It would soon be possible to compare Hobsbawm’s published and unpublished writings, as well as his private diaries, scattered correspondence, and dozens of research notebooks. The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography — which began in 2019 as part of a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council project on Hobsbawm’s intellectual biography — was initially conceived as an attempt to bring order to this increasingly chaotic bibliographical landscape. The aim was simple: We wanted to convert the most recent version of Keith’s bibliography into an open-access database, to which we would add the complete catalogue of Hobsbawm’s archive. This would then form the basis of a multilingual website that would allow anyone to search the bibliography according to a range of criteria. To preserve the spirit of Keith’s original bibliography, we also wanted to create curated lists of publications grouped under certain thematic headings, such as “Capitalism: origins, development, results,” “Jazz,” and “Labour history.” These would provide ready-made reading lists for those looking for Hobsbawm’s thoughts on a particular subject. Given that much of the hard work had already been done by Keith over the past thirty years, we expected it to be a straightforward task to convert his bibliography into a flexible digital format. Nothing could have been further from the truth. For a start, we faced endless technical challenges. Our coding wizard, Richard Hadden, struggled heroically to convert obsolete or proprietary formats into an easily accessible XML database. Nevertheless, formatting went missing, numbering systems broke halfway through sequences, and inconsistencies in presentation that passed without notice in the paper version of the bibliography were ruthlessly exposed by the exigencies of programming. We also found ourselves asking difficult conceptual questions about how our database should be organized and presented. Which should take priority in search results: the form of a publication (book, article, review, etc.) or the date of publication? Should monographs always appear higher in search results than other kinds of publication, thereby suggesting that they are the most valuable form of intellectual output? What is the proper relationship between an original text and its translations? Should the Spanish version of the website display Spanish-language translations above the English originals? In the case of texts that underwent substantial revisions, which should be the “master” version: the original or the latest edition? Most historians, librarians, and archivists are used to making these snap judgements as a matter of course — and the answers are usually complex and context-specific. But building a database and search engine is unforgiving; programming languages work according to rational, hierarchical rules. It is possible to build in fuzzy logic or clever algorithms, but some hard decisions have to be made. Incorporating unpublished material led to further issues. Our intention was to connect Hobsbawm’s papers to his published output, whether through curated lists or as links within a particular entry. In this way, someone interested in the reception and response to one of Hobsbawm’s books could start with the book itself and then move on to associated correspondence, reviews, or contractual details. But what is the status of an unpublished manuscript draft? Should it appear alongside the published book? And what counts as “associated” material? Early conference papers? Research notebooks? These questions have been the subject of intense debate by intellectual historians and scholars of political thought. We had to choose one of two answers: “yes, this belongs” or “no, let’s leave it out.” The finished product, then, turned out to be rather different than what had come before. We retained the architecture of the 1982 bibliography, but our discussions and additions transformed a static reference document into a vast and flexible database, which included outbound links to journal repositories like JSTOR and the WorldCat international library catalogue. When it went live in late 2020, the Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography became the most comprehensive and complex record of Hobsbawm’s writings currently available. When we began the process of building the new bibliography, we imagined that it would serve as a useful tool for further research on Hobsbawm and his generation of Marxist intellectuals. By making his back catalogue accessible to anyone with an internet connection, we wanted to help our colleagues, our students, and anyone interested in Hobsbawm. It was conceived as an exercise in professional service. Yet the process of compiling and revising the bibliography simultaneously revealed vital aspects of Hobsbawm’s intellectual biography, most of which have not been probed in any depth. The first and surely the most striking aspect of the bibliography is its size. The database contains more than three thousand entries. Almost all of these refer either to individual texts authored by Hobsbawm or archival boxes that contain drafts, notes, and correspondence (the latter is very fragmentary). Most reviewers and commentators have remarked on Hobsbawm’s productivity, but this bibliography lays bare its sheer scale. It would be no exaggeration to say that he was obsessed with the written word. From his earliest teenage writings to his political interventions in his nineties, everything was mediated through text. He wrote quickly, fluently, and often in one take. Regardless of the subject matter — and there were many of them — the words poured onto the page. At no point in his career does he seem to have suffered from serious writer’s block. Rather, he continued to write even through some of his most difficult personal circumstances. He kept a diary for several years as an orphaned teenager in London; he maintained a handsome portfolio of book reviews and jazz criticism as his first marriage collapsed in the early 1950s; he processed the trauma of the Communist schism of 1956 by researching and writing Primitive Rebels; and he tried to understand the terminal decline and collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and ’90s by writing endless numbers of books, articles, and essays. For Hobsbawm, writing was more than a by-product of an intellectual life; it was an intensely personal act of communication. At the same time, his bibliography shows just how well he mastered an essential academic skill: the art of repetition. He was an expert in repackaging his ideas. Student lectures became book chapters; newspaper op-eds became long essays; and key arguments found their way into a myriad of different formats. Hobsbawm was a strikingly original thinker. The range of concepts for which he became known — including the “dual revolution,” “primitive rebellion,” “invented traditions,” and “the short twentieth-century” — indicate a restless mind. But his productivity was also the result of a willingness to recycle his greatest hits. This tendency was reinforced by his international success. One of the most difficult parts of the bibliography was identifying translations, some of which were unauthorized. Transliteration of titles was often unstandardized, and therefore search engines did not always successfully detect their publication details. Separating bogus from legitimate references was a painstaking task, but it means that the database now contains the most reliable record of Hobsbawm’s international reach. We tracked hundreds of publications that were translated into at least one other language. Especially impressive were the number of translations of some of his most famous books: we identified twenty-four translations of The Age of Revolution (1962) and The Age of Capital (1987); twenty-seven translations of Nations and Nationalism Since 1780: Programme, Myth, Reality (1990); and no less than thirty-one translations of The Age of Extremes (1994). The circulation of texts in other languages multiplied the impact of his writings. In most cases, Hobsbawm had little or no input into a translation — and we know from his correspondence that he sometimes complained about the quality of the text in languages he could understand. But the truth was that each translation expanded his potential market. Without coming up with new ideas, he could reach new audiences. The written word was his passport to global fame. This virtuous circle could work the other way, too. In some cases, he trialed ideas and arguments in non-English publications before introducing them to his English-language audience. This was especially true of his writings and interventions in Italy. In the 1950s and ’60s, he explored the relevance of Antonio Gramsci in Italian before incorporating some of these ideas into his English-language work in subsequent decades. Later, in the early 1970s, he used the left-wing Italian press to develop key ideas about the future of the labor movement that he then applied to the British Labour Party after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. Another consequence of this dense web of translated texts was a time lag in the reception of Hobsbawm’s ideas. This is clearly visible in the bibliography. Translations often appeared years — sometimes decades — after the original English text. One of the best examples of this is the translation of Hobsbawm’s classic articles on the “transition debate” and his essays on labor history, most of which were originally published in English in the 1950s and ’60s. These only appeared in Spanish and Portuguese in the 1970s. The time lag pulled Hobsbawm back to questions and themes on which he had written almost nothing for many years. The staggered temporalities of translation meant that he could cash in on his fame without actually producing new work. It goes without saying that Hobsbawm’s commercial savvy is amply documented in his bibliography. For a career academic, he navigated the business of publishing with remarkable assurance. As a young scholar, he did a good deal of journalistic writing, for which he almost always received some kind of fee. Whether in the form of book reviews for the Times Literary Supplement or articles on jazz for the New Statesman, he was clearly focused on making a living from his craft. He went one step further in 1959, when he signed a contract with David Higham, one of Britain’s most formidable literary agents. This guaranteed ever more lucrative book deals and allowed him to keep close control on the sale of foreign rights. It helped that his generalist historical writing hit the market at a time in the 1960s and ’70s when demand for cheap paperbacks was soaring. He quickly became one of the lucky few academics who was able to make money from something that was also central to his intellectual identity. Beyond Hobsbawm himself, the bibliography speaks to the shape of both the historical profession and left-wing intellectual life in postwar Europe. One of the most obvious points is that these were overwhelmingly male spaces. There are vanishingly few women listed in the bibliography. They do not appear much as coeditors, collaborators, or even subjects of research. Even the interviews listed in the database are invariably with men or by men. Some women, such as academic and fellow Communist Margot Heinemann, clearly had an important influence on Hobsbawm, but their absence in the database raises questions about their absence in his writings. The days and weeks of childcare that enabled Hobsbawm to travel to international conferences with two young children at home in the 1960s was also a precondition for his voluminous published output. When some of his female students took him to task for neglecting women’s history in the late 1970s, they were not simply fighting a historiographical battle. They were also pushing back against an intellectual world overwhelmingly led by men who relied on the hidden labor of their wives, assistants, and secretaries. The hundreds of cross-references in the bibliography also reflect the importance of intellectual and political contacts. Hobsbawm’s professional universe was made up of a dense web of overlapping international networks that steadily expanded over time. At each stage of his career, the things he published were a result of personal connections with magazine editors, old Cambridge alumni, foreign academics, and political activists. When he was an apprentice historian in the late 1940s and early ’50s, his publications reflected his limited reach, which only stretched as far as British labor historians and economic historians, and a handful of French historians connected to the Annales school. By the 1970s, he was publishing a lot of material in places he had visited in previous years: He was a regular contributor to left-wing Italian newspapers and journals, and he was being translated into Spanish and Portuguese for dissemination across Latin America. Like most intellectuals, his professional networks were unevenly distributed. By the time he died, his books and articles were easily accessible in the Americas, Western Europe, and South Asia. But the paucity of translations into Eastern European or Asian languages, let alone any major African language, indicate those regions where his ideas did not reach a wide audience. It is surely no coincidence that these were also the regions that received the least coverage in his work. Hobsbawm’s bibliography stands as a stark reminder that the subjects scholars choose to write about are, in most cases, determined by who they know and where they have been. The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography was intended as a tool for understanding the published corpus of one of the world’s best-known Marxist historians. However, the digitization and compilation process also revealed the ways that intellectual capital was built and sustained in the second half of the twentieth century. It was not Hobsbawm’s intrinsic genius that made him a superstar; it was his combination of strategic networking, commercial intelligence, and facility with the written word. Focusing on the physical infrastructure of Hobsbawm’s writings is a reminder to scholars of intellectual life that the form in which ideas are packaged is almost as important as the content. And this is surely just as true in the age of Twitter as it was during the golden age of the mass-market Penguin paperback. Emile Chabal is a reader in history at the University of Edinburgh. He works on twentieth-century European political and intellectual history, with a special interest in France. Anne Perez is a historian based in Mobile, Alabama.

VIRTUAL IAS Festival: Making (in) the Digital Humanities | Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) - UCL – University College London;"Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) 
              05 May 2021, 3:00 pm–4:30 pm             With Alda Terracciano, Paul Fyfe, Julianne Nyhan and Adam Crymble. This event is free. Please join the IAS Virtual Forum here for the event.  Often accused of lacking theoretical basis and insight, acts of making in the Digital Humanities are in many ways misunderstood. Recently scholarship is showing the kinds of making and modelling that the Digital Humanities engages in—including, but not limited to, digitisation and imaging; coding and semantic enrichment; interpretative modelling with immersive technologies; and the humanistic fabrication of lost or poorly understood historical objects—to be rich, complex and sometimes even dark processes. Digitisations, for example, have recently been explored as complex sites, where labour, infrastructure, affect, funding, ideology, and more, shape digital resources in configurations that are often not detectable on the surface level of the shiny interface. So too, the objects that Digital Humanities creates, the digital infrastructures that it harnesses and the physical devices that it uses, are increasingly understood to partake of, and give rise to, deeply problematic asymmetries of the wider digital ecosystem: like the racialised and devalued labour forces that underpin it, the economies of exploitation that operate through platform capitalism or the environmental impact of server farms and cryptocurrency mining. In this way, making can be understood as occupying a complex role in the Digital Humanities, it can be a site of, or be implicated acts of liberation and oppression; creativity and constriction. Making in the Digital Humanities can be used to create or imagine new worlds and / or reamplify the worst tendencies of the digitally-mediated world we already have. This panel will reflect on the central role that making plays in the Digital Humanities, where the endeavour to know, imagine and explore through making is both distinctive to Digital Humanities itself and a potentially innovative epistemological contribution to the wider Humanities. It will ask: What is ‘making’ in the Digital Humanities? What frameworks and perspectives can we use for thinking-through the act of making in the Digital Humanities in all its complexity? What are the implications and complicities of making in the present context and how can Digital Humanities respond to this? And what of making in the wider Humanities – how is Digital Humanities advancing or problematizing this? Participants: Alda Terracciano, Paul Fyfe, Julianne Nyhan (chair) and Adam Crymble (chair) This talk forms part of the IAS fifth anniversary festival on the theme of ‘Alternative Epistemologies’.

Tom Lippincott receives primary appointment from Krieger School of Arts and Sciences - Center for Language and Speech Processing;"Assistant Research Professor and Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) member Tom Lippincott has received a primary appointment in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. Starting on July 1, Lippincott will assume the position of Director of Digital Humanities for the Alexander Grass Humanities Institute (AGHI). He will also hold secondary appointments in the Department of Computer Science and Human Language Technology Center of Excellence. Previously, Lippincott held a secondary appointment with AGHI, where he already has collaborations underway with faculty in the departments of English, History, and Near Eastern Studies. “It was tremendously gratifying to learn that scholars in the humanities find our interactions to be as compelling and productive as I do, to the point of committing the resources that made this possible,” Lippincott said. “It reflects a sort of trust and endorsement that’s critical for interdisciplinary research.” The goal of Lippincott’s research is to develop machine learning techniques that help scholars find interesting patterns in primary sources that may be obscured by normal practices of the field or fundamental limitations of human cognition. Lippincott believes that AI can help historians sift through great quantities of information to tease out and make connections that humans might miss. Lippincott’s passion for this research began during his undergraduate education at University of Chicago, when he noticed that his interest in humanistic domains – such as literature, poetry, history, and philosophy – was paired with a fundamentally computational way of thinking. “That basic observation has guided my research trajectory ever since, and I’m excited to see what insights the computational perspective brings when applied to some of our most-venerated cultural artifacts,” Lippincott said. “Machine learning for scholarship in the humanities is limited by how disruptive collaborations can be to both research communities. Participating in them simultaneously will provide a valuable window into how these disruptions can be mitigated, misunderstandings avoided, and collaborations fostered.” Lippincott plans to remain an active member of the CLSP community, and hopes that this appointment can help expand the center’s research capabilities. Center Director Hynek Hermansky certainly sees it that way, and is excited by what Lippincott’s new appointment could bring to CLSP. “Computational linguistics is traditionally not applied that much in humanities research, and Tom’s expertise can make a lot of difference there,” Hermansky said. “So, speaking for CLSP, we are excited that Tom’s new appointment is opening this new area in language processing for us.” Lippincott says that being at Hopkins has been a big factor in his ability to pursue this work, mentioning the practicality and research vision of both the Whiting School of Engineering and KSAS and the enthusiastic engagement from graduate students and faculty at both schools as being immensely helpful. The ability to collaborate and conduct research with fellow CLSP members has also played a crucial role in Lippincott getting to this point. “The CLSP, in my mind, is what makes this endeavor possible,” Lippincott said. “There are only a handful of places in the world that have drawn together so many exceptional researchers in NLP, and areas like knowledge base construction, optical character recognition, crowdsourcing, and natural language understanding have direct use-cases in the humanities.” 
There are no upcoming events.

Home;Technology is global, but where we live affects how we apply digital solutions to humanities work. We all have what Roopika Risam described as a digital humanities (DH) “accent”. This seminar series explores those accents by looking at DH research here, and there, and over there too. This is a chance to build greater global awareness and empathy about regional and local approaches to digital humanities in the twenty-first century. It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed differently around the globe, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots. This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon our successful “Digital Humanities Long View” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice. Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford. Convenors: Drs Agnieszka Backman (Uppsala), Giovanna Ceserani (Stanford), Adam Crymble (UCL), Nick Fenech (Stanford), Anna Foka (Uppsala), Julianne Nyhan (UCL), Laura Stokes (Stanford), Clelia Rose La Monica (Uppsala).;https://cestastanford.github.io;

The Disappearance of Books Threatens to Erode Fine Arts Libraries;"Hyperallergic 
					Sensitive to Art & its Discontents				 Posters outside the Doty Fine Arts Building at the University of Texas at Austin (photo by and courtesy Abigail Sharp) Public libraries are experiencing a surge in use that few could have predicted even a decade ago. This renaissance has renewed interest in the library as a space for access to books, to technology, and to art. But libraries are no longer solely filled with books. Many are shifting to become multi-use and more digitally driven spaces. Yet as libraries create access to a digital future, the books that have traditionally inhabited them are being displaced at an alarming rate. This leaves many asking: Does acceptance of digital resources mean that the books must go? And what is at stake when artists, art historians, students, and the public can no longer engage in the act of browsing the stacks as part of the process of creating and researching art? While the philosophical debate over what a library should be rages across the country and beyond, some institutions are shifting from philosophy to action, removing books to make way for other initiatives. At the University of Texas at Austin, around 75,000 fine arts books, journals, and other materials have already been moved by the College of Fine Arts and the University of Texas Libraries, as Hyperallergic reported in December. Many of the removed materials now reside in an off-site location near UT’s J.J. Pickle Research Campus or the Texas A&M joint library storage facility. At many libraries, the prime real estate occupied by books is being requisitioned to make way for new digital humanities initiatives like virtual reality experiences or “Makerspaces” cordoned off for 3D printing. In the case of UT-Austin’s Fine Arts Library, books and other analog materials were removed to accommodate a new space called The Foundry. As the mission page for the collaborative space notes, this is a joint initiative of the University of Texas Libraries and the College of Fine Arts meant to be available to all UT students, faculty, and staff. Yet the success of such 3D printing labs is often precarious and dubious. As many librarians and digital humanists have pointed out, installing a Makerspace in your library is not a panacea. A 3D-printed version of the Temple of Vesta in Rome from within the Copy + Paste 3D printing lab in the architecture gallery at the Carnegie Museum of Art (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) The most effective 3D printing labs in fact work in tandem with visible art — original or reproduced — in order to show students the relationship between objects and their replicated form. This is certainly the case at the Carnegie Museum of Art’s new Copy + Paste makerspace embedded in the Hall of Architecture. However, removing books, special collections, and other primary materials from a library space often removes essential sources of inspiration from students’ immediate view. At UT-Austin, the curators of the Blanton Museum of Art have expressed their displeasure with the current and future plans for the Fine Arts Library, noting in a letter to the dean of the College of Fine Arts, Doug Dempster: “Having timely access to the collection of the Fine Arts Library is essential to our mission of providing intellectually rigorous and engaging museum content to our audiences at the University and in the wider community.” The Blanton Museum, the Fine Arts Library, and academic departments at UT-Austin work in tandem to inform students and the general public about fine art. “The Foundry” space in the Fine Arts Library at UT-Austin (photo by and courtesy Rabun Taylor) The Foundry, it turns out, was only the first stage in a plan that has developed into a complete takeover of the Fine Arts Library. In 2017, an entire floor of books was swept away almost overnight, without consultation of faculty or students, to make way for a new high-tech design program, the School of Design and Creative Technologies. Dean Dempster offered a glimpse of the vision for this new design school in a talk at the 2018 SXSW Interactive Conference, suggesting that “fine” arts is an anachronism and should yield primacy to more entrepreneurial, STEM-oriented creative arts such as video game design. Unable to find space to accommodate the School of Design and Creative Technologies, or to raise capital for a new building, Dempster seized the fourth floor of the Fine Arts Library last summer. According to numerous sources Hyperallergic spoke to, he then announced both verbally and in emails his intention to relocate the rest of the library’s collection — an estimated 200,000 items — and appropriate the fifth and largest floor of the Doty Building for the nascent school. This was a bridge too far for faculty and students, who have organized a movement to save what remains of the Fine Arts Library. In the meantime, all plans for the library’s future have been put on hold and a working group led by UT Libraries is evaluating alternative solutions to the current impasse.

William Doty Fine Arts Building (photo by and courtesy Abigail Sharp) The University of Texas at Austin isn’t the only large public university planning to do away with its art library. The University of Wisconsin Library System has recently released a Facilities Master Plan, which proposes to eliminate the Kohler Art Library by 2030. Like UT-Austin, UW-Madison is planning to slash the overall number of books available on campus, in this case to 15% of the total collection. The Kohler Art Library’s holdings would eventually be reduced by 50%, with the other half moved off-site. UW-Madison’s Vice Provost for Libraries and University Librarian, Edward V. Van Gemert, echoes UT-Austin Dean Dempster’s reasoning for the reduction in browsable books, saying: “The vision of the plan is to strengthen the role of campus libraries in the academic pursuits of the University by providing the needed spaces and services at strategic locations across campus in alignment with campus planning.” Across the country, many university libraries are engaged in a book purge. This has meant reassessing the use of library spaces and consolidating book holdings in a bid to attract more visitors. In states like Missouri and Kansas, libraries have begun to spend more and more of their annual budgets on digital subscriptions and spaces for people, rather than on the acquisition of physical books. As in Austin and Madison, such shifts have often been met with resistance. At Syracuse University in New York, there was a faculty uproar over the proposed movement of books to a far-away warehouse. The struggle ultimately resulted in the university building a 20,000-square-foot storage facility nearby for over 1 million books — guaranteeing next-business-day delivery. With space at a premium and books ever-multiplying, how can we continue to make the case for browsable libraries dedicated to fine arts on major research campuses across the United States? University of Texas sophomore Abigail Sharp (a Corporate Communication major with a minor in Art History who is working on a certificate in Museum Studies) perhaps put it best. “The numerous irrelevant, algorithmically selected results from an online database do not compare to the titles found so close to one another when wandering the stacks of the library,” she told me. “Some of the best research and learning materials I’ve come across have been analog, and physically holding and flipping through print makes all the difference in learning and retention. There is a way to incorporate the new design major with the current Fine Arts Library and Building, and that does not require relocation of analog resources.” Before there was 3D printing, there were plaster casts. The Blanton Museum of Art has a number of classical casts that professors and curators teach with in tandem with the Fine Arts Library’s reserves. (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) Students and professors on campus at the University of Texas at Austin have not accepted the initial phases of the School of Design and Creative Technologies takeover without pushback and are working to halt the final phase of Dean Dempster’s plan. A petition on Change.org already has thousands of signatures from local, national, and international scholars and students hoping to save the Fine Arts Library, and the campus has been fully canvassed with posters and activists in the past few weeks. On Monday, the UT-Austin Faculty Council voted to adopt a resolution protesting Dean Dempster’s actions, while students picketed and leafleted the campus in protest of the plan. Many might ask why it is so important to save a few books that can simply be recalled from storage if one really needs them. However, to many at the University of Texas, the University of Wisconsin, and other large universities across the country, this fight is about maintaining the close links between research, art, and the visceral act of discovery in the stacks. The digital future should indeed be embraced, but books are a technology that should be just as readily available as a 3D printer or VR headset to the artists of tomorrow. Update, 3/28/2018: According to a UT-Austin spokesperson and the school’s FAQ page on the issue, there is now no current plan to close the Fine Arts Library or remove its materials from the Doty Fine Arts Building. This week, a mural in Belarus is a symbol of defiance, an excellent report about the 2020 election big lie, Chomsky and the dangers ahead, if you like Wordle, you might enjoy Heardle, and much more.

 How devastating that there’s a trend of libraries doing away with books.  I can attest to the importance of the “visceral act of discovery in the stacks.” (I love this phrase, Ms. Bond.) Some of the most thought-provoking and artistically inspiring books I’ve ever read were found by accident as I was strolling through the stacks on my way to fetch other books. The joy of just browsing books based on interesting titles and covers is, I fear, a joy that students will not know in 20-30 years. The unfortunate truth is that books are not accessed anywhere near as much as they were before the internet. Many libraries are merely responding to demand. The need for digital media access is much greater. You ask, “how can we continue to make the case for browsable libraries dedicated to fine arts?” or, I assume, any other subject. The answer is simple: use the books that are there. Check them out, or at least lift them off the shelf and use them, and then put them on a reshelving cart. Libraries keep track of what gets used — so don’t think you’re being helpful if you reshelve books yourself. You actually may be contributing to the collection’s demise, by making it appear that the books are unused. Despite all the public lamenting of how “the books are going away,” the truth is, they’re not. Books that get used get to stay, or get replaced when they wear out. Books that no one is using are a waste of space, and they get removed to make way for new books, or for services or spaces that the library’s patrons are demanding. I work in a public library, and we routinely weed books that are outdated, worn out, or simply unused. We don’t have space to keep them; we free up the space for new books that people actually want to read, or sometimes for new space configurations that the public is asking for. The needs of a research library, such as the Fine Arts Library, are different. Such libraries should and do keep books that are in less demand. But no library has infinite space; no library owns, or can keep, every book ever printed on a subject. The best way to make sure a library collection stays is to use that collection. Thank you very much for this informative response. I learned a lot and will try and encourage people to do this in the future. I think that Abigail Sharp has nailed it “physically holding and flipping through print makes all the difference in learning and retention.” Forty-eight years ago I commented to a university art librarian that books would one day be done away with in libraries. I had no idea about PDAs, or digital storage, although there was microfiche. I only wish I had been wrong. While I sometimes look something up on line, and I appreciate the speed of finding what I’m looking for, there is no substitute for finding what I didn’t *know* I was looking for by browsing bookshelves, or “flipping through” the pages of a physical, hand-held book. All too often ‘management’ has little understanding or no understanding of what actually goes on ‘in the trenches’, so to speak. And, of course, it’s a lot easier to ‘relocate’ books than it is to do the hard work of ‘managing’, i.e., actually finding the funds for new facilities. p.s. Just *read* ‘management’s’ statements. They’re full of nothing but empty managementese — a dreadful language that clouds the mind. Indiana University has lost its dedicated Fine Arts Library to an unlikely foe – the Eskenazi Museum of Art (formerly the IU Art Museum).  The museum began a two-year renovation program last spring with the goal of modernizing the facilities and improving dedicated conservation and education spaces.  Unfortunately, the plan also involves the assumption of the Fine Arts Library.  Technically a part of the museum building, the Fine Arts Library and a small lobby area/exhibition space are located where the museum and the Fine Arts building converge on the second floor.  To the best of my knowledge, IU is neither deaccessioning titles nor moving art history texts to offsite storage.  Former FAL volumes will simply be moved a couple of blocks away to the main campus library, Wells Library.  However, I consider the loss of the FAL to be a huge loss to the department.  Besides, the upper floors of Wells Library are generally unpleasant. “A library without scrolls is not a library!” – Alexandria circa 30 B.C.E.

Topic Modeling Headline News About the Anti-Vietnam War Movement in the 1960s: Results and Resources – Adam Tomasi;"Adam Tomasi World History PhD Student @ Northeastern University, Boston Below is a detailed description of the results I arrived at in my Digital Humanities Certificate project at Northeastern, with some helpful resources for anyone who would like to pursue historical topic modeling. My 3,000-word writeup on the entire project, with more references and methodological discussion, can be found here. My latest digital humanities project is a topic model of headline news coverage about the anti-Vietnam War movement between 1964 and 1966. In February 1965, President Lyndon Johnson escalated United States military presence in Vietnam and called up 50,000 draftees. This escalation quickly galvanized the peace movement because the Vietnam War would since have a more direct impact on young people’s lives. Although students traditionally received “2-S” deferments from the draft, President Johnson would revise this policy in 1965 to deny deferments to students below a certain class rank and score on an aptitude test administered by the Selective Service. Even students who maintained their deferments had friends and family affected by Johnson’s military escalation. Both young and old had deep political or philosophical commitments that guided their activism even if their personal lives were not directly upended by the war. Headline news shaped how a reading public understood the anti-Vietnam War movement at this time. Unlike editorials or advertisements that have a more obvious bent, headline news is ostensibly an imminent, neutral recounting of past events. But headline news is not neutral; journalists have to make choices about the selection, arrangement, and prioritization of data, which shapes the topics represented in my corpus. Similarly, my own decisions about the data that went into my corpus were not objective. One rewarding aspect of pursuing digital humanities has been learning to detect biases in other people’s data (a reflective process) while understanding my own biases when creating data (a reflexive process).  Topic modeling, a method used in the digital humanities, can improve our close readings by computationally generating patterns in words from large amounts of text. I used MALLET (Machine Learning for Language Toolkit), a program created out of UMass Amherst, to generate word associations in a collection (corpus) of 118 text files from PDFs of newspaper articles about my subject. MALLET runs from the command line (the ultimate “back-end”) on your computer, and it produces results pretty quickly. But one of the links below includes a Topic Modeling Tool that runs MALLET through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool that only requires changing some settings and ing a few icons. I originally ran MALLET through the command line to get more familiar with the back-end, but eventually used the Topic Modeling Tool because it generated clean CSV data that helped me create some cool visualizations, discussed below. References and Resources Process and Results The topics These are the twenty topics that MALLET generated from my corpus. MALLET does not generate topic labels; the researcher has to decide what those are. I’ve indicated in bold, on the left side, what I assessed these topics to be. The numbers in parentheses are the topic number, referring not to “most important” or “least important” like a ranking, but simply a random order. The decimal values represent the frequency of each topic’s occurrence in the entire corpus (and those values are usually between 0 and 1; MALLET may be giving values above 1 to indicate common discourses, but I have to explore this further).

For example, for “Protest at Ceremonies” (topic 7) I knew from my corpus that students at Amherst College and New York University walked out in protest when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara received honorary degrees at each institution’s commencement in 1966. For “March Leaders” (topic 14), I knew that articles in my corpus referred to the following leaders, whose names are closely associated in the topic: Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Benjamin Spock (famous author of a childrearing manual, turned anti-war activist), Norman Thomas (former Socialist Party candidate for president), and Sanford Gottlieb (march coordinator for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, or SANE). Deciding each topic label was an iterative process of looking back at the texts themselves but remaining faithful to the clusters that MALLET generated. In an earlier iteration of this project, I intended to select the few topics that were most coherent and interesting. I since decided to present all of the topics, messy or not, after discussions with NULab colleagues and my NULab Research Fellowship advisor, Laura Nelson. Doing this acknowledges that topic modeling is more random, and less crystal-clear, than one may previously anticipate. Change over time When designing my visualizations, I was inspired by Robert Nelson’s Mining the Dispatch, a topic model of the entire run of Richmond, Virginia’s Daily Dispatch newspaper during the Civil War. Nelson not only identified topics, such as fugitive slave advertising, he also used line graphs to represent the proportion of each topic in his corpus separated by month and year.  To create my own visualizations, I used the CSV data generated by the one- Topic Modeling Tool referenced above. This CSV had the frequencies by which every topic appeared in each of my documents. Once I named my topics, I changed the column headings accordingly. Because I named each text file according to a year-month-day convention, I could produce line graphs that identified the frequencies of each topic over time. For these line graphs, I focused exclusively on headline news between March 1964 (the earliest month/year in my corpus) and December 1965. Out of my 118 text files, 44 were from 1964 and 1965 (CSV). I narrowed the scope of my visualizations to make them more useful to readers. When I attempted to visualize the entire corpus, or even just the year 1966, the line graph was one giant blur. I mostly excluded topics where the graph only showed a single spike in one month, but kept one example of that below. In a future stage of this project, I will keep working with visualization tools to improve my ability to represent a much larger corpus. See individual photos of the graphs here. Some conclusions that become very clear:  For Students and the Draft, the frequencies increase significantly starting in March 1965 after President Johnson’s announcement the previous February that the military would be conscripting 50,000 people for Vietnam. The Protest Coordination topic has frequencies almost always above 0 because the headline news coverage regularly focused on the leaders and personalities involved in planning anti-war protests, especially notables like Columbia sociologist Staughton Lynd, Dr. King, or David Dellinger (one of the Chicago Seven in 1968). With the Marches (Location) topic, there is an uptick in reporting about the many marches taking place in the streets and parks of cities like New York, after the Tonkin Gulf resolution in August 1964 committed the US to officially fighting a war in Vietnam (to say nothing about the US military’s longer involvement during the 1950s). The other graphs may not suggest immediately significant conclusions, but that’s because visualizations alone do not tell the story. The researcher always has to connect the visualization to the texts themselves, but the visuals operate as useful representations of trends in the corpus (especially when a corpus is very large, which makes close reading one-by-one impossible). While I excluded topics where the graphs did not have an interesting trend line (due to the limitations of my corpus), I’ve included one below because it suggests interesting future research questions: This graph, representing vigils, has two spikes in March and May 1965 with no occurrences elsewhere. This may be an issue with the corpus, or with ending my visualizations at December 1965. But anti-war vigils might have truly been less frequent (or less reported on) than marches and rallies between 1964 and 1965. One of the most interesting vigils, held by SDS members half a mile away from President Johnson’s Texas ranch, took place in December 1966. If I expand the visualization to 1966, there may be other vigils leading up to that moment which made the tactic popular for non-religious organizations in addition to clergy against the Vietnam War. Investigations such as these demonstrate topic modeling’s potential as a tool for examining change over time, and for understanding more clearly how mainstream news outlets chronicle social movement histories.Thanks for reading!

#DH­H21 Themes | Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities | University of Helsinki;"Helsinki Di­gital Hu­man­it­ies Hack­a­thon #DH­H21 will have seven thematics areas of interest with one or more groups per topic, each with up to eight participants under the auspices of the group leaders. Group leaders: Maciej Jan­icki, Kati Kallio, Mari Sarv The group will conduct research on the corpora of Finnic oral folk poetry: Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot (Old Poems of the Finnish People), which in addition to Finnish contains material in Karelian, Izhorian and Votic languages, and Eesti Regilaulude Andmebaas (Estonian Runosongs’ Database). The corpora contain written records of original folk poems, including epics, lyrics, occasional songs (e.g. wedding songs) and charms. From the computational perspective, the datasets are challenging because of large variation in terms of orthography and dialect. The songs contain recurring themes, characters, formulas (fixed short expressions) and overlapping text fragments, but due to the surface-level variation identifying those similarities is a research question for unsupervised language processing. The data, tools and supervision will be provided by members of the project: Formulaic Intertextuality, Thematic Networks and Poetic Variation across Regional Cultures of Finnic Oral Folk Poetry (FILTER). The group can choose to concentrate on either one of the datasets (Finnish or Estonian) or a comparison of both. It is recommended that at least half of the group has high proficiency in either Finnish or Estonian (depending on the chosen dataset). Possible research questions include: Expertise or interest in the following areas will be especially useful: Group leaders: Antti Kanner, Pihla Toivanen, Eliisa Vainikka, Riikka Era It is commonly accepted that the emergence of social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, have changed and challenged the media landscape in important ways. However, because of the sparse availability of concurrent media and social media data, many aspects of the interaction between social media and traditional news media have been left unstudied. This has changed of late, as Twitter has improved the accessibility of its data for research purposes. At the same time, the Flows of Power -project has managed to acquire full dumps of the journalistic output of multiple major Finnish media outlets. The group seeks to find different ways to study the interaction between digital newsmedia journalism and Twitter. The topic will be centred on comparing the presences of and debates around two citizen initiative campaigns in social media and political newsmedia: one for same-sex marriage (Tasa-arvoinen avioliittolaki 2017) and one for legal gender recognition (Translaki). Workflows and analyses will be geared to capture dynamics and interactions related to, for example: The main computational challenges of this topic are mapping different phenomenon arising from Twitter data to newsmedia data, and vice versa. This involves, for example The data available for the group includes all articles from Helsingin Sanomat (the biggest Finnish broadside newspaper), YLE (public broadcast company), Iltalehti (national tabloid) and STT (the main Finnish news agency) between 2011 and 2017, as well as the metadata of YLE’s radio and TV broadcasts. We have also access to Twitter's historical API. Group leaders: Jani Marjanen, Lidia Pivovarova, Axel Jean-Caurant, Martin Gasteiner The international newspapers group at DHH21 will develop a multilingual case that investigates which places dominated the news reporting during the Great War between 1914 and 1918. The group will identify news articles that relate to the war and extract names of places in order to discover which war efforts were covered in the large multilingual collection of historical news.  The digitized newspapers are provided by the project “NewsEye: A digital investigator for historical newspapers”. The NewsEye collection includes digitized newspapers from Austria, France, and Finland in five languages, namely German, French, Finnish, Swedish, and English. We assume that at least one person in the group would know each of these languages, though it is not required to know any of them to join the group (except for English). In addition to data collections, NewsEye provides text processing tools, accessible in the user interface or from API, though it is possible to use anything else to analyse the collection. The aim is not to describe the different battles and war efforts as such, but to compare which locations seemed relevant depending on the viewpoint of the different language papers. Helsinki, Vienna, and Paris got their news through different channels. Consequently, the imagination of what and where things happened during the Great War looked different in those places. Through a systematic comparison, we may be able to understand the spatial imaginaries of war. Possible tasks are: Group leaders: Mikko Tolonen, Iiro Tiihonen, Ville Vaara At Helsinki Computational History Group we have created a dataset of text reuses in the Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO). This dataset was created by running BLAST on EEBO-TCP and ECCO and sidestepping the OCR-problems that often hamper text mining of ECCO. We tracked each case of text reuse of strings of 50 characters or more totalling millions of text reuse cases. The task of this hackathon group is to use this text reuse dataset to study eighteenth-century intertextuality through the uses of English translations of Pierre Bayle’s Historical and Critical Dictionary. This is not the first time that digital humanities project focuses on text reuse cases in dictionaries (Allen et al. 2010; Leca-Tsiomis 2013). The aim of this project is to also learn from these earlier experiences. Research interests This group is particularly well suited for students with a computational background. We aim to create workflows that make the task of using and analysing the text reuse data more convenient. Computer scientists joining the group have the chance of developing tools that tackle challenging historical data, and contribute to the real research questions of historical text reusage. The developed tools would have great potential for further use in later analysis of the dataset beyond the hackathon project. The dataset is very intriguing also from the perspective of eighteenth-century studies. We will focus on the concept of remediation by studying the little known phenomena of text reuse at large scale. We will also study translations as intellectual activity and switch the interest of knowledge from authors to publishing networks where the role of the author is seen in a different light.

The group’s objective is to learn how to use public speech data, in this case parliamentary linked open data, for studying pressing societal issues of the past. Moreover, the group develops and uses tools that allow to identify themes, topics, and place names in the debates, and to classify the debates by using related metadata such as speaker information. The Finnish data exemplifies the parliamentary corpora and the linked open data standards that are developed and used internationally. Parliaments are the main legislative institutions and key places of decision-making and political discussion in our democratic societies. The parliament is a national arena of speaking and debating, to which the Members of the Parliament (MPs), the “people’s representatives”, are elected in regional districts.The parties and the MPs align with political ideologies, but also with geographic areas such as urban centres, the countryside, or their home region. Moreover, locations are markers in the debates about policy issues, such as the environment or foreign policy, where a reference to the Soviet Union or Chernobyl can play different rhetorical roles. The group, thus, will study the different ways in which parliamentary politics and place are related. The group can approach the question from several perspectives in their project, including: The parliamentary debate material and the related metadata are provided by the project Semantic Parliament – ParliamentSampo: Linked Open Data Service for Studying Political Culture (SEMPARL) (https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/projects/semparl/en/). As the parliamentary material is mainly in Finnish, basic knowledge of Finnish is recommended though not mandatory; the computational tasks, in particular, can be carried out in English. Besides the data, the SEMPARL project will provide the group with basic tools or a user interface which allow to browse and search the data. Possible tasks for the project are: Group leaders: Daniela Ceccon, Stefano Ceccon  Terms and conditions of employment are regulated on the society level and have further impact on each individual contract. When independent unions and employers (or employers’ organizations) negotiate those terms and conditions of employment and regulate relations between the parties, the activity is referred to as ‘collective bargaining’. The written document resulting from this negotiation is a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). While being very important for the workers and for the employers, these documents (CBAs) are not easy to find and their content is often unknown even to those who are covered by them. Since 2012, the WageIndicator Foundation (http://wageindicator.org) has been collecting and coding CBAs on a global scale in the WageIndicator Collective Agreements Database (http://wageindicator.org/cbadatabase). The Database currently contains 1600 collective agreements from more than 50 countries and written in 28 languages. The texts have been manually annotated according to 250 labour rights related questions on nine main topics – Social security and pensions, Training, Employment contracts, Sickness and disability, Health and medical assistance, Work/family balance arrangements, Gender equality issues, Wages, Working hours – and the relevant clauses (i.e., parts of text) for each question have been manually selected. Part of the annotation has been carried out under the SSHOC project (https://sshopencloud.eu/) and supported by the CLARIN Research Infrastructure (https://www.clarin.eu/). The resulting datasets contain the collective agreements’ full texts and all the clauses assigned to each question. Research interests The uniqueness and richness of such a dataset gives the opportunity to do research on many levels, as it sheds light on how different topics related to working conditions are addressed in different countries and expressed in different languages. The task of the hackathon group is to gain qualitative insights from the data and see how this output can be potentially shared/made visible for broader groups of Social Sciences and Humanities scientists via services provided by Research Infrastructures. In this group, students with (digital) humanities background and students with an interest in computational language processing, e.g. multilingual texts analysis, will find something exciting to work on. Research ideas for this group might include: Such work will contribute to the research on collective agreements provisions and ultimately help workers, trade unions and employers all over the world to know more about their labour rights at sectoral or company level. Possible tasks to exemplify the work in the group Group leaders: Ajda Pretnar, Matej Klemen, Ruben Ros The group will focus on the comparison of parliamentary debates before and during Covid across Europe from a linguistic, sociological, politological and/or computational perspective. The group’s objective will be to learn how to use comparable parliamentary corpora from various European countries that are annotated with metadata such as speaker and session information and linguistic annotations such as morphosyntactic and named entity tags for studying societal issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The group will also learn how to use Orange (https://orangedatamining.com), a visual programming tool for data mining and machine learning, which means coding skills are not required for exploring the data set. Computer scientists will be able to use their skills to create advanced custom widgets for data processing and analysis. National parliamentary data is a verified communication channel between the elected political representatives and society members in any democracy. One of the most important characteristics of parliamentary data is its direct correspondence with concurrent events, including the ones with a global impact on human health, social life, and economics such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the data synchronically and diachronically in a cross-lingual context, we can obtain important insights into transnational characteristics as well as track the pan-European discussion in times of crisis. The parliamentary corpora will be provided by the CLARIN ERIC ParlaMint project (currently available in Bulgarian, Croatian, Polish, and Slovenian) and is supported by the SSHOC project (https://sshopencloud.eu/). Its goal is to compile a collection of comparable corpora of debates from national parliaments from all over Europe in a harmonized format, covering both the data from the period of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as older, reference data. The first version of the corpora have already been processed linguistically and enriched with metadata, made searchable through popular concordancers for online querying as well as downloadable from the CLARIN repository for independent handling. By the time of the hackathon, a new version with many new languages will be available (English, Dutch, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Czech, Italian, Turkish, Danish, Hungarian, French, Latvian, Romanian, and Belgian Dutch/French). Possible topics and tasks for the group are: P.O. Box 4

Word Embeddings and Their Role in Synonym Ring Construction – The Digital Humanities Commons;"During the past couple of months, I have been trying to come up with an efficient way of constructing synonym rings for query expansion in a library discovery system (i.e., the online search interface of a library). I am doing this because I was given a list of e-books on the subject of Digital Humanities (DH) with the purpose of making them more discoverable on KU Leuven Libraries’ discovery platform. In my previous blogpost, I described what synonym rings are, but simply put, you can think of them as groups of similar words and phrases that should be treated as equivalent for the purpose of information retrieval. An example can be found in Figure 1, where each line forms a different synonym ring. If a user enters a search term that can be found in one of the rings, the rest of the words in the ring will also be added to the query and, thus, the query will be expanded. In this blogpost, my goal is to briefly explain the method that I chose to tackle the task of synonym ring construction. The discovery system used by the KU Leuven Libraries already expands certain query terms with their variant forms using thesauri (such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings) and Wikipedia. So, I wanted to try something different. Inspired by the courses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence, and Corpus Linguistics that I took during the previous semester of the KU Leuven Master’s in Digital Humanities, I wanted to test the suitability of an NLP technique for synonym ring construction. After doing some reading on query expansion, I decided that I should give word embeddings a try.  A word embedding is a list of numbers (a vector) that represents a word. For example, instead of representing the word “Belgium” with letters, we could use a series of numbers that would look like the one in Figure 2. In fact, the vector in Figure 2 is the actual vector that represents the word “Belgium” in a model that I have trained. While there are many ways of obtaining word embeddings, for this project I only considered the word2vec method, presented by Mikolov et al. in 2013.1 2 The word2vec method is known for its ability to pick up semantic similarity.3 4 The numbers that end up in the resulting embeddings are not random: similar words will have similar vectors, which is a feature that comes in handy when creating synonym rings. Turning words into vectors is useful, as, with the help of a similarity measure, it allows us to easily compute how similar to each other two words are. This is where things get interesting when it comes to synonym rings. Training a word2vec model on a relatively small corpus of texts on DH gave me word embeddings that reflect how words are used in that specific domain. I was then able to use the cosine similarity measure to see which words (and phrases) are most similar to my target word (or phrase) according to my model. For example, when trying to see which 10 words or phrases are most similar to the phrase “digital humanities” based on the word embeddings that I obtained, the following list was returned:  Granted, not all of these words and phrases could be included in a synonym ring for the concept of “digital humanities.” However, it was still exciting to see that the top two results were the abbreviation of the exact same term, “DH,” and its predecessor, “humanities computing.” While not exactly synonyms, other results, such as “digital humanists,” could still be considered as good candidates for the “digital humanities” synonym ring. Of course, not all results for all the concepts for which I wanted to create synonym rings were as successful as those for “digital humanities.” Even so, I still consider this method to be promising. First of all, my corpus was (relatively) small compared to what is usually considered a large enough corpus for this type of model training. Given more data to train the model, the results would have been even more accurate. The current results definitely require a human editor to weed them out before adding them to a synonym ring; yet again, even if I had more training data and better results, I think it would still be a good idea to have a human in the loop to make sure that no false positives or biased terms infiltrate the rings. I hope that this brief update about my project was interesting to read and that it inspired you to consider similar experimentations with the collections in your library. If you decided to try it, why not let me know? I’m @mdermentzi on Twitter. If you want to find out more about word embeddings, I highly recommend reading Chapter 6 of the (freely available) book “Speech and language processing” by Jurafsky and Martin or watch Manning’s lecture on “Word Vector Representations: word2vec” on YouTube. For an interesting read on meaning and how much of it machines are able to “understand,” check out the paper “Climbing towards NLU: On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data” by Bender and Koller.

Introduction to Digital Humanities | edX;Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities. As primary sources of information are more frequently digitized and available online than ever before, how can we use those sources to ask new questions? How did Chinese families organize themselves and their landscapes in China’s past? How did African slaves from different cultures form communities in the Americas? What influences informed the creation and evolution of Broadway musicals? How can I understand or interpret 1,000 books all at once? How can I create a visualization that my students can interact with? The answers to these questions can be explored using a wide variety of digital tools, methods, and sources.  As museums, libraries, archives and other institutions have digitized collections and artifacts, new tools and standards have been developed that turn those materials into machine-readable data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for example, have enabled humanities researchers to processvastamounts of textual data. However, these advances are not limited just to text. Sound, images, and video have all been subject to these new forms of research.  This course will show you how to manage the many aspects of digital humanities research and scholarship. Whether you are a student or scholar, librarian or archivist, museum curator or public historian — or just plain curious — this course will help you bring your area of study or interest to new life using digital tools.

Introduction to TEI for scholarly texts | School of Advanced Study;"Textual scholars and other philologists who want to learn about digital methods in their field for editing and publishing texts, may find this introductory workshop useful.

This short workshop will introduce the use of TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML for marking up literary and historical texts and critical editions. Delivered via a mix of asynchronous video tutorials and brief live sessions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we will offer basic instruction in encoding text editions in TEI using a standard XML editor. Participants will be able to choose between a couple of models of TEI usage (including EpiDoc for ancient texts, and modern multi-genre manuscripts), and have the opportunity practice the skills learned on their own texts (or some sample texts provided) and ask for help and feedback throughout the workshop as required. No prior experience in XML or coding is expected.

By the end of the workshop, students will have a working familiarity with TEI structures and vocabularies, and be able to articulate what models might be appropriate for specific editions. Live sessions will be held from 2.00 - 3.00pm BST on Monday 17 May, Wednesday 19 May and Friday 21 May. Fees Tutors © School of Advanced Study 2020

22 April 2021 As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities in a broad sense. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archive collections to support digital pedagogy. Related activities of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA), its Digital Humanities SIG and the ARLIS/NA in the Humanities Commons are also discussed.  As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities (DH) in a broad sense. New art information professionals are expected to conversant with digital humanities.Footnote 1 A proliferation of digital projects created by art and architecture librarians reflects this, as do the position titles of art information professionals, the number of art libraries participating in inter-institutional digital GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) initiatives and the publications produced by the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA). The Society's digital humanities initiatives are not exclusive to its special interest group dedicated to digital humanities, the DH SIG, now nearly a decade old.Footnote 2 Members of many groups, sections, and divisions across ARLIS/NA spearhead and contribute to DH projects, with the collaborative underpinning of digital humanities supporting inter-institutional engagement and innovation. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archives collections to support digital pedagogy.  The Humanities Commons is a platform for open information sharing in the Humanities. Based on the open-source Commons in a Box software, the Humanities Commons began as a project of the Modern Language Association (MLA) and is now maintained by Michigan State University.Footnote 3 In 2018, the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons Planning Task Force recommended that the society adopt Humanities Commons as a “network for facilitating communication and collaboration between members of scholarly communities.”Footnote 4 Subsequently, an Implementation Task Force was formed to develop a branded portal for ARLIS/NA on the Humanities Commons. ARLIS/NA is expected to join the MLA, the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES), the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) and the College Art Association (CAA), on the platform as a participating organization later this year. A dedicated area for ARLIS/NA members and ARLIS/NA publications will encourage engagement both within and across organizations and disciplines in the Humanities. Two projects, A Digital Humanities Bibliography and the Digital Art History Directory, demonstrate the promise of the Commons.  A Digital Humanities Bibliography was recently deposited in CORE, the Humanities Commons shared repository. CORE provides a permanent URL with digital object identifier (DOI), subject and keyword tagging and a download count. In three months there were 235 downloads of the DH Bibliography, which includes 1500 citations, organized alphabetically, on topics including but not limited to the arts.Footnote 5 Documents in the CORE repository can be affiliated with multiple groups (such as Digital Art History and Digital Humanists) as well as a particular organization (such as the upcoming ARLIS/NA Commons) to improve discoverability. The traditional bibliography, even for a newer topic like Digital Humanities, remains a useful tool, and enjoys a wider audience and persistent access in the shared repository.  In addition to structured, open access to publications, it is possible to develop custom projects on the Humanities Commons. The ARLIS/NA Commons will soon feature the Digital Art History Directory (DAHD), a project led by Michelle Wilson, Samantha Deutch and Roger Lawson and supported by the ARLIS/NA Catag Section, Digital Humanities SIG, Web Archiving SIG and Systems Librarian Working Group. The DAHD is a dynamic resource “for discovering, sharing and researching digital art history (DAH) projects. The DAHD is intended to be the largest, most comprehensive and inclusive collection of information on digital art history and to function as a tool and living resource, rather than a static publication.”Footnote 6 Projects submitted for inclusion, which may range from best practices to data sources to digital projects and bibliographies, will undergo a review process prior to publication. A well-designed, user-friendly interface, along with a locally created taxonomy for project types, and subject and keyword searching make the directory an indispensable resource for discovering digital art history. In the deluge of digital information, this project again underscores the place of traditional library work, such as compiling bibliographies, directories and indices, in the digital age. Here changes in technology do not usurp the bibliographer's role; rather they permit bibliographers to facilitate access to non-traditional resources, often not published commercially and not indexed in subscription databases.  The flexible platform of the Humanities Commons, which is built on WordPress, hosts initiatives of different scales, ranging from a single document to the interactive directory discussed above, as well as a group organizing space. The DH SIG will begin its transition to the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons soon after launch by migrating its WordPress website. With shared interests and an informal organizational structure, the DH SIG provides a welcoming place for members exploring digital humanities for the first time, for discovering useful tools and projects and to incubate ideas and collaborations. The DH SIG plans to adopt communication channels available in the Commons including a calendar, social networking features and collaborative document and file sharing. The centralized tools will improve connection between members, streamline the wide variety of communication outlets employed intermittently over the last decade and allow members to publicize their projects on the platform where they are hosted.  Another initiative where a wide variety of organizations and librarians in many roles, including art librarians, have come together is Wikidata, the linked data repository behind Wikipedia and other Wikimedia initiatives. The Wikidata Pilot Project of the Program for Cooperative Cataloguing (PCC) explores identity management through Wikidata. Participating libraries meet monthly for training and discussion of Wikidata or linked data topics. Libraries who have joined the PCC Wikidata Pilot with projects focused on art-related linked data include the Frick Art Reference Library, Michigan State University, the National Gallery of Art, the New Mexico State Library, New York University, Northwestern University, Oklahoma State University, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Smithsonian. Linked data will be created on topics including artists, specifically, from Black, Latinx and Native American communities; artists’ files; art historians/historiography; works of art, including portraits, manga, and campus public art and architecture; archival and special collections; art materials; exhibitions; and government publications.Footnote 7  It is not necessary to participate in the PCC Wikidata Pilot Project to work with Wikidata or linked data. Vanderbilt University and the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, have developed their own projects to share metadata from art museum collections with Wikidata.Footnote 8 Another pilot project exploring bulk transformation of structured data from ContentDM into linked data is OCLC's “Transforming Metadata into Linked Data.” The project report confirms the value of linked data for discovery and visualization, but also notes the difficulties of reconciling data without some manual input and the long-term timeline for the shift to linked data.Footnote 9 Awareness of these linked data projects is important even for librarians who do not catalogue or otherwise create datasets. Once in Wikidata, this data may be used for visualizations, textual analysis or provide access to public domain images useful to art researchers. There will be opportunities to learn about linked data at the ARLIS/NA 49th Annual Conference, which will feature a presentation on linked data from the Frick Art Reference Library and the National Gallery as well as a workshop for beginners, Wikidata for Art Librarians, hosted by the DH SIG and conducted by Will Kent of the Wikimedia Foundation.  The rich data available in Wikidata populates network visualizations and informs a variety of other DH projects. Additionally, conversations about representing communities and languages in linked data and the critical approaches necessary to describe them equitably align with interdisciplinary humanities inquiry. DH visualizations provide an avenue for communicating the complex contextuality of these issues to a wider audience.Footnote 10  Wikidata connects data creators with one of the widest audiences available – users of Wikipedia. Names of artists, works of art, exhibitions, and publications, can supplement and support contributions to Wikipedia. For example, the “info boxes” or “knowledge panels” displayed in both Wikipedia and Google searches display data from Wikidata.Footnote 11 Adding exhibition histories and citations to Wikidata can help establish artists from marginalized communities as “notable” for inclusion in Wikipedia.Footnote 12 ARLIS/NA members have been active as Wikipedia editors, not only in the DH SIG, but across the organization. Recent edit-a-thons for the Art + Feminism Wikipedia group have included the National Museum Women in the Arts Library focusing on women artists of color; Respect Her Crank: A Go-Go Herstory Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon from the Smithsonian Libraries; The Walker Art Center editing articles of womxn artists in the Walker's exhibition Don't let this be easy, among many others. Additionally, Yale and MIT Libraries held the BIPOC in the Built virtual Wikipedia edit-a-thon, a week-long event to create Wikipedia pages for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) artists, architects and designers. No experience is needed to participate in a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and extensive guidance on organizing a local event is available from Art + Feminism and Wikimedia.Footnote 13  Digital skill building meets visual literacy in Building Visual Literacy: A Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Teaching from University Art Collections. Created by Washington and Lee University's University Collection of Art and Art History in partnership with the University Library, these object-based lesson plans “cultivate visual literacy abilities to interpret and evaluate the world around us—important tools for student success in any discipline or career field.”Footnote 14 Photogrammetry of Uncle Tom's Cabin Vase, one of the toolkit lessons, offers a user-friendly overview of this technique for creating a three-dimensional model of a ceramic vase, paired with suggestions for teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Similarly, a Drew University librarian Danielle Reay developed a three-dimensional model to teach visual literacy skills. Using historic documents from the university archives, Reay virtually reconstructed a demolished library building for a research skill building exercise for architecture students.Footnote 15  Since over the past months it has not been possible to travel for museum fieldtrips or the site visits integral to the architecture studio, virtual reality may be evolving from interesting technology into technological necessity. A pilot project at the Frances Loeb Library of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design supported virtual site visits for architecture students in two studio courses. Despite the short turnaround time for the project, site documentation, including videos, was collected for reuse in future courses through the library collections portal.Footnote 16 In this way, DH enhanced the traditional library role of collection development and efficient access to resources. The University of Calgary developed a virtual reality (VR) artist in residence program for art and architecture students. It is an innovative combination of a badge program and a residency. Students receive training, access to VR equipment and applications and other support needed to deliver a shareable VR project by the end of the residency.Footnote 17  Additionally, several three-dimensional collections have been digitized in two dimensions for the first time. The ARLIS/NA 2020 conference presentation Reimagining Unique Collections through Digitization highlighted an 1893 World's Fair panorama captured in glass lantern slides at the University of Kansas, textiles and garments from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Textile Resource Center collection, and fiber arts artist files from The Friends of Fiber Art International Artist File Collection of the American Craft Council.Footnote 18 The Frances Loeb Library and the Rhode Island School of Design Fleet Library launched Material Order Search, a shared digital library of design materials. Robust search and browse features are built on a custom taxonomy for materials that includes production company, usage, composition, and sensorial properties, for example, “touch - rough” to describe the tactile sensation of a particular texture.Footnote 19  Traditional digital collections of visual resources centers and archives are being reimagined as digital humanities projects in increasingly creative ways. The Yale Arts Library brought a traditional art history visual resources collection into more than a thousand dimensions with PixPlot.Footnote 20 PixPlot visualizes a complex neural network using common three-dimensional game design techniques. The result is a highly interactive visualization tool that helps users see connections between objects in new ways. Images from the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale Center for British Art and the Medical Historical Library have also been visualized in PixPlot.  IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is the image display and sharing technology behind many recent innovative visual digital humanities projects, including PixPlot.Footnote 21 Several recent IIIF applications from the Getty Research Center stand out: 12 Sunsets, the Research Collections Viewer and the Animal Crossing Art Generator. 12 Sunsets visualizes more than 60,000 of Ed Ruscha's Sunset Strip photographs. Website visitors maneuver Ruscha's pickup truck along Sunset Boulevard or search by year, time of day, street, tag or keyword to explore the photographs. The Research Collections Viewer provides a more traditional archival view of the same collection and several others. The simple interface contains a novel visualization of the collection hierarchy as well as metadata, permissions, the image comparison viewer, and IIIF manifests. The Animal Crossing Art Generator takes artworks out of the museum—The Getty or any museum that provides IIIF images—and into a popular game by Nintendo called Animal Crossing.Footnote 22 Players find a IIIF manifest URL, paste it into a form on the Getty site to generate a QR code, which will download the artwork onto a wall or an easel inside the game.Footnote 23  In addition to the novel applications noted above, IIIF may be used for traditional art historical image comparison within a single collection as well as across institutions. At the Henry E. Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, Mario Einaudi trains schoolteachers to use ContentDM with IIIF and Mirador to provide dynamic presentations in the classroom. For example, a zoomable map of Chinatown may be contextualized with a detail of a neighborhood as well as historical maps, street views, photographs or objects simultaneously.Footnote 24  As the foundation of many digital humanities projects, digitized collections are included in this overview of recent digital humanities initiatives alongside innovative approaches to manipulating digitized images in the humanities. Despite established workflows and technological advances that have made digitization efforts and digital exhibitions routine, many barriers remain, and many collections are not yet digitized. The authors of Reimagining Unique Collections mention challenges such as communication with vendors; rights clearance; and ongoing server and site maintenance. Digital preservation remains perpetually on the horizon. As Meghan Lyon has observed in her assessment of digitized artists’ archives, “challenges include providing access to an intelligibly navigable and publicly engaging platform; maintaining cohesion, context, and credibility; balancing copyright, privacy, and access; and facilitating cross-institutional collaboration.”Footnote 25  Many digitization projects are noteworthy simply as unique digital surrogates, and many have overcome significant impediments, often without a budget. In this sense, small-scale projects brought to fruition merit recognition alongside more innovative, programmatic approaches to digital humanities in the arts. During the last year as courses moved online and museum capacities were reduced, many digital projects were created, and this overview covers only a very small percentage of DH work in libraries. Employees and resources were reallocated from other departments to create metadata or transcriptions for digital collections remotely. Even with pandemic delays, it became apparent that a great deal could be accomplished under extraordinary circumstances with a relatively small shift in focus.  Another urgent shift, unrelated to the pandemic, is happening. The Maryland Institute Black Archives (MIBA) or Blackives project, by student Deyane Moses, provides some of the clearest evidence that despite the vast number of digital collections, digital humanities projects and digital archives created in art libraries and museums, there are many stories that have not been told.Footnote 26 MIBA documents the Black experience at the College from its beginning in 1892, to a 1935 exhibition on lynching, to 1954, when admission was opened up to students of color, through to the present day. In a 2016 conversation with the LA Review of Books, Jessica Marie Johnson reflected, “DH has offered people the means and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far as I'm concerned….If there isn't a place for this type of work within what we are talking about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty conversation.”Footnote 27 It is vital for art information professionals who create data from collections, develop state-of-the-art interoperability across systems and press forward with new digital tools, to take the time to look backward, to discover gaps in collections and to support colleagues and communities in efforts to rebuild their own histories through digital humanities.  The digital humanities have enabled art libraries to extend the reach of many traditional functions such as collection building and development, bibliographic instruction, providing access to unique materials and original cataloguing in support of art and architecture fields. Collections now house multimodal representations of architectural sites and digital assets in many dimensions. Instruction covers digital techniques such as photogrammetry and visual literacy not only for art and architecture, but across disciplines. Name authorities are being linked in a truly global database, Wikidata, and bibliographies such as the Digital Art History Directory help patrons sort through an abundance of digital art historical projects in a few clicks. The ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons will provide an opportunity to carry out the professional work of art libraries in a truly collaborative fashion. Upcoming projects from ARLIS/NA members include visualization services; digital privacy; crowdsourcing data; art faculty data and research impact assessment; digital accessibility; digital project preservation; digital publishing and open educational resources (OER); multimodal storytelling; virtual reality artist residencies; and oral histories, to name a few — as art librarians continue to increase engagement with their collections through the digital humanities. 1.

Call for Fellows: Data Visualizations Using the D’Argenio Collection – Special Collections & The Gallery;Special Collections & The Gallery Seton Hall University – University Libraries (Fall 2021) Application Deadline: July 15, 2021 Fellowship Period: Fall 2021 Background Seton Hall University Libraries support excellence in academic and individual work, enable inquiry, foster intellectual and ethical integrity and respect for diverse points of view through user-focused services and robust collections as the intellectual and cultural heart of the University.  Walsh Gallery, based in the Library, manages the University’s museum collections, and the Library’s Data Services division assists the University community in managing and presenting their data. One of Seton Hall University’s most distinguished collections, the D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities, includes coins of ancient Greece, the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and Byzantium as well as a small collection of related Byzantine and Etruscan artifacts: oil lamps, game pieces, weights and terra cotta figurines. Donor Ron D’Argenio became interested in ancient coins when taking courses in Greek drama and history as an undergraduate at Fordham University in the 1970’s. In 2001, he generously donated his collection to Seton Hall University in memory of his father, Rinaldo J. D’Argenio, who served in World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for his valor. Ron D’Argenio is a practicing attorney working in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The collection is available for study and research by students and scholars. Data Services offers consultations to SHU community members assisting them with every stage of a data project from conceptualization, to choosing tools, to data analysis, to sharing results.  Find more on the tools supported here: https://library.shu.edu/data-services. Request for Proposals The University Libraries seeks fellowship proposals using the Ron D’Argenio Collection as the basis for projects in the following two areas: Specialists who have at minimum completed all coursework for the the terminal degree in their area are invited to propose research projects that fall under one or both of the above areas. Preference will go to the strongest applications that are both feasible for this collection and our technology infrastructure. All projects should incorporate the Ron D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities.  The final product for the Classics/Art History/History scholar would take the form of a short (5-7 page) written report interpreting the collection which would additionally be shared with the University community as an article or lecture.  The Data Visualization scholar would be responsible for producing a data visualization project which would be publicly presented on the University Libraries website and the process of creation described in an article or lecture.  Beyond the duration of the fellowship, the work of both fellows will inform future initiatives with the collection. You can view a small portion of the Ron D’Argenio Collection of Coins and Antiquities on our Google Arts and Culture page or you may make a research appointment to gather additional data and/or view the collection by contacting us at walshgallery@shu.edu or 973-275-2033. Terms/Eligibility for Fellowships Scholars who at minimum have completed all coursework for the terminal degree in their field may apply.  Work can be performed remotely for the most part.  Access to the collections on site is conducted in a socially distanced environment compliant with all recommendations aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.  The University Libraries will provide each fellow with access to its library databases and resources, accounts in and support for the data software available, an email address and access to Microsoft Teams software for collaboration and Sharepoint for storage space.  Fellows will be expected to give a presentation or write an article on their project to share with the University community by the fall of 2022. Fellows will be paid a stipend of $2500 for projects that focus on one of the two areas.  Half will be paid on award, half on project completion.  Applicants may propose a project that incorporates both Classical scholarship and data visualization for a combined $5000 to be disbursed in the same way. Procedures Submit a single pdf including the following components as an email attachment to library@shu.edu : Notifications Submissions must be received by July 15, 2021.  Applicants will be notified by September 1, 2021.  Research should take place in the fall of 2021, and the project results (written work or data visualization) completed by May 31, 2022.  The lecture or article on the project should take place in the spring or fall of 2022.  Please contact Sarah Ponichtera, Assistant Dean of Special Collections and the Gallery at sarah.ponichtera@shu .edu with any questions.;http://ow.ly/oN5B50ExDl3;

 Apr 28 Wed, 28 April 2021 16:30 – 18:00 BST Online event Digital Humanities communities claim to wish to be inclusive and just, notably in relation to gender, race and sexuality. In relation to gender these aspirations have recently been articulated in terms of intersectional feminism, the latter often taken for granted and adopted – as the ‘right’ way to think about gender and technology relations and as the ‘right’ way to do them (DH in theory, DH in practice, or as a research field). This paper sets out to re-consider intersectional feminism, and its widespread adoption as a naturalized starting position from which to develop feminist work within DH. It engages with other traditions that have theorized relations between overlapping forms of discrimination in systemic terms and that have done so in relation to the technology/gender relation – notably various historical materialist feminisms, and explores the implications of critical race theory writing engaging with intersectionality and/as recuperation for DH work and thinking. The third section of the paper suggests that asking what forms of feminism can productively operate within DH also entails asking where feminisms engaging with intersecting forms of discrimination are operational; in what layer of the stack, at what moment in the pipeline, in relation to which materials? It concludes by arguing for full stack feminism.  Caroline Bassett researches, teaches, and writes about digital technologies and cultural change. She is Director of Cambridge Digital Humanites (CDH), an inter-disciplinary research hub. Current research projects include co-leading IFTe, an AHRC and Irish Research Council network exploring gender, technology and Digital Humanities. Recent publications include Furious, a co-authored monograph written with Sarah Kember and Kate O’Riordan (Pluto, 2020), journal articles including work on histories of automation anxiety and AI, and on expertise.

			Part of the
			Digital Humanities Summer Institute : Technologies East 2021
			(known as DHSITE)   Increasingly DH researchers have greater access to funding to support large-scale multi-partner projects with diverse digital assets. A lack of formal training opportunities for data curation in multi-site DH teams means that the data produced in these teams is in danger of being lost! This workshop is a good preparation for researchers who must create a data management plan to comply with funding agency requirements. This workshop will cover all areas of data management including: IP permissions and informed consent, data collection, metadata standards, file sharing, preservation (data deposit), and data sharing through the open data spectrum of access. Participants will work on their own data curation challenges in break-out sessions and with reference to case study examples presented by a panel of DH scholars and digital asset management specialists:
• Constance Crompton (University of Ottawa),
• Karis Shearer (University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus),
• Matthew Lincoln (Carnegie Mellon University),
• Mikhel Proulx (Concordia University and Indigenous Digital Art Archive) Download recording (.mov)
This workshop was originally developed and delivered at the 2019 Spoken Web Symposium: Resonant Practices In Communities of Sound. It draws significantly upon cases and RDM processes developed and in continued development, across the SpokenWeb research network. Questions?

	During the Cold War, many Princetonians feared a nuclear bomb being dropped by the Soviets on NYC or Philadelphia. Princeton contemplated whether they should construct nuclear fallout shelters to protect their students and Princeton community members in the event of nuclear fallout. 
 
	To address these questions, In September 1961 Princeton president Robert Goheen created the Committee on Fallout, composed of Princeton faculty, to investigate the benefits, disadvantages, and moral implications of constructing fallout shelters. This committee produced a preliminary report in January of 1962. The report identified buildings across campus that had the potential to serve as nuclear fallout shelters, developed plans for renovating these buildings to be appropriate shelters, estimated cost and time this project would take, and estimated the number of individuals these shelters could hold.
 
	Princeton professors were divided on the question of whether or not the University should construct fallout shelters. In the February 11, 1962 issue of the Princeton Town Topics, about 120 Princeton faculty and 68 Rutgers faculty published a letter endorsing President Kennedy's fallout program. Signatories included Princeton President Goheen and Physics Professors John Wheeler and Eugene Wigner. Proponents saw a need to adequately prepare for the event of a nuclear bomb being detonated over NYC or Philadelphia. A second letter signed by 100 faculty members who opposed the fallout program appeared in The Washington Post in late December 1961. Opponents saw fallout shelters as a waste of time, money, and resources. They argued, in addition, that fallout shelters are problematic because they increase the probability of nuclear war: they endorse methods of surviving the aftermath rather than preventing their detonation in the first place. 
 
	Questions also arose as to whether fallout shelters constructed by Princeton should be for Princeton students and faculty only, or if they should be available for Princeton community members, as well. In February 1962, the Committee on Fallout recommended that “any shelter space to be available to anyone at all on a first come-first served basis.” This led to the expansion of shelters to more locations within the surrounding Princeton community. Thirty more locations around the town of Princeton were refurbished and stocked to serve as nuclear fallout shelters for the community.
 
	The fallout shelters were stocked with food, water and sanitation, medical and radiological kits. They were clearly marked as nuclear fallout shelters on the outside of the buildings. In 1962, Congress allocated $169 million for development of nuclear shelters. This money helped fund Princeton’s fallout shelters. On each dormitory door, in the same way that fire emergency exit plans are pasted on doors, there were procedures for nuclear attacks which read “https:/nuclearprinceton.princeton.edu/missing-fallout-shelters.”
 
	Just ten years after the construction of these nuclear fallout shelters, they had been essentially forgotten. In 1973, undergraduate Ronald Mann ‘76 noticed the nuclear fallout procedure signs on his dormitory door and contacted the Division of Fire Safety (DFS) to locate the nearest shelter. DFS was unaware of both the shelter’s location and the signs posted on the doors. 
 
Locations on Princeton’s campus that were ultimately renovated and equipped to serve as nuclear fallout shelters in 1963 included Madison Hall, Holder Hall, Hamilton Hall, Laughlin Hall, Dillon Gymnasium, McCarter Theatre, Firestone Library, McCosh Hall, Frick Chemistry Laboratory, Green Hall, Dickinson Hall, Wilcox Hall, 1915 Dormitory, 1938 Dormitory, Guyot Hall, Palmer Laboratory, Dodge-Osborn Hall, the Engineering Quadrangle, the Graduate College, and the Forrestal Research Center. Princeton Theological Seminary buildings included Speer Library, Campus Center, Tennent Hall, North Hall and Symington House.
 
	Buildings in the Princeton community included Princeton High School, Nassau Street Elementary School, St. Pauls School, Miss Mason's School, Hun School, Columbus Boychoir School, First Presbyterian Church, Second Presbyterian Church, Aquinas Foundation, Our Lady of Princeton, Post Office, Township Hall, Textile Research Institute. Princeton University Press, Van Nostrand Company, 20 Nassau Street, Peacock Inn, the YMYWCA, and University Cottage Club. 
 
	These buildings have since been renovated and converted. Fallout materials have been removed, and they no longer serve as fallout shelters.";https://nuclearprinceton.princeton.edu/princetons-nuclear-fallout-shelters;

 May 12 Wed, 12 May 2021 14:30 – 16:30 BST Online event The PRG Studio of the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media at Birmingham City University invites you to join a series of three workshops that explore the potential of bringing, performing, and communicating research online. The past year has brought about changes we could hardly have predicted. With archives closed and research participants accessible only via video calls, much of the research in the humanities has been moved online at an unprecedented rate. While this has been a challenge for many projects and researchers have had to re-evaluate and reinvent their work, the rapid change has brought about a new interest in working online. Language is there everywhere, yet it strangely escapes us. That is bad news indeed, but the good news is that we can all become more careful users of language and perceptive speaker-listeners quite easily if we are told what to be on the lookout for. And this is exactly what this workshop is going to be about. The workshop will not give you the 5 tips for becoming ‘successful’ participants in a Zoom session, but it will provide a handy ‘tool box’ for self-analysis (when you speak) and active listenership (when others talk).   It will consider the following:  We will consider together how all these parameters might be handled to produce a ‘good impression’ (since this is what we are looking for, after all). During this Zoom session, participants will be given the opportunity to do simple exercises for vocal and postural training, based on poetry reading. It is hoped this will bring something new and exciting to you, something different from the (very useful) ‘role playing’ exercises you may have already done in other ‘professional communication’ workshops. Jean-Rémi Lapaire is a Professor in Cognitive Linguistics, Embodiment and Gesture Studies at the Université Bordeaux Montaigne. He has published widely in the fields of grammar, gesture, and cognition.  You can now view a recording of the first of our workshops at https://youtu.be/tLuNs6lBYEI You can now view a recording of the first of our workshops at https://youtu.be/T_PsmuPyWiw The series is organised by Amélie Doche, Vincent Obia, and Pierre d’Alancaisez in conjunction with Birmingham City University’s PGR Studio.

Day of DH 2021 | centerNet;"Back to Day of DH Main Page On this Page: Day of DH on Twitter | Planning for Day of DH at your Center | On April 29 and Events | Images and Zoom Backgrounds Day of DH 2021 will take place on April 29. The organizing committee this year is led by Loyola University Chicago and UCLA in USA, University of Guelph in Canada, and Università del Piedmont Orientale in Italy. Our theme this year is multilingual DH, and Digital Humanists from all corners of the world are encouraged to share their work not just on Twitter (as always!) but also Instagram, with the hashtag #dayofdh2021. We aim to open up conversation about projects being undertaken in the various languages and put together a list of non-English tools, libraries, software products, tips, hacks, and resources available for researchers and institutions. In the past, Centers have organized events or introduced new activities in their spaces as part of their Day of DH. This Day of DH comes after a year of living in the virtual space and for that, it is more special. We have had a year of seeing human life and technology intersect intimately, and seen its affordances and its limitations come to fore virtual meeting after virtual meeting. So #dayofdh2021 provides us with an opportunity to share and reflect upon how a global pandemic changed DH, its directions, your research questions, and more.
 Over the next few weeks, we will update the website with resources, suggested events to hold on your campus, and more. Keep an eye out, and for queries, please DM us on Twitter, or email us at luctsdh@luc.edu.  Day of DH will be using the Twitter hashtag #dayofdh2021. Day of DH will take place primarily on Twitter, a widely used and easily accessible platform for many. If you  or your center will be writing a blog post or sharing on some other medium, please tweet the URL of your blog post or web page. We will be collecting and archiving posts, and will try to harvest links as well. Please post about your work day, your plans and your daily activities. Day of DH is a way to show how digital humanities happens in many different ways, and is practiced by a varied group of people.    This year, we’ll collect the visual stories and images of the day with the shared hashtag #dayofdh2021. Show off your projects, visualizations, exhibits, or your work-from-home setup. You can also record a reel to share or set up a guide to DH related studies.
  Please share pictures as you share your day! We'd like to make sure that everyone can read and participate in the Day of DH Twitter activity. To that end, you are encouraged to add alt-text to images that you post. To do this, you have to turn on the ""Compose Image Description"" feature which is in the ""Accessibility"" tab in the ""Settings""  of your Twitter app. You will then see a ""Describe Image"" label that allows you to insert a short description of the contents of your image. This is then visible to screen readers and other accessibility software. For more detail, see the Twitter support instructions:  How to make images accessible for people or a video.  The @dayofdh Twitter and @dayofdh Instagram account will be providing news and updates. Following Day of DH on Twitter as it unfolds:   Universities, research centers, and places of work may still be closed for in-person gatherings. However, borrowing from last year, an institution, center, department, or group might host a virtual lecture, project presentation or stream a keynote lecture from the DH conference. Advertising this with the #dayofdh or #dayofdh2021 hashtag might bring many more attendees to your event than in our former, embodied times. You could also host a session of the Floating Meet-up.
 Follow the @dayofdh Twitter account for latest news.  Here are some event ideas you can put together for at your DH organisation:  Events will be listed here in the days/weeks to come, along with time zones. Join us in hearing lightening talks from our graduating MA students in Digital Humanities about their research capstone projects. Speakers will be: Friday, April 30, 2021, 12:00-2:00pm CST via University of Chicago Digital Forum. Note the date: this event falls on the day after Day of DH 2021.
To register, please visit the DH Forum website.  In her 2016 essay, “Making the Case for Black Digital Humanities,” Dr. Kim Gallon articulated a framework for how technology, employed in an “underexamined context” could further our understanding of a “racialized social construction” that shapes global society. Gallon’s call for black digital humanities has been manifested in DH projects that seek to recover, refine, and recontextualize race and culture questions. In this address, I will explore the manifestations of this Black DH ecosystem and articulate links between my own exploration of black speculative practice through real and imagined space as a manifestation of this Black DH framework. Julian C. Chambliss is Professor of English with an appointment in History and the Val Berryman Curator of History at the MSU Museum at Michigan State University. In addition, he is a co-director for the Department of English Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition Lab (DHLC) and a core participant in the MSU College of Arts & Letters’ Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR). His research interests focus on race, culture, and power in real and imagined spaces. An interdisciplinary scholar he has designed museum exhibitions, curated art shows, and created public history projects that trace community, ideology, and power in the United States. The Corr-Proust team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is working on transcribing and translating the collected letters of Marcel Proust, and the team behind it is working from three continents in two languages (so far, with the possibility for more as the translation wiki expands). They have put together a multilingual content management system and workflow organizer for less than $500, and the translation wiki is entirely free. They're happy to tell anyone who’s interested how they did it.
The team is holding open hours from 3:30 – 4:30 Central time on Thursday, April 29, and https://go.illinois.edu/CorrProustPresentations will have the Zoom information. Do join them! The Twitter stream will be harvested and the archive will be cleaned up and placed in one or more trusted repositories, such as Zenodo, as permitted.

 centerNet’s new publication, DHCommons, is merging with Arts-Humanities.net to create one large-scale discovery and review publication for digital humanities projects.   The Resources page lists talks, articles, sample DH proposals and other sources of information about ways to start and sustain DH centers. 
 A Day of the Life of the Digital Humanities, an event where digital humanists from around the world document what they do. If you think your center is a digital humanities center, in whole or in part, then we’d be glad to have you join centerNet. We leave the definition of “digital humanities” up to you, but we intend to be inclusive, and we know that there will be cross-over into the social sciences, media studies, digital arts, and other related areas. This might include humanities centers with a strong interest in or focus on digital platforms.  One caveat—a “center” should be larger than a single project, and it should have some history or promise of persistence.

Schedule;"This talk will examine the emerging areas of research in Digital Humanities in India by an examination of the term “Digital Humanities” and its uneven and uncertain trajectory in the Indian research ecosystem. As with other systems around the world, DH in India is complex and contextual and each of us involved in the disciplinary practice encounter resistance and skepticism.  Resistance to what is perceived as a deliberate distancing from the larger Humanities queries, scepticism about appropriating the rhetoric of STEM disciplines merely as a tool for greater legitimacy and validation. But of course DH is far more than a sum of its criticisms and scepticisms. I will address why it is imperative that the digital be harnessed, critiqued, deconstructed and dissected precisely so that the issues that Humanities scholars have been invested in continue to be at the centre of the development, deployment and dissemination of technology.   The Swedish Caribbean Colonialism 1784–1878 project (SweCarCol) integrates, orders and opens up important dispersed archives for research by publishing them on the Internet in cooperation with Uppsala University Library.      The paper describes and discusses a series of DH projects that have developed at CESTA and have addressed major issues in the history of the Atlantic World, including slavery and the experience of enslaved and freed persons in particular.   International, interdisciplinary spaces are inevitably sites of tension, where differences in linguistic and cultural norms run deeper than they initially appear. Establishing and maintaining a set of norms for a community to operate despite these differences requires ongoing dialogue within that community. This talk will reflect on language as one longstanding axis of diversity within digital humanities as it is carried out at the international level, as well as within different national contexts. This context will inform a frank discussion of the ways in which a general obliviousness towards languages commonly found in Anglophone countries has negatively impacted Anglophone scholars' research, pedagogy, and engagement with the broader field of DH. The talk will conclude with actionable steps that scholars, particularly in Anglophone countries, can take towards embracing language as an important axis of diversity.   While projects focused on Black culture, texts and artifacts are not as rare as they once were there remains a lack of understanding of the rich and deep histories of Black DH and its impact on the field. Sharon Leon’s foundation chapter, “Complicating a ‘Great Man’ Narrative of Digital History in the United States,” serves as a model of the necessary documentation that scholars must compile of alternative histories of digital humanities. Accordingly, this talk will document a deep dig into the ecology of digital humanities, centering Black DH work in the field. Among the scholars’ work discussed will be Abduhl Alkalimat, creator of e-black studies, Bryan Carter, Virtual Harlem, Marilyn Miller Thomas-Houston, iBlack Studies and co-editor of the multi-media journal Fire!!, Ronald Bailey, who developed www.dignubia.org and www.nubianet.org and Afro Publishing without Walls, and Maryemma Graham, History of Black writing. An ongoing project, I am conducting interviews with such foundational Black dh scholars to better understand their contributions to the field.  This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion we will broaden the question to digital humanities, and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalised in digital humanities discourse.  This talk has two parts. It will first attempt to frame what a history of digital history might look like, by focusing on hybridity as a key characteristic of historical research, seen as some form of integrating newly emerging tools, technologies, materials, and/or practices in historical research, and mapped and qualified according to the main phases of historical research. My main argument here is that, in order to ground our current ‘digital’ practices and learn from past experiences and expertise, we need an answer to the question: what were, and are, the continuities and ruptures in the use and uptake of new technologies in historical research, and in the debates that accompanied them?
		The paper will then proceed to outline what groundwork is necessary to explore digital history’s forgotten roots: a basic overview of the field’s different spatio-temporal trajectories and the networks of computing historians in the pre-PC and early PC period. A key focal point for such a reconstruction are the DH conferences that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, either as singular events or strands of bigger conferences such as the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Moscow in 1970, and later those that were organised under the aegis of the Association for History and Computing (AHC, 1987-2001) and its national member organisations. By studying which scholars attended and where they came from, and by linking that to the topics and methods that were discussed, it will be possible to chart, over time, shifting geographical, topical and methodological developments.
	In the second part of my paper, I will provide the first results of a concrete case study which is part of this broader endeavour, namely a web archaeology of the old AHC website and H-NET Discussion List for History and Computing (now: H-DigitalHistory).  The Digital Humanities have profoundly altered the way that humanities scholars work, research, and teach. While the introduction of computational methods, from GIS, to Digital Archives, to Text Mining, have opened up new fields to practitioners, these fields have also changed the social fabric of the humanities. Although the myth of the lone scholar, toiling away in their office, or in the archives, remains deeply embedded in the psyche of the discipline, the growing influence of the Digital Humanities has begun to offer scholars other opportunities for research work and teaching. Not only are our new methods collaborative by nature, they are often collaborative by necessity, frequently requiring us to work in teams that can leverage different experience and skills towards a set of research goals. In this talk, I want to explore the ramifications of this shift in research practice, focusing on the sociology of the humanities lab, as distinct from both the science laboratory, and the traditional practices of History, Classics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Literary Study. How has the collaborative nature of our work altered the kinds of research that we can produce? How has interdisciplinary cooperation challenged ideas of evidence, method and results in the humanities? How has the collaborative model of research changed our pedagogy? What new kinds of equality, and inequality, between faculty, staff and students, has this change enabled? And what does it mean to work collaborative in fields whose institutional structures persist in disincentivizing collaboration? Drawing on my own experience working at, and directing, the Stanford Literary Lab, an ongoing collaborative research group that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, I want to focus on the outstanding questions that we are only now beginning to address around this radical shift in the humanities.

DELVING INTO DIGITAL HUMANITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC: A VIEW IN RETROSPECT – Emile's World;"Emile's World 
			Discover yourself and learn about me		 Welcome to my second blog!  “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey” – Ralph Waldo Emerson (Goodreads). This quote clearly applies to our ENGL256B course: while we are constantly working on our multiple assignments, what matters is not only the final result, but rather the incredible experience we are getting while practicing the diverse Digital Humanities tools. This blog will shed light on our encounters as a group with the various DH tools as well as our methods of analysis during the Pandemic. The pandemic was a shock to the whole world which left close to everything on pause. Fortunately, after being in this situation for over a year now, we have learned to overcome the obstacles of distant learning. We are going to cover the good, the bad, the easy, the hard, the fun, and the more challenging aspects of learning how to use and interpret Digital Humanities tools from a distance.  First group meeting with my #ENGL256B colleagues! Got to know the team, and we jump-started the writing process. A great Final Project is on the way! @DoseofdH @TalaS_Eng256B @Jeffyammine914 pic.twitter.com/JUDgdYRLHX China has been using artificial intelligence and digital humanities to control and survey their population. Will the future of digital humanities interfere with our freedom for the sake of security?Check out this video and give me your opinion:@ENGL256Bhttps://t.co/O17Ga1eIR9 https://t.co/7j8i2MPSFd Sherlock Holmes: A Science-Based Detective! Indeed, Holmes used many forensic science tools to solve his various mysteries. In our #ENGL256B course, we are trying to clarify how these tools were used and how science is reflected in the books' linguistics. It’s crazy how everything is transferring to digital formats! As I get exposed to more articles like the one below, I wonder, how much information will people turn digital? #ENGL256B https://t.co/TMtdIP6pMV The most crucial part of a research whether it’s physical or digital is DATA ANALYSIS. Use Voyant tools for this task and check the review I found today! @ENGL256B #ENGL256B https://t.co/PeDUi22zGz The first DH tool we were exposed to was Twitter. It was something new to all of us. However, we can’t deny how much we enjoyed it. You can tweet anything that comes to mind. When we say anything, we literally mean ANYTHING! You can talk for example about launching your first website, about group gatherings you had, in-class or assignment-related activities, or more formal tweets sharing some articles you may have found online. Since the Digital Humanities field is so broad, we could either learn from others’ tweets or inform our followers about cool facts on this topic. Below are some examples of diverse tweets we made during the semester: Elio shared an interesting article on Sherlock Holmes, a man who relies on science to analyze his cases, and uses clues such as footprints, fingerprints, hand-written documents, and many more. Emile posted a video that raises the question about the future role of DH in invading people’s freedom in order to establish security, Tala tweeted an article about the conversion of any literal paper to podcasts and Jeffery stressed the importance of Voyant Tools in data analysis. You can view the tweets below and don’t forget to follow us 😉 On top of that, we learned about other groups’ projects and their views on diverse matters. If this doesn’t make you want to create a Twitter account, We don’t know what will!  here to check an interesting article about Twitter! Speaking about groups, you can’t imagine how challenging it was for us to meet. Each member was living in a different world. Tala lives on the West Coast of the US whereas Emile lives on the East Coast. That’s 3 hours’ difference between them. Jeffrey and myself both live in Lebanon, so you can notice the huge hours’ difference in time zones. Hence, we had to find a time which would suit all of us. Usually, we would meet at midnight EET (Eastern European Time) which would be the equivalent of 5:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) and 2:00pm PST (Pacific Standard Time). On top of that, working in groups through WebEx is sometimes frustrating, especially during the first few meetings. We are sure that most of you, if not all, would rather have physical meetings instead of online meetings. The work is much more productive and efficient when we can interact physically. As discussed in blog 1, online learning was challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic; not to mention the several electricity cuts and other logistical difficulties. However, when there’s a will, there’s a way! We did our best to overcome all these obstacles. We held around 3 meetings per week for every ENG 256B assignment. During our ENGL256B classes and group meetings, we had hands-on experience with many Digital Humanities tools throughout the semester. From Google My Maps to StoryMap JS, Palladio (for both mapping and network analysis), Topotext, Antconc, Voyant Tools and many others. Some were very user-friendly and easy to use while others were more complicated. This comes on two levels: the technical level – navigating the website and knowing where to upload our data, how to export it etc., and the analytical level – creating insightful conclusions from the different visualizations we got.  From a technical standpoint, we found Google My Maps to be quite hard to use. First, it requires exact coordinates, so a location as broad as a city cannot be easily represented. Unfortunately, locations in many of the Sherlock Holmes stories we worked on were broad / not very precise, so we had to filter our results to locations that could be correctly entered and that would yield some insight and conclusions. Moreover, to create a Google My Maps map, we had to create a spreadsheet in which our data would get reflected. The problem here was that a small mistake in the spreadsheet data entered would impact the presentation on the map. For example, if we entered the coordinates in the wrong format, we would get wrong locations on the map, and that would definitely affect our analysis. Another issue was that once a layer is inserted, we would not be able to edit it in case we wanted to add an entry, so we had to delete the layer, go back to the initial spreadsheet, and add/rectify the data. Furthermore, we did not find the aesthetics of Google My Maps to be as appealing as StoryMap JS. However, after watching some tutorials posted on our ENGL256B Moodle Page, and following the directions of our instructor, we were able to manage those difficulties, and create a very nice and insightful map to include in our final DH Project     The map we developed using Google My Maps. February 2021.   However, the most challenging part of any research project, especially a Digital Humanities one, is usually not the technical but rather the analytical part. As we mentioned earlier, any logistical difficulty could be resolved by watching some tutorials and following instructions; however, the analysis process varies between projects while mostly being unique to each topic. In fact, while we found the Voyant Tools website to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, we had a hard time choosing the terms and themes we wanted to focus on, and that is due to many factors. First, since we are working with thirty literary texts, finding a clear trend among such a large number of texts was not an easy task. Second, despite the automatically generated stopword list in the “Cirrus” tool, many of the words in our word cloud were not really significant. For example, while many of the most frequent words were similar in all the stories, there were always variations, especially in stories that have additional characters. For example, in this Cirrus cloud generated from “The Hound of the Baskerville”, we see names such as “Stapleton, Moor, Henry, Baskerville, Barrymore…”. Those refer to people or places that are specific to that novel, and are absent from other stories. As a result, these terms are not really relevant to our analysis of the role of Forensic Science in the Sherlock Holmes canon. So we had to add such words to the stopword list manually to create a meaningful Cirrus cloud.  Cirrus Cloud generated on Voyant Tools (The Hound of the Baskerville). April 2021.   Third, although we found some interesting trends that indicate the relative occurrence of some words throughout the novels, those were not always perfect. While this was expected since novelists rarely follow hard rules when writing, it somewhat impeded our analysis and made us reluctant to focus on the given terms. However, we finally managed to narrow down our analysis to some interesting trends that we plan to include in our final presentation. Finally, while concordances would definitely help us, the recurrence of some words was so high that we could not really give a correct representation of the context of these words in a limited time frame, and this pushed us to rely more on tools other than concordances. Another “obstacle” we faced was finding our digital data. Since many articles are not from trusted sources or not peer-reviewed, we couldn’t rely on them for our analysis. This task was more complex since we were not working on-campus, where librarians would assist and provide some trustful journals or articles to enable us to derive our data. However, thankfully an AUB librarian, Mrs. Nabila Shehabeddine was always there to help: she gave us a presentation on how to cite our sources, and taught us how to check if a certain article was peer-reviewed. She also contributed to the Master Spreadsheet in which all students entered their sources. This task was definitely valuable and one of the reasons we made it this far in the course. We also held many meetings with our course instructor to monitor if we were on the right path and to get constructive feedback about our work. We’ve covered the difficulties we had while using some DH tools, however not all tools were as hard and complicated, and some were much more rewarding than others. One of the most satisfying moments we had while working on our diverse assignments was the creation of our first network. Indeed, we found Palladio to be easy to use, and the resulting visualizations to be very meaningful. Here are some of the networks we generated using Palladio. Two networks we generated using Palladio. March 2021. In fact, we consider Network Analysis to be the most easily interpreted representation of a significant amount of data and interrelations. It can emphasize key components, inter-dependencies, and the relative importance of nodes all at once (Otte). Networks are also very aesthetically pleasing and can clarify ideas for visual learners. We really had a great time manipulating networks, cross-linking different sets of data as sources or targets, manipulating the size nodes, links, highlights to get very effective networks. This will probably be apparent in our Final DH Project, since we are leaning towards Network Analysis more than the other tools despite the fact that none of us had learned about or used it ebfore in another course. And while we first encountered this method of analysis in this Digital Humanities class, we soon found ourselves very comfortable manipulating it. Actually, all of us equally contributed to creating networks, and most importantly compiling the data from which we built those networks. On a side note, while creating our networks, we made a funny analogy: we compared the process of building networks to an iceberg: 90% of an iceberg is submerged so we can’t see it, which leaves only 10% of the iceberg apparent. Palladio Network analysis is a bit similar, since 90% of the work was put into creating the spreadsheet filled with our data, and this is not seen in the final result. Only actual networks will make it to the final presentation, and such represent 10% of the work. Overall, Palladio Network analysis was definitely the tool we all liked the most. One might wonder how ENGL256B – introduction to digital humanities is different compared to other courses! Like most English courses at the American University of Beirut, students from all majors lign up to register for the class. However, this is not the typical English course required by the university for one to take. In fact, it is rather one of the most desired classes at the University. Students are eager to register for it to learn and implement the newest digital technologies in their day-to-day life, and especially for their specific majors. Reflecting on the advancement of the digital world, the class tends to offer a variety of platforms that are very informative and practical to use, all with the purpose of enhancing the representation of information. Now one might think, is this what makes it so special? We will address the subject in more depth and show what makes it unique. Coming from different backgrounds, our team encompasses one Biology student, one Chemistry student, one Civil Engineering student, and one Economics student, thus making it a diverse and versatile group. This combination and diversity of students is only present in very few classes at AUB. With more than 60% of the course relying on constant teamwork, we had to conduct long meetings over Webex as previously mentioned, followed by daily checkups. This intensive yet interactive class requires one to deal with different minds and different approaches throughout the semester. As a team, we worked and kept building on what we learned in previous meetings to reach the different goals that we had specified at the beginning of every week. Since most of our team members come from a technical background, we were constantly busy looking at formulas, concepts, theoretical hypotheses, rules, calculations, variables we rarely apply in our daily life. During the course and after learning a new concept after every class, we would directly put our new knowledge to use by implementing the information we had just learned. When we signed up for ENGL256B with Dr Najla Jarkas, our professor had created the perfect environment for us to learn and create something for ourselves from the beginning. It all started with the building of a website of our own, an all-time objective of mine and of most students nowadays. We also created personal blogs and talked about our experience in the course. Today as we work as a team, we are writing our second blog and sharing with you the enhanced features of this course. In addition to this, stay tuned to our grand finale, our final project, to see the end-results of our teamwork. No matter how diverse and special our group is, we all came to a mutual agreement that what makes this course stand out from all other courses offered by the university, is this informal method of learning. We are constantly being introduced and taught about new tools and platforms. What is a better way to perform, execute, and get feedback on your work? The concept that this course employs “it is never too late to improve your work” pushes you over the limit and allows you to perform and learn from your mistakes, with the objective of creating a better version of yourself! Expectations versus Reality Being fortunate enough to have taken this course, we also didn’t really know what to expect. Yes, you can get feedback from other students about certain courses but some courses you should personally experience. We heard only positive feedback about this course and we were super excited to delve into the learning outcomes of the course. Seeing as this course is an elective course, we weren’t really sure what to expect. However, the very elaborate explanations of our instructor, Dr. Najla Jarkas, never left us confused. We expected a basic introduction to the digital humanities field and possibly even picking up some tools we can use in other courses. Nonetheless, this course has given us way more than that! When we initially listened to the explanation of the syllabus and what we will be covering throughout the semester, we felt a bit overwhelmed. Thankfully, our teacher assured us that everything will be clearly explained and we will always have our class’s Moodle page to refer back to in case we feel lost. This is not to mention the constant help and support from the teacher herself either during class, after class, or during her office hours. The amount of support through consistently updating the documents on Moodle and allowing us to learn from our mistakes and improve our work is unmatched by any teacher we have ever had. Expectation vs Reality, 2020. We are near the end of this course, and we can confidently say that we now possess skills that will not only aid us in our other university courses, but also in the workplace and in our everyday lives. The various tools utilized throughout the course were all very beneficial to us seeing as the majority of our group are visual learners and the path to the completion of our project became clearer as we overcame each assignment on a weekly basis. The journey was not easy, but the result will definitely be worth it. Stay tuned for our third blog in which we will reflect on the whole process of creating our Final DH Project!

Digital Humanities - Complexities of Digital Humanities Tools During Times of Crisis;Mohamad Sweidan                                    April 16th, 2021 When it comes to the concept of digital humanities, we can all express our novelty to this field that combines both technology and literature. Despite us falling into the category lucky enough to call ourselves “digitally literate” due to our previous experiences and knowledge in most of the requirements of this field, yet, the terms of their usage and the ways by which we were required to integrate our knowledge into this course has been completely new. As a group, we have all used Twitter as a social media application before, often going onto that platform to share our thoughts through tweets, or maybe just follow people we are interested in, and have also found ourselves people of interest for others to follow us and interact with us as well. Still, none of us ever thought they’d be using this website to engage in analysis of some literature of our choosing, posting our takes on some ideas, or tweeting our data and findings for other digital humanities students to view and comment on. We never thought we would be inducted into the digital humanities community on Twitter and actually focus our thoughts and posted content on this narrow topic that we had limited information about.  A little backstory about my personal experience with Twitter I have had my personal accounts wrongfully suspended 5 times by Twitter for violating policy. But I was finally able to get back my original account unsuspended, hence the handle @MoeThe6th.  Figure 1. My personal  Twitter profile, showing some of my interests, that I created back in August 2014. Similarly, we have all used Google Maps in our travels, looking for places that we do not know about their exact locations or navigating ourselves in places we are not very familiar with. And for those of us who have not been users of this application, we are at least familiar with the concept of an online map that pinpoints precise locations of practically every corner around the globe. Yet, we also find ourselves baffled at the idea of us creating a map of our own, following into the footsteps of some character from a fictional book we read. However, working on our own version of a map and uploading our data and information in the form of markers, pictures and coordinates into a map of our choosing was a project we enjoyed to the fullest extent in our group. Luckily for me, we had the chance to work on mapping some of the locations in The Da Vinci Code (2003), along with the key locations in life of the author and my favorite writer, Dan Brown.  Figure 2. Map representing some milestones of Dan Brown's life and most important locations in one of his books, The Da Vinci Code (2003). The same can be said about other digital humanities tools, and even more can be expressed about the tools that we were completely unfamiliar with and have only discovered during our journey in this course. When weighing the benefits of digital humanities tools, we must consider how they have massively helped us by presenting and interlinking digitized texts, images, and time-based media within maps, timelines and visualizations helping us to see more, experience more and collaborate together on this project we have chosen (Gubert, 2016). On the other hand, we cannot deny that we have struggled with some aspects of the course as well that we will go over in this blog.  Keep up-to-date with my latest tweets about Digital Humanities by checking the above Twitter feed. When it comes to Twitter, I think the greatest tussle would have to be coming up with original and informative tweets to share with the audience of our followers. It is easy to run a personal account and tweet the first thing that pops up into your mind, and most of the time your tweets don’t even have to make sense to anyone but you. But when there are certain etiquette you have to follow to make up a tweet, and when you are addressing a specific population in an effort to present useful information, there’s only so much you can tweet. For this reason, keeping up with the required number of tweets proved to be a bit more difficult than any of us imagined it would be. Another issue we encountered with Twitter was being able to integrate ourselves into the digital humanities community on the platform. However, over the course of the semester and as we began to participate in discussions among ourselves and with other classmates or students from other sections regarding the analysis of tools and their usage, we came to the realization that we, ourselves, have become the digital humanities community that we so longed to be a part of.  For the sake of organization and for meeting course requirements with ease, I created a different Twitter account, @MoeENGL256B (my 7th on that platform!) and dedicated it to Digital Humanities, tweeting mostly through the hashtag #ENGL256B. Figure 3. Comparison between my Twitter activity on my personal account vs. my new Digital Humanities account. Another simple aspect we found ourselves entangled in during this semester was the ability to attend and participate in online classes on a regular basis. As senior students, our responsibilities have grown larger, and our requirements have gone even further allowing us but little time to achieve the perfect attendance and participation score we all strive for in this course and in any other course. Unfortunately, due to the current situation in Lebanon and the limitations posed on even the most basic of resources such as electricity and the Internet, maintaining that attendance record proved to be challenging. Furthermore, with the current lockdown state we are in due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our inability to attend and practice these digital humanities tools on campus and in our prestigious computer labs under the supervision of our instructor, gaining as much as we can through online education proved to be a hassle during this pandemic that proved to be much more than just a health crisis (Burgess, 2020). Luckily for us, and with the provision of all course materials online, we were always capable of catching up and staying up-to-date with our assignments, deadlines and course content. Considering that digital humanities is mostly online, and the tools we learned about can all be accessed freely on certain websites, this allowed us to experiment with these tools and apply our gained knowledge through them at our own pace and in our own time.  In our journey with the course, we had the courtesy to explore different online digital tools. Many of these tools were new to us, but with the discussions and explanation from Dr. Jarkas, we are now able to use them in our analysis and build of our final digital project. The tools were very helpful in understanding our selected books and using them to build on the project. To be honest, not all the team members read the books of Dan Brown that entailed the journey of Robert Langdon. However, by applying distant reading and using these tools, we were able to understand the books and explain the intended topic which is the portrayal of good versus evil in five of Dan Brown's books. As will be discussed later in the blog, Voyant was the best tool we found relevant in displaying the analysis due to several features provided by this online digital tool. On the contrary, we found that AntConc was a bit complex and required some additional work. We mostly relied on Voyant and not AntConc because the last provides fewer features in terms of analysis and visualization of the uploaded corpus. One of the difficulties we faced when using AntConc was the need to have our searched terms in table forms. We need those forms to have an idea about the frequency of the most used terms in our analysis of the corpus. The other difficulty was having detailed statistics related to our analysis of the corpus and search results since AntConc lacks this feature which Voyant has. However, the main reason we used it was its easy feature of having the option of copying and pasting the results into a spreadsheet that would be useful for our project. Since we had some difficulties working with the program, yet needing it in our analysis, we had to put more effort to understand how it works. Thanks to Dr. Jarkas who uploaded several tutorials on Moodle, our online education portal, regarding the work on AntConc starting from the basic features and getting to know how to use the concordance tool. The uploaded tutorials included a link to a YouTube video provided by Laurence Anthony, a freeware concordance software program for Windows.  Anthony’s YouTube channel helped us a lot to overcome our difficulty with using AntConc. The YouTube channel contained a lot of videos explaining how to use the software. The steps were very clear, and one of the things we learned when watching the video for example is that  a user clicks on any search term in the KWIC (keyword in context) results will automatically display and open in the view files tool and the results could be either displayed in columns or hidden depending on the user preference in the intended analysis. Even though we faced some technical difficulties while working with the software, we must say that the tool was extremely effective in our analysis of the corpus. It was low-key fun working with this tool especially when we had the group meeting and read the guide together. Seeing each other’s trial and error when using it was very funny and at the same time helpful to complete the project. Check out the 1st tutorial about getting started on AntConc by clicking on the adjacent video. Figure 4. AntConc relates the word power frequently to the church in The Da Vinci Code (2003) and virus to a form of unethical Bio Terrorism in Inferno (2013).  When it comes to the question of the most exciting tool we used, the answer has to be Voyant. It is a free web-based text reading and text analysis environment for large, unstructured digital collections that include plain text (.txt), Microsoft Word, and PDF.  It is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students by displaying graphs and  word cloud… Each of these options has its own features to further visualize data. Uploading a corpus can create visualizations such as graphs of word frequencies and you may embed them into pages for future exploration. In addition, you can analyze vast amounts of textual data within and between individual texts, see word trends in single/ multiple texts and find the context of specific works and trace shifts of emphasis over time that were not previously possible. One of the reasons why we like Voyant is because it is easy to learn and user friendly. We uploaded the plain texts of Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013) and Origin (2017) and Voyant generated a default word frequency cirrus and graph. Were they hard to understand? Not at all, because Voyant portrays the ideas in a visually pleasing way that make it easy for the reader. Cirrus is insightful and it is a visual aggregation of the most common words. It indicates the most used words in the documents. That means the larger the word is represented, the more frequently across the corpus. Voyant allowed us to enter words such as “ church”, “virus”, “power”, “sin”, ”science” and even more. Their trends vary as well, for instance, in the book of Angels and Demons (2000), the trend of “science” is above “power”. These words  establish a relationship of how good and evil was portrayed in Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series. The tension between religion and science continuously showed up by searching certain words and phrases in Voyant. In some books, Christianity and the church represented the evil entity hungry for power, while in others the unethical use of bio-terrorism represented the dark side. Personally, I have never used Voyant or any other similar digital humanities tool before in any course or project, but I am very thankful that I did because I uncovered a limitless world of Digital Data!  Throughout the course, we have continuously learned about different methods for generating digital data. None of us had any prior experience with any of the tools we learned so far. Although we eventually adapted to using them efficiently to provide the needed data, we faced some issues along the way. At first, we found difficulty in finding plain texts for our novels in the right format. We struggled with finding credible online sources that we could use. In addition, many of the texts that we found contained missing parts or only included some of the chapters. After we held a meeting with Dr. Jarkas, she recommended some sources online to use and also taught us how to convert the text into (.txt) file. Once we found word documents or PDFs for all our novels, we converted them into text files and removed parts that were not necessary or segments that contained symbols. Cleaning the books in order to become in the correct format for use in the digital tools was relatively easy after we got the hang of it. One instance we particularly faced trouble with was when Voyant's website went down for an entire day while we were working on analyzing Dan Brown's books for one of our assignments which ended up getting resolved late at night when the servers were rebooted. Check our little interaction with Voyant Tools on Twitter during that blackout in the tweet below! Another process we found difficult was using TopoText for our first ever mapping assignment. TopoText was not covered in depth during our lecture, so we had to discover it by ourselves. It provided many locations in The Da Vinci Code (2003), many of which were not relevant to our topic or did not entail the important encounters of the main characters in the novel. However, since some members of the group are highly familiar with Dan Brown novels, we decided to find the relevant locations online and through skimming through the books again and manually inputting them on the spreadsheets. After researching for many hours, we were luckily able to construct the map on Google My Maps. We then set up a common Google Drive folder shared between all members of our group containing all the files related to the Digital Humanities project we have chosen, and continued to improve it for the sake of organization and completion of our work.  Regarding the other tools such as AntConc, Voyant and Palladio, applying them on our data was generally smooth. We went much more into depth on how to use these tools during class time, and were able to experiment with them using the excel sheets provided on Moodle. In the second assignment, we generated a network of data using Palladio from our own texts. We were testing out the software to decide whether to use it in later stages of our project. Using Palladio was straightforward and all of us were able to obtain adequate networks. Moving on to using textual analysis tools, we experimented with Voyant using our texts and the results looked promising. We have considered using Voyant for the entirety of the project, but we are also brainstorming on what words/phrases to use to experiment with AntConc. Generally, the network and textual analysis tools gave us no major issues. With the help of Dr. Jarkas’ feedback, guidance, and our continuous efforts, all of the tools we have learned will hopefully intertwine in our final presentation through Timeline JS.  We are all tired of studying online and would love to return to campus one day, especially with graduation being so near. Online semesters at AUB during the pandemic have been excessively tiring and difficult. Despite our clinical rotations at the hospital and our constant visits to AUBMC as Nursing students, we were still deprived of the essence of living our university life, and especially our senior year, to the fullest. Practicing certain skills with no real life application or live interaction proved to be certainly challenging and required twice the effort in order to acquire the needed dexterity. In addition, many of our classes were prerecorded and so all we would do during the day was watch 2-3 hours of recorded lectures without any interaction. This also deprived us of the chance to meet new people and make new friends through social interactions as we went from physically engaging with others to being just random individuals behind computer screens.  Lastly, and thankfully for us, ENGL 256B  is an enjoyable course that hasn't changed that much from when it was on campus. Why is this the case? Because most of the assignments on Twitter, Wordpress/Google Sites, Timeline JS and many more were already assigned as online assignments.  If anything, ENGL 256B is one of the courses that excelled during the pandemic due to the dependency of everyone, including the students, on social media. Although it made us stay on our laptops, it made us discover the endless limitations of digital humanities. During this course, all classes were interactive, with cameras on and direct conversations with the instructor. Dr. Jarkas has been very helpful and explains in details how things work and what is required from us at all times. We were not just passively watching the sessions, instead, we endeavored to use the different DH tools to generate digital data. The course does not contain exams and anti-cheating protocols but integrates beneficial group work as its most essential form of collaboration. One of the main differences in this course is that social interaction with one’s colleagues is preserved. We got to meet our colleagues from the introductory videos posted at the beginning of the semester and from the weekly sessions we hold. Also, we even interacted with colleagues from other sections through Twitter, and were updated  with their outcomes and their own beneficence from this course. As a group, we were also fortunate enough to meet in this course  since we went from being just a bunch of classmates  into actual friends.  References: Burgess, S., & Sievertsen, H. H.

Schedule;"This talk will examine the emerging areas of research in Digital Humanities in India by an examination of the term “Digital Humanities” and its uneven and uncertain trajectory in the Indian research ecosystem. As with other systems around the world, DH in India is complex and contextual and each of us involved in the disciplinary practice encounter resistance and skepticism.  Resistance to what is perceived as a deliberate distancing from the larger Humanities queries, scepticism about appropriating the rhetoric of STEM disciplines merely as a tool for greater legitimacy and validation. But of course DH is far more than a sum of its criticisms and scepticisms. I will address why it is imperative that the digital be harnessed, critiqued, deconstructed and dissected precisely so that the issues that Humanities scholars have been invested in continue to be at the centre of the development, deployment and dissemination of technology.   The Swedish Caribbean Colonialism 1784–1878 project (SweCarCol) integrates, orders and opens up important dispersed archives for research by publishing them on the Internet in cooperation with Uppsala University Library.      The paper describes and discusses a series of DH projects that have developed at CESTA and have addressed major issues in the history of the Atlantic World, including slavery and the experience of enslaved and freed persons in particular.   International, interdisciplinary spaces are inevitably sites of tension, where differences in linguistic and cultural norms run deeper than they initially appear. Establishing and maintaining a set of norms for a community to operate despite these differences requires ongoing dialogue within that community. This talk will reflect on language as one longstanding axis of diversity within digital humanities as it is carried out at the international level, as well as within different national contexts. This context will inform a frank discussion of the ways in which a general obliviousness towards languages commonly found in Anglophone countries has negatively impacted Anglophone scholars' research, pedagogy, and engagement with the broader field of DH. The talk will conclude with actionable steps that scholars, particularly in Anglophone countries, can take towards embracing language as an important axis of diversity.   While projects focused on Black culture, texts and artifacts are not as rare as they once were there remains a lack of understanding of the rich and deep histories of Black DH and its impact on the field. Sharon Leon’s foundation chapter, “Complicating a ‘Great Man’ Narrative of Digital History in the United States,” serves as a model of the necessary documentation that scholars must compile of alternative histories of digital humanities. Accordingly, this talk will document a deep dig into the ecology of digital humanities, centering Black DH work in the field. Among the scholars’ work discussed will be Abduhl Alkalimat, creator of e-black studies, Bryan Carter, Virtual Harlem, Marilyn Miller Thomas-Houston, iBlack Studies and co-editor of the multi-media journal Fire!!, Ronald Bailey, who developed www.dignubia.org and www.nubianet.org and Afro Publishing without Walls, and Maryemma Graham, History of Black writing. An ongoing project, I am conducting interviews with such foundational Black dh scholars to better understand their contributions to the field.  This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion we will broaden the question to digital humanities, and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalised in digital humanities discourse.  This talk has two parts. It will first attempt to frame what a history of digital history might look like, by focusing on hybridity as a key characteristic of historical research, seen as some form of integrating newly emerging tools, technologies, materials, and/or practices in historical research, and mapped and qualified according to the main phases of historical research. My main argument here is that, in order to ground our current ‘digital’ practices and learn from past experiences and expertise, we need an answer to the question: what were, and are, the continuities and ruptures in the use and uptake of new technologies in historical research, and in the debates that accompanied them?
		The paper will then proceed to outline what groundwork is necessary to explore digital history’s forgotten roots: a basic overview of the field’s different spatio-temporal trajectories and the networks of computing historians in the pre-PC and early PC period. A key focal point for such a reconstruction are the DH conferences that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, either as singular events or strands of bigger conferences such as the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Moscow in 1970, and later those that were organised under the aegis of the Association for History and Computing (AHC, 1987-2001) and its national member organisations. By studying which scholars attended and where they came from, and by linking that to the topics and methods that were discussed, it will be possible to chart, over time, shifting geographical, topical and methodological developments.
	In the second part of my paper, I will provide the first results of a concrete case study which is part of this broader endeavour, namely a web archaeology of the old AHC website and H-NET Discussion List for History and Computing (now: H-DigitalHistory).  The Digital Humanities have profoundly altered the way that humanities scholars work, research, and teach. While the introduction of computational methods, from GIS, to Digital Archives, to Text Mining, have opened up new fields to practitioners, these fields have also changed the social fabric of the humanities. Although the myth of the lone scholar, toiling away in their office, or in the archives, remains deeply embedded in the psyche of the discipline, the growing influence of the Digital Humanities has begun to offer scholars other opportunities for research work and teaching. Not only are our new methods collaborative by nature, they are often collaborative by necessity, frequently requiring us to work in teams that can leverage different experience and skills towards a set of research goals. In this talk, I want to explore the ramifications of this shift in research practice, focusing on the sociology of the humanities lab, as distinct from both the science laboratory, and the traditional practices of History, Classics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Literary Study. How has the collaborative nature of our work altered the kinds of research that we can produce? How has interdisciplinary cooperation challenged ideas of evidence, method and results in the humanities? How has the collaborative model of research changed our pedagogy? What new kinds of equality, and inequality, between faculty, staff and students, has this change enabled? And what does it mean to work collaborative in fields whose institutional structures persist in disincentivizing collaboration? Drawing on my own experience working at, and directing, the Stanford Literary Lab, an ongoing collaborative research group that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, I want to focus on the outstanding questions that we are only now beginning to address around this radical shift in the humanities.

Digital Humanities Research and Study| ARMACAD;"Thousands of study and academic opportunities in Digital Humanities are available internationally. Conferences and summer schools in Digital Humanities are organized regularly in the best academic centers of the world. The majority of universities and many foundations also offer BA, MA and PhD programs in Digital Humanities as wells as postdoctoral research grants, awards and fellowships. Below you will find the updated list of international opportunities available in Digital Humanities. Digital Humanities takes the modern development of technologies and computation to the spheres of art, culture, history, and other important aspects of human life. Generally, it can be described as the classic study of humanities, developed and integrated into the modern data collecting and analyzing tools. Through digital humanities, scholars attempt to answer the old questions in a new way. Particularly, scholars continue to explore humans and their origin. However, the methods of exploration have completely gone digital. The formation of the digital humanities as a phenomenon lay on two basic foundations. Firstly, around 40 years ago, the technological advancements which helped us store the physical materials came to the stage. People were able to create digital databases for the materials that traditionally served as the only source of examining human past and origin: texts, artworks, artifacts, cultural objects, etc.  Later, computers were enriched with not only storage capacities but also with statistical and analytical programming tools. That was the origin of digital humanities when scholars not only saved but also used and analyzed the vast volumes of data about the past's cultural heritage.  The current digital humanities are about making the texting data out of the massive pool of digitized information from sources like libraries and museums. Later, it's about data manipulation tools to find patterns in the data, analyze it and translate it into new theoretical knowledge. Also, digital humanities help us to create many innovations for current and future life. For example, the recent digital imaging advancements made it possible to produce high-quality reproductions of saved books and artworks. This, in turn, may transform the way people learn from these materials in the future.  Digital Humanities might not sound to you as a popular discipline, the way economics, business, management, and other similar do. However, this academic direction is intensively developing throughout recent years, and there are many universities where you can find DH educational programs. The scholarship list above might even help you study some of those programs at lower or no costs.  A unique thing about digital humanities is that it is usually taught at the Master's level, and there are significantly fewer Bachelor's courses for it.  You might guess that DH studies cover two main study areas: Humanities and Computer Science. Similarly, the basic skills of the mentioned two areas are the program's main admissions requirements. If you don't have a chance to study at Bachelor's of Digital Humanities, your chances to do it in Master's significantly increase if you hold the completion certificate of Bachelor's in Humanities or Bachelors in Computer Sciences.  The course titles might differ in particular universities, but usually, the digital humanities program covers the following main subjects: During many DH programs, students can have a working period in places like museums, libraries, galleries, etc. It is a great way to utilize theoretical knowledge in practice and generally understand what direction of DH careers is closer to you. This practice is offered to students under the ""Work Placement"" course subject, and it would be a good idea to check its availability before applying to the university.  The standard courses within the complete academic program of digital humanities have the following breakdown of course subjects: Before listing where you can utilize your digital humanities skills, let's go through the main skills you will acquire during the studies. Those include: Aside from all these, students of digital humanities receive solid training for writing and presentation skills and creative problem-solving. Without the mentioned skills, all the genuinely massive analytical work with the data will remain useless. Students should be able to identify the logical cues between data hints and real-life questions. Also, they should be able to effectively communicate their findings within the team and collaborate for more fundamental findings.  It sounds like the discipline will grant you the most up-to-date and competitive skills. Therefore, the range of career applications for DH is also high. It's worth mentioning that usually, pure humanity studies are considered a weak base for finding employment in the future. That's because classic studies of humanities are too theoretical, and students usually graduate with many soft skills. In this regard, Digital humanities add hard competitive skills to traditional humanities studies and significantly increase the qualification of the graduates.  So, the leading career perspectives of DH majors include: Also, you can freely work in traditional IT jobs like Web Developers, Mobile Developers, UI/UX Developers, Data Managers, Metadata Managers, Digital Resources Specialists, etc.  Digital Humanities is one of the most interesting disciplines, both in terms of the idea behind it and its main tools and methodologies. We hope this section of ARMACAD will open doors to try yourself in the sphere and gift society with new and amazing findings.

PROJECT: Digital Humanities Net/Works ← dh+lib;"where the digital humanities and librarianship meet Launched in December 2020 through the University of Buffalo Libraries, Digital Humanities Net/Works is an online forum and journal that offers opportunities for the “the exchange of ideas among DH practitioners on the most significant questions or issues in our field and on ways to rethink technology and online structures in order to make them more responsive to issues of diversity and inclusion.” Further,  The DH Net/Works constitutes a digital experiment in networking, beyond the blog, more flexible than the journal, and oriented toward initiating structures of change. Like a journal, it has an editor and advisory board; like a blog, it allows relatively simple entry into the conversation, quick response turn-around, and strong encouragement to include a diversity and range of voices. DH Net/Works takes as its platform and focus both the “net”/internet and the products and agency of our “works,” the activity of our research and digital productivity and what we hope may become a growing community of scholars thinking and working collaboratively to make digital systems, structures, and algorithms as open, accessible, and equitable as possible. The premium in DH Net/Works editorial oversight (Editorial Principles) is on openness of scholarly exchange, adhering to principles of equity and diversity, and maintaining an atmosphere of respect, leading ideally toward possibilities for collaborative thinking and action. It constitutes a digital experiment in networking, beyond the blog, more flexible than the journal, and oriented toward initiating structures of change. Obviously, this includes openness to change and experimentation on the DHN/W site itself, which is continually in process. DH Net/Works represents an important dynamic experiment not only in digital publishing, but also as an effort towards collectivity and open collaboration amongst DH practitioners.  This post was produced through a cooperation between Anne Donlon, Colleen Farry, Tierney Gleason, David Gustavsen, Jennifer Hootman, Jill Krefft, and Jennifer Matthews (Editors-at-Large for the week), Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara (Editor for the week), and Caitlin Christian-Lamb, Alasdair Ekpenyong, Linsey Ford, and Pamella Lach (dh+lib Review Editors). about dh+lib | ISSN 2380-1255 (online)";https://dhandlib.org/2021/04/15/project-digital-humanities-net-works/;

In this meeting, they introduced their doctoral thesis. 
 Ali Şir Nevâyî and Garâibü's-Sıgar  The main points of my thesis are the Chagatay field of Old Turkish literature, Ali Şir Nevâyî, the greatest poet of this field, and his diwan named Garâibü's-Sıgar. Old Turkish literature is the branch of Turkish literature that has been kneaded with the influence of Arabic and Persian literatures with the adoption of Islam. Chagatay Turkish and literature made with this Turkish is the branch of Old Turkish literature that developed in Central Asia.
And this branch will give its best examples in Ali Şir Nevâyî's verses from the second half of the 15th century. That is, Ali Şir Nevâyî is one of the Chagatay poets of Old Turkish literature. Garâibü’s-Sıgar is the diwan of Ali Şir Nevâyî, which contains poems written in his childhood.


Ali Şir Nevâyî, who shaped Chagatay poetry, which is the branch of Classical Turkish Poetry developing in Central Asia, is one of the greatest poets of the whole world literature, accepted as masters by both Eastern and Western Turkish poets with his original dreams in his poems, strong style and competence in using the language.
He wrote his works with a national linguistic consciousness. He is a precious person who is known not only in the environment where he was born and lived, but also in the whole Turkish world, whose fame went beyond the ages.
Nevâyî, a poet, scholar and statesman who helped the formation and development of classical Chagatay literature, contributed to our cultural world with more than thirty works he wrote. Among all these works, first of all, it is necessary to mention his works named Mecâlisü'n-Nefâis and Muhâkemetü'l-Lugateyn, where he tried to prove the superiority of Turkish over Persian.
The poet has classified his Turkish poems into childhood, youth, middle age and old age.
1.         Garā’ibü’s-Sıgar,
2.         Nevādirü’ş-Şebāb,
3.         Bedāyi’u’l-Vasat,
4.         Fevāyidü’l-Kiber,
However, these denominations are a continuation of a tradition. In other words, poems in the poems are not separated by a certain age restriction. There is no difference in beauty and competence between the poems he wrote in childhood and the ones he wrote in old age. A poem in which the poet mentions his gray hair can also be found in the diwan where his childhood poems take place.
The work we are working on among these diwans is the diwan named Garâibü's-Sıgar, which consists of poems that the poet said he wrote during his childhood -up to the age of twenty.
In our thesis, based on the study named ""Alī Şīr Nevāyī Garâ'ibü’s-Sıgar, Review-Comparative Text, Ankara: TDK Publications, 2003"" prepared by Prof. Dr. Günay Kut.
As a result,
- The most important element that makes up classical Turkish poetry is imagination. For centuries, poets have pursued how to find original dreams while using common expression, and how to express these dreams in the best way by constructing them with the most beautiful words in the language. In our study, we focus on the artistic side of Ali Şir Nevâyî.
Thus, we will be able to evaluate how classical poetry uses this common material and its success in this through Garâ’ibü’s-Sıgar. In addition, we will be able to observe the effects of Garaibü’s-Sıgar both in its own field and in the Anatolian field both during and after its transfer.
- The full text of the divan will be created by completing the words and incomplete couplets with comparative studies.
- By examining Nevâyî's vocabulary, language and style features through Garâ’ibü’s-Sıgar, he will be able to draw his poet portrait.
 The Cosmological Elements in Ali-Shir Nava’i’s Turkish Diwans
   Writing a PhD thesis is a rocky road, especially determining the main subject of the thesis. As I know this truth, I try to explain the main points of my thesis. I’ve focused on my thesis cosmology and cosmological elements in Ali-Shir Navayi’s Turkish Diwans. So, my thesis is a basic example of interdisciplinary studies. I want to establish a mutual relation with cosmology and literature, especially classical Turkish and Cagatay literature.


Cosmology is a scientific field that is concerned about the whole universe. Literature is a discipline which uses words and involves cosmology, theology, history, politics, art, sociology, psychology and all things about human beings. This multi-layer status of literature is the starting point of my thesis. I’ve been making use of the method of the thesis which name is “The Cosmical Elements of Some Turkish Poets at Turkish Diwans in 16th Century” and written by Prof. Dr. Sebahat Deniz.

Ali-Shir Nava’i (9 February 1441-3 January 1501), who is the biggest poet of Chagatay literature has made a big contribution to Turkish culture as a poet and as a statesman. Ali-Shir Nava’i who had taken a good education and have knowledge of different science has reflected his knowledge in his works successfully. Ali-Shir Nava’i lived at the same time Ulug Beg and Ali Kuşçu who are the most important people of Turkish astronomy history. 15th Century is the most productive time for Muslim-Turkish scientist in astronomy. Ali-Shir Nava’i’s poems analyzed with regard to vocabulary, imagination variety and extended metaphor, amazing scenes are seen. An amazing scene of these is uses of cosmological elements in his works, frequently. The most beautiful examples of this uses are seen in his Turkish diwans. So the poems of these diwans are very succesfully as literal form and techniques. In the view of this information, my thesis aims will be determined uses of cosmological elements in Turkısh dıwans of Ali-Shir Nava’i and will be tried to explain Ali Şîr Nevâyî’s artistic creativity about universe.
 [People] are becoming increasingly connected by the growth of affordable mobile (smart) technology. It is necessary to think upon new and innovative ways for acquiring, engaging and servicing these “connected consumers”. The goal of the project is to encourage society to become more involved in identification, preservation, and consumption of cultural heritage by developing training programs and educational materials for libraries via Massive Open On-line Course (MOOC) thus promoting or contributing in re-designing existing and co-creating innovative services in cultural heritage institutions.The project consortium consists of six organizations from which two are libraries. Strong academic background for adult education tools and methods will be provided by three universities:Tallinn University, Hacettepe University and Universite De Marne La Vallee.

Please note that the number of participants will be limited. For questions, Lee Ann Glowzenski: laglowzenski@gmail.com and Julia Bleakney: jbleakney@elon.edu.


WLN: A Journal of Writing Center Scholarship invites participants to its inaugural Manuscript Writing Bootcamp (100% online). Meeting once a week for 8 weeks through June-July 2021, the WLN Manuscript Writing Bootcamp will give you time and support to get an entire first draft of a manuscript written and submitted to WLN for review. We recognize how hard it can be to carve out time for research and writing during these challenging times, and we hope the WLN Manuscript Writing Boot Camp will give potential WLN authors the support and structure needed to write a manuscript draft.
Who should attend?
You are working on an article that you believe would be a good fit for WLN, or have already submitted a manuscript to WLN and are going through the revision process. Writers working on RAD-projects as well as non-RAD or narrative-based projects are welcome. Those who have some data or research in hand, are members of underrepresented groups, or are previously unpublished in WLN are encouraged to apply.
When?
The bootcamp will run for 8 weeks through June and July. Bootcamp leaders (coeditors of WLN) and all participants meet once a week for 2-3 hours. We’ll make a final decision on the day and time with the confirmed participants, though it will be a week day (not Saturday or Sunday).
What’s the format?
During the first meeting in June, we’ll provide an overview of the review and publishing process for WLN. We’ll also gauge your needs for additional support (e.g. numerical analysis, coding schemes, etc.) Each subsequent week, we’ll do a check-in at the beginning and end of each bootcamp and the rest of the time is for participants to get some productive writing done in a supportive environment. Bootcamp leaders will offer two or three informal workshops on topics of interest, if needed, and invite you to give periodic feedback to a “boot camp buddy”– another participant in the bootcamp. Leaders will also be available to meet with you once or twice during the bootcamp and to read draft sections.*
What’s the cost?
There is no cost except for your time. We ask that you commit to completing the bootcamp.
How do I sign up?
Please complete this application form by May 3: https://tinyurl.com/WLNbootcamp
** Please note: We cannot guarantee that participation in the bootcamp will result in an accepted publication, as all manuscripts go through an external, rigorous peer-review process. We will limit the number of participants if we get a lot of interest.

Home | Mysite;"Home About Themes Schedule Bibliography More Ecologies Entrelacées Unearthing and Reimagining Gender and Environment in the Francophone Caribbean While the Caribbean may be perceived as beautiful and lush, the history and legacies of colonization in the region reveal a complicated underside. Colonialism and capitalism have shaped relationships between humans and land, tying patterns of domination to both environment and gender. It is critical to understand this history when considering the overt effects of climate change today, and it is crucial to include the humanities and social sciences in these discussions. ​ This bilingual digital humanities project aims to interrogate questions of capitalism, colonialism, gender, and environment in the Francophone Caribbean. The project’s goal is to uncover nuanced ways in which narratives of ecology and gender have been systematically suppressed and reduced—and conversely, to examine how these same narratives continuously resist and disorder dominant structures of power. To do this, we will look at four subtopics: sugar, bananas, beaches, and gardens. These commodities and spaces that are foundational to common imaginaries of the Caribbean. But they are also symbols of more complex histories, representing the direct social, cultural, and ecological consequences. Dr. Schuyler Esprit will present, ""Heartland: An Almanac for Caribbean Futures"", which is an exploration of agriculture, astronomy, and climate through her geneological history and her family's once thriving banana farm. Dr. Esprit is the Founder of Create Caribbean, the first digital humanities center in the Caribbean. She is a Caribbean Studies scholar and her research on the Caribbean has been diverse. She has more than ten years’ experience in university teaching and administration and has taught academic writing, research methods and Caribbean and postcolonial literature and culture. More specifically, her areas of scholarly interest include Caribbean cultural studies, environmental and ecological humanities, and digital scholarship and new media in the Caribbean. She is a writer and editor, and her work has appeared in a range of academic and popular publications including Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, archipelagos journal, and Moko Magazine.

President Biden Will Give Each American A Free Minor In Digital Humanities From SUNY Oswego - ABSOLUTE GENERAL NEWS;"Publisher - ABSOLUTE GENERAL NEWS DAILY

  More than 44 million Americans share a collective debt burden of $ 1.5 trillion, and that number is only growing because of skyrocketing tuition fees and high interest rates.  Fortunately, President Biden has just signed an ordinance that will make life a lot easier for Americans pursuing a college degree: the government will now give every American a free minor in Digital Humanities from SUNY Oswego. Brilliant!  In a press conference today, Biden announced that all US citizens over the age of 18 will soon receive a diploma certifying the completion of 18 Digital Humanities Credits at SUNY Oswego.  With millions of Americans struggling to make payments on their student loans, a free minor who shows they’ve completed courses such as Fundamentals of Digital Imagery and Ethics and Social Policy in the Digital Age will keep our next generation from doing the sort of thing Crippling is stuck in debts the generation before them endured.  “Students who would have taken out thousands of dollars in college education can now instead save their money and use their Digital Humanities minor to help secure employment opportunities that include skills such as digital text analysis, digital mapping and web design,” said he the president.  “At the very least, these minors should qualify all Americans for internships that, while not full-time positions, definitely provide the workplace experience and networking necessary to build a career in the field.” If that wasn’t big enough, Biden went on to say that he will help those who have already amassed college debt by giving them a Dean’s List certificate stating that their accumulated GPA is at least in their Digital Humanities Minor a was 3.8 and by receiving an award entitled “The Mark C. Heller Award for Excellence in the Digital Humanities” to Americans with a student loan of more than $ 100,000. This is so great!  A free Digital Humanities minor from one of the best SUNY satellite campuses will contribute so much to the many Americans who otherwise would have gone to college that they will face terrible credit scores and payments that they simply could not afford.

Toward an Ecosystem of the Syriac Digital Humanities: An Interview with George A. Kiraz, 5th and Final Part – The Digital Orientalist;"The Digital Orientalist Practical examples and theoretical reflections on the do's and don'ts of using digital tools for your study and research in African and Asian Studies. This is the sixth and final post of a series by the Digital Orientalist’s Syriac Studies Editor, Ephrem Ishac, based on his interview with George A. Kiraz. The introduction to the series can be viewed here, the first part here, the second part here, and the third part here.The Digital Orientalist began to serialize this interview between Syriac Studies Editor, Ephrem Ishac, and Dr. George A. Kiraz in early 2020. Following an introduction to the Syriac Digital Humanities, the first part of the interview focused on Dr. Kiraz’s interest in computers and the beginnings of his journey in the Digital Humanities. The second part focused on Dr. Kiraz’s interest in printing and the creation of Gorgias Press. The third part explored the Beth Mardutho (The Syriac Institute) and ecumenical approaches to Syriac heritage. The fourth part focused on early ideas for digitizing Syriac manuscripts. The final part explores ongoing projects in Beth Mardutho.  Meeting of Syriaca.org at Beth Mardutho.  Ephrem: Now we reach our last three questions! Could you tell us shortly and generally about the ongoing projects on the Syriac digital humanities that you are involved with, especially those projects that Beth Mardutho has been hosting? G. Kiraz: Yes, so if you visit bethmardutho.org you will see the various projects that we are engaged in on the homepage, including the online encyclopedia e-GEDSH which is encoded in TEI, XML and eXist-db. We have also Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies, which is one of the earliest open-source journals in the digital humanities. It is also encoded in TEI and XML and run by James E. Walters. We also have SEDRA – a lexicographical database that I mentioned previously. Finally, there is the project that we are currently very excited about – Qoruyo. Qoruyo seeks to create OCR and handwriting recognition models to turn printed books and manuscripts into searchable texts. Alongside there is Thesaurus: SIMTHO which is a small project, but currently contains over six million words and is growing. We now have over 50,000 pages of PDF files and we are starting our second phase of OCR-ing these documents. Of course, this is a project that will take many years complete, but the aim is to have a large Syriac linguistic corpus that people can use in their research. I use these tools myself on a weekly basis for various purposes.  The history of Syriac Computing.  Homepage for Thesaurus: SIMTHO.  Ephrem: I know that it’s difficult to ask if a father has a favorite child, but can you talk more about your oldest – and perhaps ‘favorite’ baby, SEDRA? Currently we have SEDRA IV. What is the future of SEDRA? G. Kiraz: I think the future of SEDRA and the other projects at Beth Mardutho need to move in the direction of integration. The vision is to have the lexical and textual resources linked with the editions of texts, manuscripts, and manuscripts catalogs; to move toward having a digital ecosystem of Syriac studies. This is also the vision of syriaca.org, which is led by David A. Michelson and his colleagues. So, the vision is to have a network of portals that can communicate with each other through an API. That’s where we would like to go with all these things that we have been developing.  Developments in SEDRA announced at Syriaca.org‘s Workshop in 2017.  A floppy disc contained some of Brockelman’s Lexicon for SEDRA.  Ephrem: Do I understand that you think it would be much better if we work together with our different projects in Syriac studies? In other words, is it better that we harmonize our work on different projects in Syriac digital humanities to integrate all these projects at a certain point? G. Kiraz: Sure! I very much encourage everyone to go with the platform that they prefer, but it would be beneficial if it was a platform that has an API which can communicate with other platforms. Let’s say, for example, that you have a catalogue of manuscripts and you’re writing the titles and the colophons and you can easily link it with SEDRA, then anybody who is on your catalog could  on a word and discover its meanings or  on a word and go find its occurrences in the SIMTHO database. So, if your catalogue has an API, then we can talk to your catalog in the future and everybody can talk to each other in the world of digital humanities.  Syriaca.org  Ephrem: That leads us to our last question – Do you think that our digital humanities projects should be based some principles such as sharing our databases for the sake of developing the Syriac digital humanities? Can you say some final words on projects which choose to close their databases rather than opening them to be shared with others? G. Kiraz: Unless there are some motivations based on necessity, I don’t think it is a good idea to develop closed projects and I believe it will likely introduce limitations into the project. Of course, open projects can also face limitations. Most of our projects at Beth Mardutho are run by volunteers and are limited by funding possibilities. If you have a project with limited funded, you need to think what will happen to the database once the period of funding has finished. We also need to consider what happens to our data both after a project and also during it – what happens to the data if the investigator is the victim of an accident or illness, for example. There are some possible resolutions such as the aforementioned linking of our portals through APIs, but it doesn’t stop there because there is also the raw data to think about.  Kiraz lecturing on digital humanities for the MA programme in Syriac Theology – Salzburg, 2017.  If you have a database, then it is implemented under some system, it could be PHP: MySQL. It could be Microsoft SQL. It could be some other open access database; but at some point it has some sort of a format. It’s not a file that I can print on a piece of paper and access the raw data of. So, it is crucially important that people export their data periodically, take snapshots of it, and transfer the raw materials into Unicode files, simple flat files, or XML files – readable files in an accessible format that can be printed. Have it in that format and put it somewhere periodically (like Github), so that if your project stops, if you cannot continue, then your work is not wasted. That’s my advice to people and is what we do with our projects. The plan for SEDRA, which of course has an API, is to periodically output all of the data and put it online. That means somebody else can take it and create their own SEDRA if they want to, and they’re more than welcome to do so. The same thing goes for the source text of SIMTHO. Of course, when it comes to SIMTHO, there are some things that necessitate closure. For example, publishers would object to their text being released – there are the copyright laws and you cannot break the law, but when there are things that are in the public domain you can do it. Ephrem: That’s very helpful and I hope that this can clarify the mission of ongoing and future projects in Syriac digital humanities. tawdi sagi Malphono! G. Kiraz: Lo medem!

"- Aufbauseminar: Digital Humanities - Your student research project
				Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf";Overview This seminar is a free research seminar. Participants design and conduct together (up to two team members) or alone a research project.   Aim Organization and structure What are Digital Humanities? Of course, we’ll talk about this in our first seminar lecture. However, for everyone who does not know the concept in general the following information is given: Digital humanities is quite a young discipline still in the process of a proper definition. ”[..] concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It is methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form. It studies how these media affect the disciplines in which they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to our knowledge of computing” (Kirschbaum, 2010). However, this definition goes back to a Wikipedia entry, as Kirschbaum and several other researchers denote. Besides this first working definition, the project ”What is digital humanities?” (Link: https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) provides over 800 self-reported definitions giving further first impressions. The goal of this course is to develop your own scientific project. You will present your progress each week to discuss it with the other students. The execution of the project (e.g. collecting survey data or conducting interviews) is not a mandatory part of the curriculum as this would be too time intensive. If you already have some ideas, please present them during our first meeting. However, this is not a requirement, as we will develop a project idea together. The thematic areas possible to study are: If these areas are not familiar to you, we invite you to inform yourself beforehand to gather inspiration for your research project. Possible project examples:   Reference Kirschbaum, M. G. (2010). What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments? ADE Bulletin, 150, 1-7.

;"An ADHO Special Interest Group A survey to gauge the interest of the community for a technical mentorship program. As a result of the DHTech survey it came to our attention that quite a number of people said they were working in DH as single programmers. Additionally, many people doing coding related work in DH don’t have a formal computer science degree but are self-taught or taught on the job. For RSEs in such a situation it can be challenging to get guidance and support in all phases of a project; be it the project planning phase, where knowledge of existing tools and workflows can greatly improve the reusability and long-term accessibility, or during the actual software development phase, where a simple question sometimes takes a day to answer (we have all been there!). Thus, the idea formed to develop a technical mentoring program that provides mentees with a technical mentor who can answer questions and can offer guidance on, for example, design and infrastructure questions. Such a program would not be a replacement for training or workshops that teach specific skills, but could support people doing technical work in DH by providing a means to have low frequency but high quality conversations with experienced RSEs. Of course, such a system of mentoring could also be valuable for more experienced RSEs who enter into a new field such as data modelling or 3D visualizations. There are several questions that need to be answered to successfully implement a technical mentorship program. How could such a program give appropriate credit and recognition for mentors (e.g. acknowledgement in publications or on websites, allocation in institutional workload)? What would be the expectations of mentee and mentor? How would mentor and mentee be matched? How much time should a mentor commit to the program? We plan to work on providing a guide to these questions in the next few weeks. Anyone interested in joining the discussion is welcome to join us on Slack. The first step, however, will be to gauge the interest of the community for such a program. For this purpose, we have created a short survey that can be accessed here. If you would consider becoming a mentor or a mentee, please fill out the form. Filling out the form is not a commitment to either yet, just an indication of interest. If there is enough interest in the community for a technical mentorship program, we will follow up with a registration process at a later time. Powered by  Jekyll

USM Set to Host Inaugural Digital Humanities Conference | The University of Southern Mississippi;"Mon,
                  								04/05/2021 - 14:49pm | By: Van Arnold In an effort to explore cutting edge research in digital humanities, The University
                  of Southern Mississippi (USM) will host an inaugural conference titled, Digital Lagniappe, in a virtual format on Friday, April 16. The conference will take place over Zoom
                  and anyone interested in digital humanities is invited to attend.
                The conference includes five interactive roundtables featuring leading DH scholars
                  from across the United States and the United Kingdom as they discuss their work and
                  how DH methodologies help them advance related research.
                The conference also includes a special presentation on some new technology in the
                  field - DataScribe - that offers new approaches for transcription creation and analysis.
                  Throughout the day, attendees will have the opportunity to pose questions about their
                  own work to the panelists in a vibrant exchange of ideas.
                Dr. Susannah Ural, Professor of History at USM, is helping coordinate the conference.
                  She is the Director of her own DH project, “The Civil War & Reconstruction Governors
                  of Mississippi.” Ural is hopeful that this initial event will be the first of many
                  annual DH conferences at USM.
                “We’re bringing together the latest work in the field to help scholars and students
                  learn from each other’s efforts and discuss current challenges in DH,” said Ural,
                  who is also a Co-Director of The Dale Center for the Study of War & Society. “The informal, welcoming nature of the conference also makes it a great place for
                  non-experts to learn about DH and its possibilities in their own work.”
                Digital Humanities is defined as an area of scholarly activity at the intersection
                  of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing
                  scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged
                  research, teaching, and publishing.
                Ural invites readers with questions to reach out to her or to her conference co-hosts
                  Dr. Stephanie Seal Walters (USM School of Humanities Digital Liaison) or Ms. Maeve
                  Losen (USM DH graduate assistant).

Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed: Anti-Colonial DH Pedagogy as Care Work – Humanities Commons;"Open access, open source, open to all Public Group  61 Members This space is the repository for the papers, presentations (slides, videos, etc) that will form the basis of the CSDH-SCHN 2021 online conference, to take place May 30-June 3rd. As scholars of colour with contingent access to and precarious movements within privileged academic spaces, we began the Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed collective because we were witnessing and experiencing the colonial, white supremacist oppressions built into mainstream computer systems and, relatedly, replicated in the field of mainstream digital humanities (DH). Engaging with and guided by the work of Black, Indigenous, racialized, queer, feminist, and disabled scholars who are writing and speaking out about these issues (Ansloos; Bailey; Benjamin; Brocke; Duarte; Francisco-Menchavez; Freire; Hamraie; Kim; McKittrick; Noble; Phillips; Piepzna-Samarasinha; Risam; Wemigwans), we hoped to foster a community of thinkers who sought to work together to imagine-into-being a liberating “otherwise” for DH, and to support one another through the challenges of creating that “otherwise” — an otherwise that nurtures the ethics of what these citations might bring to the classroom, of what their material entanglements might do, of where and with whom we practice our scholarship.  As we will discuss in this paper, Covid-19 has brought into overt and urgent view the immense systemic failures of higher education pedagogy for lives already vulnerable and precarious. Amidst the university’s push for “business as usual,” we find ourselves asking: What do messages of safety or of “being safe” mean in the context of anti-colonial DH pedagogy as we move our classes and communities entirely online? Following the words of Katherine McKittrick, how can we forget — for all too many of us are forgetting — that many of our students and colleagues already navigated unsafe lives before this global pandemic? Revisiting Dorothy Kim’s teachings on “Race, Social Justice and DH”, how can we overlook the hostility of already popular online spaces to targeted bodies and anti-racist, anti-casteist, and anti-patriarchal classroom and studio conversations? What constitutes the “essentials” of online and remote learning in this pandemic, so that our pedagogies are not merely mediated by elected (or enforced) web platforms but instead are always critical of their capacities for and claims to provide a “safe space” for learning and teaching?  In response to these questions, we have been talking about care work (Piepzna-Samarasinha) and about what anti-colonial DH care work would, could, and should look like. In this paper, we will suggest that, in contrast to the university’s current colonial-capitalist use of digital technology for pandemic learning and knowledge production, or even co-optation of critical digital discourse in the name of care, scholars and educators should engage with digital technology in ways that help to build, organize, and nourish communities of action against colonizing logics and towards greater support, kindness, and sustained care for one another — both in the present pandemic, but also in and for our mutual long-term futures. Our paper will provide an invitation and a call-to-action to foster DH communities that, through deep care work, have the ability to not only dismantle capitalist-colonial systems and capitalist-colonial responses to sociocultural, sociopolitical issues, but also to honour embodied technologies and lived realities in the production of classroom-based DH learning.

At this moment when all of us, suddenly, have become teachers in the digital space, this volume provides the kinds of hands on, practical advice educators need to navigate the complexities of teaching in the digital humanities. Ten years ago, half of the topics covered in these essays wouldn't even be topics of discussion, but today are part of our regular teaching practices. None of us will ever master all aspects of DH teaching, but taken together, the essays in this volume come close. ""I'm not sure I can"". ""I'm not sure my students can."" ""I don't think I'd know where to begin"" ""I don't really see the point, to be honest"". Decades after the emergence of digital humanities, the field can still seem daunting to outsiders and integration to teaching projects remains uneven. That's where this book comes in, presenting a variety of ambitious yet accessible, real-life projects to inspire and embolden. A stepping stone to a new dimension. Featuring a wide variety of examples from educators from across higher-ed, this Quick Hits volume is as useful to educators looking to develop digital humanities classes as it is to more advanced practitioners interested in integrating the latest tools and approaches. By highlighting field-tested methods in digital humanities teaching, the essays collected here will greatly enrich scholars' ability to enhance their curricular interventions, both conceptually and methodologically.  Indiana UniversityBloomington Connect With Us  © 2022 The Trustees of

What the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed - The New York Times;"By Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Anjali Singhvi, Audra D. S. Burch, Troy Griggs, Mika Gröndahl, Lingdong Huang, Tim Wallace, Jeremy White and Josh WilliamsMay 24, 2021 
A century ago, a prosperous Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Okla., perished at the hands of a violent white mob.
 
The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 killed hundreds of residents, burned more than 1,250 homes and erased years of Black success.

	Imagine a community of great possibilities and prosperity built by Black people for Black people. Places to work. Places to live. Places to learn and shop and play. Places to worship.
 
	Now imagine it being ravaged by flames.
 
	In May 1921, the Tulsa, Okla., neighborhood of Greenwood was a fully realized antidote to the racial oppression of the time. Built in the early part of the century in a northern pocket of the city, it was a thriving community of commerce and family life to its roughly 10,000 residents.
 
	Brick and wood-frame homes dotted the landscape, along with blocks lined with grocery stores, hotels, nightclubs, billiard halls, theaters, doctor’s offices and churches.
 
	Greenwood was so promising, so vibrant that it became home to what was known as America’s Black Wall Street. But what took years to build was erased in less than 24 hours by racial violence — sending the dead into mass graves and forever altering family trees.
 
	Hundreds of Greenwood residents were brutally killed, their homes and businesses wiped out. They were casualties of a furious and heavily armed white mob of looters and arsonists. One factor that drove the violence: resentment toward the Black prosperity found in block after block of Greenwood.
 
	The financial toll of the massacre is evident in the $1.8 million in property loss claims — $27 million in today’s dollars — detailed in a 2001 state commission report. For two decades, the report has been one of the most comprehensive accounts to reveal the horrific details of the massacre — among the worst racial terror attacks in the nation’s history — as well as the government’s culpability.
 
	The destruction of property is only one piece of the financial devastation that the massacre wrought. Much bigger is a sobering kind of inheritance: the incalculable and enduring loss of what could have been, and the generational wealth that might have shaped and secured the fortunes of Black children and grandchildren.
 
	“What if we had been allowed to maintain our family business?” asked Brenda Nails-Alford, who is in her early 60s. The Greenwood Avenue shoe shop of her grandfather and his brother was destroyed. “If they had been allowed to carry on that legacy,” she said, “there’s no telling where we could be now.”
 
	For decades, what happened in Greenwood was willfully buried in history. Piecing together archival maps and photographs, with guidance from historians, The New York Times constructed a 3-D model of the Greenwood neighborhood as it was before the destruction. The Times also analyzed census data, city directories, newspaper articles, and survivor tapes and testimonies from that time to show the types of people who made up the neighborhood and contributed to its vibrancy.
 
	Perhaps no other collection of businesses tells the story of Greenwood and Black entrepreneurship better than the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue, rising near the southern tip of the neighborhood. This marquee block was the pulse of the Black business community.
 
More than 70 businesses operated in mostly one-, two- and three-story red brick buildings clustered along the block. All but a couple were owned by Black entrepreneurs.
 
In this stretch alone, there were four hotels, two newspapers, eight doctors, seven barbers, nine restaurants and a half-dozen professional offices of real estate agents, dentists and lawyers. A cabaret and a cigar shop were on the block, too.
 
You could shop for groceries, play pool, take in a theater show, eat dinner or get your hair styled — without ever leaving the block.
 
	“My grandfather often talked about how you could enjoy a full life in Greenwood, that everything you needed or wanted was in Greenwood. You never had to go anywhere,” said Star Williams, 40, the granddaughter of Otis Grandville Clark, who was 18 during the massacre. “He talked about seeing Black success and how his sense of identity and pride came from Greenwood.”
 
	The businesses on Greenwood Avenue were owned by people who were among Tulsa’s most prominent Black citizens.
 
Loula and John Williams came to embody the entrepreneurial spirit of Greenwood. They owned a confectionery at 102 Greenwood Avenue, and the East End Garage around the corner on Archer Street.
 
The couple also owned the 750-seat Williams Dreamland Theatre, at 129 Greenwood Avenue, the first movie house for Black people in the city. It offered both silent films and live shows, and was also a community gathering spot.
 
Dr. R.T. Bridgewater was a physician with a practice in the Woods Building, at 101-105 Greenwood Avenue. He owned 17 rental houses and was also a community leader. The Tulsa Star, a Black-owned newspaper, called his home on the affluent North Detroit Street “palatial.”
 
Several women set up shop as entrepreneurs in the same building. Mary E. Jones Parrish, left, was a teacher and journalist who operated a typing school. Mabel B. Little ran the Little Rose Beauty Salon.
 
Susie Bell ran an upscale restaurant called Bell and Little Cafe with her brother, Presley Little, Ms. Little’s husband. It offered six-course meals that were written about in The Tulsa Star.
 
Buck Colbert Franklin, a lawyer, had an office inside a building owned by O.W. Gurley, one of Greenwood’s founders. After the massacre, Mr. Franklin provided legal services from a tent.
 
James Nails, shown here, and his brother Henry ran a shoe shop in the Gist Building at 121 Greenwood Avenue. The shop carried Black Swan records, and the family also owned a dance pavilion and skating rink in the community.
 
A. J. Smitherman, a journalist and civil rights activist, founded The Tulsa Star, which was headquartered at 126 Greenwood Avenue. The paper reported on stories of racial violence and advocated for the rights of African-Americans.
 
J.B. Stradford, shown with his wife, opened the posh 54-room Stradford Hotel at 301 Greenwood Avenue in 1918. It was considered among the nation’s best hotels for African-Americans at the time.
 
	Mr. Stradford and Mr. Gurley — who purchased large tracts of land in the early  1900s — were among the founders of Greenwood. They began building on the northern side of Tulsa beyond the railroad tracks, forming the bones of the city’s predominantly Black neighborhood that was separate from the white side of town.
 
	Greenwood was one of the few places in the country offering Black citizens — less than six decades out of enslavement —  a three-dimensional life.
 
By 1921, Greenwood had grown into a 35-block neighborhood with a bustling retail scene, as well as two schools, two newspapers and a hospital. Here, some of the community’s key places are shown in orange.
 
Booker T. Washington School, which opened in 1913 with 14 students, had moved into its three-story brick building in 1920. It would serve as a hospital and relief center after the massacre.
 
Mount Zion Baptist Church was among some half-dozen churches that burned. It was the city’s largest Black church.
 
There was also a small juke joint called Zulu Lounge owned by Isaac Evitt, who worked by day on a farm, but after dark, flung open the doors of Zulu.
 
	In the evenings, residents had their choice of entertainment. Survivor accounts that were relayed to relatives recall neighbors getting “gussied up” to gather in Greenwood, with Thursdays being big because of “Maids’ Night Out.” Black domestics, many of them live-in workers who cleaned the homes of white residents across town, were off that day.
 
	Many African-Americans migrated to Tulsa after the Civil War, carrying dreams of new chapters and the kind of freedom found in owning businesses. Others made a living working as maids, waiters, chauffeurs, shoe shiners and cooks for Tulsa’s new oil class.
 
	In Greenwood, residents held more than 200 different types of jobs. About 40 percent of the community’s residents were professionals or skilled craftspeople, like doctors, pharmacists, carpenters and hairdressers, according to a Times analysis of the 1920 census. While a vast majority of the neighborhood rented, many residents owned their homes.

	Segregation kept African-Americans from patronizing white-owned shops, and Greenwood thrived from community support of Black-owned businesses.
 
	“Black folks faced an economic detour,” said Hannibal B. Johnson, an author and the education chair for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission. “When they approached the gates to the wider Tulsa economy, they were turned away, so they ended up creating their own largely insular community.”
 
	The assaults on Greenwood raged over two days. The morning of June 2, 1921 revealed emptiness and ruin in every direction.
 
	Plumes of smoke hovered over the neighborhood. Ash coated the ground. Brick buildings had been reduced to bombed-out husks. And soon, the bodies of those killed would be stacked and discarded in mass graves and a river.
 
	It all began on May 30 with two teenagers in an elevator in the Drexel building in downtown Tulsa and morphed into a sexual assault accusation.
 
	Accounts vary about what happened between Dick Rowland, 19, a young Black shoe shiner, and Sarah Page, 17, a white elevator operator. One common theory suggests Mr. Rowland tripped and grabbed onto the arm of Ms. Page while trying to catch his fall. She screamed, and he ran away, according to the commission report.
 
	The next day, Mr. Rowland was arrested and jailed in the Tulsa County Courthouse. By that afternoon, The Tulsa Tribune published a front-page news story with the headline “Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator,” which essentially mobilized a lynch mob that showed up at the courthouse.
 
	Twice, a group of armed Black Tulsans, many of them World War I veterans, offered to help protect Mr. Rowland but were turned away by the sheriff.
 
	As the Black men were leaving the second time, a white man attempted to disarm a Black veteran, and a gun went off in the scuffle. That clash and others that day marked the beginning of what would become Greenwood’s armed destruction. Some white rioters were even deputized and given weapons by civil officials.
 
	Near dawn, the white mob descended on Greenwood. Black Tulsans fought back, valiantly defending their families and property. But they were woefully outnumbered.

	The mob indiscriminately shot Black people in the streets. Members of the mob ransacked homes and stole money and jewelry. They set fires, “house by house, block by block,” according to the commission report.
 
	Terror came from the sky, too. White pilots flew airplanes that dropped dynamite over the neighborhood, the report stated, making the Tulsa aerial attack what historians call among the first of an American city.
 
	The numbers presented a staggering portrait of loss: 35 blocks burned to the ground; as many as 300 dead; hundreds injured; 8,000 to 10,000 left homeless; more than 1,470 homes burned or looted; and eventually, 6,000 detained in internment camps.
 
	The neighborhood economy was destroyed. Two dozen grocery stores. Thirty-one restaurants. Four drug stores.
 
	Greenwood, where Black success embodied the American dream, was no more, suddenly, dreadfully wiped out.
 
	Greenwood would be rebuilt, and for a few decades, it would again thrive before falling to urban renewal and other forces. But that spring of 1921 unmoored and unrooted the neighborhood with lasting effects.
 
	Not long after the attack, shell-shocked survivors — who were blamed for the violence — returned home to ruin. Amid the charred remnants, they were forced to make an excruciating decision that would change family histories forever: leave and start over again somewhere else, or rebuild.
 
	They also faced another kind of white resistance: a fire ordinance intended to prevent Black property owners from rebuilding on their own and insurance companies that refused to pay damage claims.
 
	“Greenwood wasn’t a gift from anyone, it was created by the citizens of Greenwood who withstood the tragedy of 1921 and rebuilt it again,” said Scott Ellsworth, the author of the recently released book, “The Ground Breaking: An American City and Its Search for Justice.” “Greenwood is the story of resilience. It is the story of courage.”
 
	Those who stayed began stitching their lives back together almost immediately. They joined forces and began rebuilding homes and businesses. Within a day, C.L. Netherland, a massacre survivor and minister whose barber shop at 110 Greenwood Avenue was destroyed, purchased a folding chair, a strop and razor, and set up shop on a sidewalk.
 
	The massacre also claimed the Mount Zion Baptist Church, whose first service in its new building had been held less than two months earlier. The congregation’s hundreds of members had financed and built the $92,000 church over several years, according to “Black Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa’s Historic Greenwood District,” a book by Mr. Johnson, education chair for the centennial commission. It would have been easier to declare bankruptcy. Instead, church members rebuilt and dug in. It took an additional 21 years before the initial debt was repaid.
 
	The final insult of the massacre came in the silence. For decades, Tulsa deliberately ignored and covered up what had happened in Greenwood. Many descendants said they learned about the mob and the killings only as adults — and even then, some of the recounting was told in whispers.
 
	“You could see the pain in my grandmother’s eyes when she talked about what happened,” said LeRoy Gibbs II, 52, the grandson of Ernestine Gibbs, a massacre survivor who was 17 when the violence unfolded. “Before she would get too far, before it became too painful, she would shift and start talking about where we are today.”
 
	Some surviving business owners who built the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue had remarkable second chapters. Others, who struggled in the aftermath, had heartbreaking stories. The Williams family, among the most successful before the massacre, stayed and rebuilt.
 
	Mr. Smitherman, the civil rights activist who ran The Tulsa Star, eventually landed in Buffalo, where he became the publisher of The Buffalo Star (later named The Empire Star). He was among several Black Tulsans indicted for “inciting a riot,” and was exonerated posthumously.
 
	Ms. Parrish, the journalist who ran a typing school, stayed to chronicle the massacre. The two wealthy men who helped found Greenwood were hit hard financially. Mr. Stradford, who was indicted, escaped to Kansas and then Chicago. He never recovered his fortune. Mr. Gurley reportedly lost nearly $158,000 in 1921, or $2.3 million in today’s dollars.
 
	James Nails, who had opened a shoe shop with his brother Henry, rebuilt but never really recovered. He eventually left Tulsa.
 
	“He was really unable to carry on emotionally, psychologically,” Ms. Nails-Alford said. “You get your education, you work hard, you start businesses, you’re able to employ your family members and community members, and then you lose it all within hours. It takes away a man’s dignity.”
 In 1921, a white mob attacked the Greenwood district of Tulsa, killing hundreds of Black people and destroying the neighborhood. Justice has never been served. Can it still be today? 
	There is a pending lawsuit and ongoing discussions about how and whether to compensate the families of the Tulsa Massacre victims. No compensation has ever been paid under court order or by legislation.
 
	To this day, not one person has been prosecuted or punished for the devastation and ruin of the original Greenwood.
 Methodology The buildings, maps and data presented in this article are based on historical records. In as many cases as possible, multiple sources were used to confirm details like the location of businesses and residences. When there were differing accounts or information, The Times used what was cited by  the most sources. The number of killings in the massacre has been estimated to be up to 300, but a precise number was not available. Street addresses of some buildings were numbered in different ways, depending on the source. The 3-D model of Tulsa, Okla., was created using a series of both computerized and manual steps that transformed historical material into digital data. First, we took images of Sanborn insurance maps from 1920 and 1915 and used a process called georeferencing to align them to modern geography. The 1920 maps came from the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum and were used to reconstruct as much of Greenwood and downtown Tulsa as possible. The 1915 maps were from the Library of Congress and were used to fill in other parts of Tulsa, where 1920 maps were not available. Next, we wrote a computer program to extract the building outlines from those maps using a technique called machine learning. We also created an application to input the height information for each building from the Sanborn maps. Archival photographs and maps were used to create a detailed model of the 100 block of Greenwood Avenue. Buildings or parts of buildings without photographic reference are shown without details. The street grid was created by georeferencing a 1921 street map of Tulsa from the Library of Congress. We utilized a combination of optical character recognition and manual data entry to digitize the Polk-Hoffhine Tulsa City Directory from 1921, obtained from the Tulsa City-County Library. Those data were used to analyze and map businesses in Greenwood. Additional businesses were identified using the “Tulsa Colored Business Directory” in The Tulsa Star (1913-21) and The List of Losses published in “Events of The Tulsa Disaster” by Mary E. Jones Parrish. Owners of businesses on the 100 block were identified using The Tulsa Star and accounts of survivors and their descendants. To create the maps of the occupations of African-American residents in Greenwood, we analyzed 1920 U.S. census data from Ancestry.com for residents for which occupation data was recorded. Our analysis included residents who the 1920 census classified as Black or mulatto. We then mapped the homes of thousands of those residents using the 1920 Sanborn maps. Street maps from 1921 and Sanborn maps from 1939 were also used to help map addresses. The addresses of landmarks and other buildings were used to help determine the order of house numbers on a block. In some cases, Open Street Maps was used to locate addresses where the numbering system had not changed. Street name changes from the 1920 and 1921 city directories were incorporated in this process. We categorized occupations into three broad categories: professionals, skilled craftspeople and service workers. Records in which occupations were illegible, or were without a house number or clear address were excluded. While the Greenwood neighborhood boundary is not officially defined, the outline shown in this piece includes the predominantly African-American area shown in the 2001 state commission report as well as some additional areas, based on our analysis of census data.

Cinders in the Sky: The Legacy of the Tulsa Race Massacre · Cinders In the Sky · OKState Library Omeka S;Fires burning along Archer and Greenwood during the massacre It was supposed to be a regular Wednesday morning: the sun would rise, the men would go to work, and the children to school. It was the first day of June and the Oklahoma summer heat was preparing to settle in, the cool breeze of spring banished to the past. With it being the middle of the work week, many families were already asleep, peacefully resting for another day of walking across the Frisco tracks to go work on the white side of Tulsa.  It would have been a normal Wednesday in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, too, if not for the angry white mob that descended upon the affluent Black neighborhood, otherwise known as Black Wall Street. On May 31, Dick Rowland, a Black shoe shiner, was arrested and detained on the top floor of the Tulsa County Court House for allegedly assaulting a woman, Sarah Page, on an elevator the day before. Because of the Tulsa Tribune’s sensationalist headlines, which exaggerated the circumstances of the event, white Tulsans congregated outside the building and pressured the sheriff to turn Rowland over to them—once the fabricated rumors had circulated around town, the white mob was eager to mete out their own version of justice: lynching. In Greenwood, when the Black community learned about what was happening outside the courthouse, some of the men marched over the railroad tracks with guns and ammunition to protect Rowland from the enraged horde desperate to find him. Soon enough, a standoff occurred in Tulsa between the Black community and the white community. But when an unclaimed shot rang out on the square, the anxious silence was shattered. Throughout the night and into the early hours of the morning, skirmishes between armed Black and white men took place on the borders of Greenwood before the white mob surged into the district and wreaked havoc on one of the only wealthy Black neighborhoods that ever existed in the United States. Fearful of a ‘Negro uprising’, an idea rooted in white supremacist ideology, the mob was soon aided by law enforcement officials and began setting Greenwood on fire. Planes circled over buildings and dropped burning turpentine balls on them. When the residents of Greenwood tried to flee their homes, some were shot down by gunfire from white men on board those planes. It was complete and total demolition: great plumes of black smoke choked the skies, parlors and restaurants were razed to the ground, Black citizens were captured and carted off to detention centers. The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 is categorized as one of the worst race massacres the country has ever seen, but has been majorly and purposely erased from the racial history of the United States. With the official death toll undetermined and the two hundred million dollars in economic damages still not repaired, the Greenwood District of Tulsa has never recovered from this attack. As we come upon the hundredth anniversary of this event, this exhibit is designed with an aim to explore and ruminate on the legacy of Greenwood before and after this crisis. What follows is an examination of what the district looked like before it was destroyed with reflections from those who lived through the massacre. We've also included a discussion on the language of how to frame this event, and resources for you to follow to help Greenwood. As you delve into this collection, we ask you to consider the history of Tulsa that is still being devastated by a government’s inadequacy to acknowledge their role in this massacre, and the racial trauma still apparent in the city today.;http://bit.ly/2RKm5Yj;
DARIAH launches an annual Open Access Monograph Bursary for Early Career Researchers in Digital Humanities | DARIAH;DARIAH-EU is launching an annual Open Access Book Bursary for the publication of one’s first monograph within the domain of Digital Humanities. The bursary will fund the Open Access publication of one monograph (or other long form of scholarship) per year.  By doing so, DARIAH-EU aims to further strengthen its long-standing commitment to pave pathways to the open research culture as it specifically pertains to arts and humanities disciplines and  to enable early career researchers, who are usually less privileged in institutional Open Access grants, to openly disseminate their first monographs in book series that are topically most relevant for their field of interest.  In terms of publishing venues, the bursary aims to support community-driven, fair players and therefore publication in a DOAB certified, fair Open Access publication venue with transparent pricing and in alignment with the SPARC Good Practice Principles with Scholarly Communication Services is set as an absolute eligibility criterion. * We use the term ‘monograph’ in a sense that it includes all long forms of scholarship. Exploring and supporting pathways into the open research culture for Arts and Humanities scholars is among the strategic commitments of DARIAH. One of the most complex challenges that scholars repeatedly voice in our advocacy practice is publishing one’s first monograph Open Access. Although there is an increasing support from science funders to extend their Open Access mandates to books, and to cover the costs of Book Publishing Charges, first monographs typically come from PhD dissertations, not externally funded research projects. Likewise, even though some of the research institutions have transformative agreements and/or institutional Open Access funds in place, these are not always available for non-permanent (or non-tenured) faculty members and usually do not cover the whole publication charges (BPCs) of a monograph published in the book series that is topically the most relevant to Early Career Researchers (ECRs).  This gap in the Open Access funding structures is not the only difficulty ECRs are facing when they wish to publish their first monograph Open Access. A well-known and frequently voiced challenge is that due to the very strong influence of the  prestige economy on the current academic tenure and promotion criteria, in most cases, young scholars still need to choose between their academic career prospects vs. publishing in fair Open Access venues (and all the societal, economic and scholarly benefits that come with it).  Therefore, it is clear that in parallel to our ongoing efforts and commitments of different kinds to change this situation for the better and enable the full transition of scholarly communication to responsible and community-driven means of Open Access on a systemic level,  we need to provide immediate help to ECRs to enable them to start from a strong position in terms of formal assessment but also to practice their ethical devotion and establish themselves as scholars who significantly contribute  to the fair and open research culture.  The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond.  For more details about the considerations behind the call, read here. Criteria regarding the APPLICANTS:  We follow the European Research Council’s definition of ECRs: Researchers up to 7 years after PhD, including doctoral candidates who did not earn their title yet. Criteria regarding the topic of the BOOK:  Criteria regarding the VENUE and FORMAT:  Criteria regarding the ACCESS CONDITIONS:  Details of the FUNDING:  Evaluation of the submissions is proposed to happen on two levels:  Applications should be submitted at oamonograph@dariah.eu List of the documents to be submitted: Should you have any further questions, please contact DARIAH’s Open Science Officer, Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra (erzsebet.toth-czifra@dariah.eu) for more details.  In June, an information session will be organised where applicants can ask further questions in a live chat.

The digital cultural record has a powerful role to play in both new and future strategies of creating new homes within the digital milieu. For example, the development and establishment of new digital archives around South Asian studies not only allows us to create new archives of the past but also to remember and commemorate the past differently. New maps transform how we understand space and place. And new digital comfort zones facilitate connections for those whose family and loved ones are only accessible online. Such interventions are essential to the recuperation of the integrity and soul of a people who have lived through and continue to shoulder the fraught and painful legacies of the British Empire and the communal bloodshed wrought by its demise. 
Building on the important history of digital humanities scholarship in South Asia and its diasporas that precedes this work, this book contends that South Asian studies is further positioned to offer a new genealogy of digital humanities, demonstrated through this assemblage of essays that reveal how the digital continues to shape notions of home, belonging, nation, identity, memory, and diaspora through a variety of humanistic methodologies and digital techniques. 
South Asian Digital Humanities thus demonstrates that postcolonial digital humanities has great possibility for creating some of the most important social justice scholarship in South Asian studies of the past century.

This book was originally published as a special issue of South Asian Review.
 The digital cultural record has a powerful role to play in both new and future strategies of creating new homes within the digital milieu. For example, the development and establishment of new digital archives around South Asian studies not only allows us to create new archives of the past but also to remember and commemorate the past differently. New maps transform how we understand space and place. And new digital comfort zones facilitate connections for those whose family and loved ones are only accessible online. Such interventions are essential to the recuperation of the integrity and soul of a people who have lived through and continue to shoulder the fraught and painful legacies of the British Empire and the communal bloodshed wrought by its demise.  Building on the important history of digital humanities scholarship in South Asia and its diasporas that precedes this work, this book contends that South Asian studies is further positioned to offer a new genealogy of digital humanities, demonstrated through this assemblage of essays that reveal how the digital continues to shape notions of home, belonging, nation, identity, memory, and diaspora through a variety of humanistic methodologies and digital techniques.  South Asian Digital Humanities thus demonstrates that postcolonial digital humanities has great possibility for creating some of the most important social justice scholarship in South Asian studies of the past century. It offers these essays as innovative interventions that complicate the digital cultural record while lodging a 'homelanding' for South Asians within it, positioning digital humanities as a method through which South Asian studies can strategically participate in the ongoing struggle for representation within digital knowledge production.

Roopika Risam (PhD, Emory University, Atlanta, USA) is an Associate Professor of Secondary and Higher Education and English and the Faculty Fellow for Digital Library Initiatives at Salem State University, USA, where she also serves as Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Digital Studies, and Coordinator of the Combined B.A./M.Ed. in English Education. Her research interests lie at the intersections of postcolonial and African diaspora studies, humanities knowledge infrastructures, digital humanities, and new media. Her first monograph, New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy, was published by Northwestern University Press in 2018. She is co-editing two volumes: Intersectionality in Digital Humanities with Barbara Bordalejo for Arc Humanities Press and The Digital Black Atlantic with Kelly Baker Josephs for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series (University of Minnesota Press). Along with Carol Stabile, she is Co-Director of Reanimate, an intersectional feminist publishing collective recovering archival writing by women in media activism. She recently received the Massachusetts Library Association’s Civil Liberties Champion Award for her work promoting equity and justice in the digital cultural record. Roopika Risam  Rahul K. Gairola  ""Pertinent, provocative, and powerful – the contributions in South Asian Digital Humanities align and advance, engage and intervene, together documenting, situating and resituating essential foundations, rich contexts and imperative perspectives that collectively inform this important area. Risam and Gairola have produced a commendable volume that situates timely dialogues and debates of the digital humanities in the historical, theoretical, and geographical contexts of postcolonial South Asia."" - Ray Siemens, Distinguished Professor of English and Director of the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL), Implementing New Knowledge Environments Project, and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada; and Global Innovations Chair in the Digital Humanities in the PVC Office of Education and Arts at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia   ""The digital record has an increasingly important role to play in the study of South Asian texts and cultures. Gairola and Risam's timely collection is an important intervention at the nexus of humanities and digital research techniques, articulating the need for methodologies that embrace de-colonial, feminist and intersectional perspectives to understand South Asian approaches to identity, nationality, colonialism, and diaspora. Covering literature, poetry, digital archives, and data infrastructures, this formidable volume provides a roadmap for interrogating issues of diversity, equity, and representation, while providing a necessary platform for digital postcolonial studies that is inclusive of South Asian voices and cultures.""  - Melissa Terras, Professor of Digital Cultural Heritage at the University of Edinburgh's College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; Director of the Edinburgh Centre for Data, Culture and Society; and Director of Research in the Edinburgh Futures Institute, Scotland   ""How do the digital afterlives of colonialism shape the formation of the digital record, and in turn, the cultural memory of humanity? In raising these questions, the contributors to this stimulating collection stake new and important terrain for the digital humanities. This collection of essays prises open rich veins of thinking around the digital turn and its implications not only for archives, pedagogy and research, but for the reproduction of silences, inequalities and broader workings of power. In revisiting the project of postcolonialism through the lens of the digital humanities, the gift of these essays is a re-spiriting of both. A politically engaged postcolonial scholarship must now contribute to envisioning a post-surveillance society, a politics of the disconnected subject and a differently connected global community."" - Melinda Hinkson, Director of the Institute of Postcolonial Studies, Melbourne; and Convening Editor of the journal Postcolonial Studies   ""Roopika Risam and Rahul K Gairola’s South Asian Digital Humanities is an important and timely volume offering a collection of innovative chapters which explore digital humanities in the South Asian context. The contributors come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and make innovative methodological and theoretical interventions. The field-defining introduction is followed by chapters that deal with digital politics, archives, literary texts and infrastructures. As an emerging discipline, I believe this will be a key text for digital humanities in South Asia."" - Rohit K Dasgupta, Senior Lecturer in Cultural Industries, University of Glasgow; and Visiting Fellow, Loughborough University, UK   ""South Asian Digital Humanities breaks new ground by drawing together established and emerging voices to set out an ambitious agenda and key issues for contemporary comparative research at the intersection of digital humanities, postcolonial and diaspora studies. In this impressive, innovative volume, diverse strands of critical debate are interwoven with wider historical and cultural trajectories, expanding our understanding of the possibilities of digital approaches to South Asian scholarship.""   - Paul Arthur, Vice-Chancellor’s Professorial Research Fellow; and Chair in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Arts and Humanities, Edith Cowan University, Western Australia   ""This volume truly innovates valuable scholarship. Roopika Risam and Rahul Gairola have done an admirable job in producing and curating a collection of essays that constellates diverse scholarly questions and insights that explore, and expand, the boundaries of postcolonial studies and digital humanities. With nuance, breadth, and depth, this volume critically responds to the ever-growing complexity of the increasingly digital contexts in which we work, think, and live. And perhaps just as importantly, this work reveals  possibilities of what contemporary digital humanities can be, as well as the vital contributions that emerge from innovative explorations like this. South Asian Digital Humanities is a building block for much more to come."" - Tyler Shores, University of Cambridge ThinkLab Manager; and Senior Research Associate, Intellectual Forum at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, UK. ©  Informa UK Limited, an Informa Plc company

Don’t Save the University—Transform It - Public Books;"What’s next for the digital humanities? And how might they be part of changing our collective futures? As universities across the country reach the end of this unprecedented year, Public Books and Digital Humanities at MIT present a four-part series examining the role of the digital in the life of scholars and societies. In this moment of global reckoning around issues of virological, ecological, historical, and moral concern, some of the field’s top thinkers here ask how digital media and methods continue to challenge, harm, sustain, and liberate—and they show how investigations into the relationship between the digital and the human have only just begun. —Stephanie Ann Frampton “Why read and write about literature while the world burns?” This question framed the fall 2020 Introduction to Graduate Studies in Literature course I taught for the master’s in English program at Salem State University—and also framed my own despair. Dispensing with the traditional survey of theory from Plato to Derrida, I introduced students to the history of English as a discipline, the shifts augured by the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s, and the possibilities offered by public and digital humanities. Yes, we read theory—Marxist, critical race, intersectional feminist, queer, disability, postcolonial, Indigenous, and abolition—with an eye toward the ways theory can position our work in the humanities as tools of resistance. If we are to ensure the long-term future of the liberal arts, we must reframe and rethink how we teach our students about the work that the humanities can do in the world. While the humanities have been dramatically sidelined in the past, such changes are crucial to demonstrating how valuing them anew offers us ways to reimagine the university as a site of justice. For public higher education, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the effects of a long decline in public funding. For years, colleges and universities have been eking out their continued existence through austerity measures: making small, often unstrategic cuts to budgets while attempting to maintain operations under increasingly tenuous circumstances. Now, they have been confronted with the financial challenges of the pandemic. These include refunds for auxiliary services like housing and dining, the cost of remote learning, the predatory educational-technology sector rushing to provide “solutions,” the cost of cleaning and testing protocols, and declining enrollments from a student population unsure of whether to take on the financial burden of postsecondary education amid a public-health crisis and the attendant economic crisis. Having already embraced austerity, colleges and universities are helpless before the pandemic’s new challenges. Indeed, there is nothing left to cut. Three stimulus packages from Congress have staved off imminent closure for most universities. But this has far from solved the longer-term institutional challenges of the untenable funding model of privatization, coupled with demographic shifts that leave particular regions vulnerable to the “enrollment cliff,” a projected drop in the numbers of students attending college that looms by 2026 due to the precipitous decline in the US birthrate from 2008 to 2011. Continuing the austerity model—that is, managing these issues through furloughs, layoffs, and program closures—remains on the table. Meanwhile, upper administration and boards struggle to carve out a new, more sustainable model for higher education, or face closure. As happens in such situations, attention to metrics like enrollments and credit hours prompts these leaders to identify “profitable” programs through their business-intelligence or other data-driven metrics. While this is valuable data, the tendency of boards and presidents to view it piecemeal—department by department, major to major, credit hour to credit hour—puts lower-enrolled majors in a precarious position. Failing to take into account the cost of delivery of programs, the role of service departments in supporting majors with higher enrollments through general education, or the ways liberal-arts programs subsidize other areas of the university often seems to lead to a familiar conclusion: the humanities and social sciences are areas to cut. Such cuts were once a tragedy; now, they are unconscionable. We need the insights of the humanities now as much as ever. Black, brown, and Indigenous people continue to face unabated violence and brutality, aided and abetted by legal and judicial systems. The racial and ethnic disparities in health care that have always existed in the United States have been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. Centuries of inequities born from Indigenous dispossession and racial capitalism have finally started to garner attention in the public sphere. Our moment is now. People in the United States must be prepared to work toward and demand an end to the ceaseless oppressions that so many face. In this urgent work, the humanities can help. But at a time where the humanities are under threat, how do we envision this work might continue? Some rightfully decry the effects of neoliberalism on higher education and harken to an idealized notion of the purpose of the university, grounded in the liberal arts, as offering access to education for all. These discourses often fail to consider that this ideal of the university never existed in the first place. In fact, the history of higher education in the United States has been beset by a crisis of purpose from its very beginning, as noted by theorists like Thorstein Veblen and John Thelin. Disciplines as we know them today only began taking their present shape in US higher education in the early 20th century. The first universities founded in the United States were not created for all but for a class of white men who would serve as self-appointed leaders of a new nation. It is true, of course, that shifts in demographics, the expansion of public higher education through the Morrill Land-Grant Acts in the 19th century, and larger numbers of Black, brown, and Indigenous people entering predominantly white institutions starting in the late 1960s have increased educational attainment over time. Nevertheless, disparities continue to exist. Universities have not effectively grappled with their roles in systemic racism, which plays out across the university: boards, administration, faculty, staff, curriculum, student life, athletics, and partnerships with corporations and the government. Nor have they begun addressing their historical and ongoing participation in Indigenous dispossession and genocide. If the university truly wants to justify itself through the liberal arts, the university must change—and the humanities must change too. This imperative requires reframing and rethinking the work that the humanities can do in the world: humanities engaged in and deeply connected to the material realities of oppression in our communities. Public and digital humanities have redefined the role of the humanities today. Scholars working in these areas, in collaboration with communities, are convincingly making the case for the value of the humanities, whether addressing historical inequalities or those of the present day. Projects like SlaveVoyages, for example, shed light on the history of slavery, while projects like COVID Black demonstrate how the legacies of slavery and racial capitalism shape how communities are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Equally crucial public- and digital-humanities work in Latinx, Native and Indigenous, and Asian American studies tackles links between the inequalities of history and the present. From the early work of scholars like W. E. B. Du Bois forward, Black, brown, and Indigenous scholars have been the vanguard of public humanities. Indeed, they have demonstrated precisely how the humanities can promote awareness and understanding of Indigenous dispossession and racial capitalism. However, universities have failed to appropriately value and recognize this work. The outputs of public- and digital-humanities scholarship look different from the monographs and journal articles highly prized by hiring and tenure and promotion committees. This work is often interdisciplinary and does not fit neatly within the discipline-based structures of academic departments, thus adding further challenges to its evaluation—and valuation. Scholars of color and Indigenous scholars, who often pursue this work, contend with these challenges of genre and interdisciplinarity on top of the routinized racialized and colonial inequalities they experience in the contemporary academy. Thus, the very scholarship that demonstrates the value of the liberal arts is undermined by our own faculty peers, who are unwilling to consider a more expansive notion of what constitutes “scholarship.” How, then, should these public humanities be valued? More importantly, how might the university reorient itself toward such humanities for the public? This requires that faculty advocate for recognition of interdisciplinary research and scholarship that takes untraditional forms—and to create opportunities for their students to do this work. I could see glimpses of this future in my fall 2020 class. In their final projects, students applied what we had learned to their own personal and professional goals in a genre of their choice. While some chose to explore the scholarly-essay genre, the project yielded a variety of results that demonstrate the value of digital and public humanities. These included high school curricula, public-humanities projects, and grant proposals for digital-humanities projects that engaged deeply with questions of race, sexuality, and disability. Many of these students, particularly those who are in-service teachers, are currently implementing their projects and seeing the work the humanities can do in the world. In the students’ final reflections on the course, the dominant theme was one of possibility—through the course they had learned that the possibilities of the humanities extend beyond academic audiences alone and are vitally connected to the most pressing social issues of our day. If we can communicate that sense of possibility in the humanities—to our students, to broader publics—and if we can make this work sustainable for the faculty who pursue it, we can begin addressing some of the racial disparities of workload within the academy and create new audiences for the humanities. The future of the university—and of the world—depend on it.   This article was commissioned by Stephanie Ann Frampton and Carolyn Dever.  Subscribe to RSS Keep Updated:";https://buff.ly/3ub55HS;
Robert Hollander, preeminent scholar of Dante, ‘pioneer’ of the digital humanities and Princeton alumnus, dies at 87;"Robert Hollander, professor of European literature, and French and Italian, emeritus, and renowned scholar of Dante, died peacefully of natural causes at his family’s home in Pau'uilo, Hawaii on April 20. He was 87. Robert Hollander Hollander joined Princeton’s faculty in 1962 and transferred to emeritus status in 2003. His teaching and research centered on medieval Italian literature, with a focus on the work of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio.  “Professor Hollander was a central figure in the Department of French and Italian for 40 years,” said Tom Trezise, professor of French and Italian and department chair. “His substantial publications and related professional activity ensured a very prominent place for Princeton on the international map of Dante scholarship, and he was a pioneer in the creation of digital resources for the study of literature.” Trezise continued: “As a committed teacher of the humanities, Hollander touched the lives of countless Princeton undergraduates; as a dedicated graduate advisor and colleague, he helped to promote and enrich the careers of a great many fellow humanists. His passing marks an inestimable loss for the department and the University.” From 1975-98, Hollander was also a member of the Department of Comparative Literature, where he served as chair from 1994-98 and as director of undergraduate studies from 1975-78. He was also head of Butler College, one of Princeton’s six residential colleges, from 1991-95. Hollander’s efforts to improve the food options at Butler, starting with French bread and crisp apples, influenced Campus Dining offerings at all the residential colleges.  In 1986, he was awarded the University’s Howard T. Behrman Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Humanities. He was honored by the Alumni Council in 2007 with an Award for Service to Princeton. Over the course of his career, Hollander wrote or translated 25 books. He collaborated with his wife Jean Hollander, a poet who also taught literature and writing at Princeton, Brooklyn College, Columbia University and The College of New Jersey, to translate all three sections of Dante’s masterpiece to much acclaim. In 2008, they were honored with a Gold Florin award by the city of Florence, Italy, for their translation of “The Divine Comedy.” Born in Manhattan on July 31, 1933, Hollander received his bachelor of arts in French and English from Princeton in 1955. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1962. “I met Bob in 1960, when he bussed down from Columbia to precept in my literature course on European writers,” said Albert Sonnenfeld, a 1958 Princeton graduate alumnus in modern languages and literature, and a professor of French at the University from 1958-86. “He was an old Tiger, and so happy to return to his alma mater. He soon spotted the ‘spotty’ Italian program, and in one of those intense and admirable acts of sheer willpower Bob secretly vowed to master Italian and become the Dante specialist so lacking in our ranks.” Sonnenfeld added: “He worked so hard to achieve this goal and succeeded beyond anyone's imagining. His Dante course developed its own alumni, who at each Princeton Reunions would work up a canto or two for learned discussion.” Hollander’s Dante course at Princeton, affectionately referred to as “the organic chemistry of the humanities,” enjoyed a robust following from students and alumni. The dedication plaque inside room 111 in East Pyne Hall — home to many of Princeton’s language departments — reads, “Here, Professor Robert Hollander ’55 taught the Divine Comedy for 35 years: Generations of devoted students were inspired by his teaching.” Every year at Reunions, alumni of Hollander’s famed course gather in East Pyne to read from Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” a tradition that began in 1977 and has continued annually for more than four decades. For many years, Hollander took a group of Dante alumni to an 11th-century castle in Certaldo, Italy, to study Dante’s Inferno “in situ,” a memorable experience for all.  At Princeton, Hollander’s teaching and mentorship inspired undergraduate and graduate students, some of whom became lifelong friends and colleagues. “In the first conversation I ever had with Bob, my new sophomore adviser, I confessed to him that I was afraid I would never be able to write well,” said Frank Ordiway, a member of the Class of 1981 and a 1990 graduate alumnus in the comparative literature. “His simple response was, ‘Of course you will. I'll teach you.’ I remember feeling immensely grateful that he took my anxiety seriously, but I didn’t at that time grasp what he really meant when he went on to add something to the effect that it would be easier to write well if I actually knew something that was worth writing about and that maybe I should try a little Dante.” Ordiway, a former assistant professor and a former associate dean at Princeton, continued: “Years later, after having been his advisee for sophomore, junior and senior years and for my Ph.D. dissertation, I realize that I am still haunted and governed by that short, first conversation that was so quintessentially Bob and his philosophy: listen to your students and take them seriously, try to know and understand something before having an opinion about it, and you might as well start with Dante.” “It is difficult for me to think of one thing that Bob did or meant for me as a teacher and reader of medieval literature,” said Simone Marchesi, associate professor of French and Italian and a 2002 graduate alumnus. “He taught me so much of what I know about Dante and Boccaccio and shaped through his example so much of what I do every day.” Marchesi continued: “Perhaps the single most inspiring element in our relationship was the opportunity he gave me to witness as a graduate student and eventually as preceptor his unflinching devotion to undergraduate teaching, a teaching which combined absolute scholarly rigor with an unmatched openness to take everybody's contribution into serious consideration.” Outside of Princeton, Hollander’s impact on the field of Italian medieval literature and its scholars reached nationally and internationally, but in particular at Dartmouth College, where he taught as a visiting professor and established a digital Dante-focused humanities project before digital humanities existed. Hollander wondered how scholarly output could change if one could access all the Dante commentaries on a personal computer, an innovative idea in a time when very few humanistic disciplines had even begun to explore how computing could meet scholarly needs. With the help of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Hollander’s pilot program grew into the prestigious international Dartmouth Dante Project, a digital archive collecting scores of commentaries on the “Commedia.” Hollander also was the founding director for the Princeton Dante Project, which featured an annotated virtual edition of “The Divine Comedy,” and the Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America, an online journal for Dante scholars. Hollander received numerous awards including grants from Fulbright, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the NEH. He served as president of the Dante Society of America from 1979-85, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.  Donations may be made to the Professor Robert Hollander ’55 and Jean Hollander Scholarship fund.

Black Lives Matter Murals;"Black Lives Matter Murals Downtown Raleigh, NC  The following images are of murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, crafted by various artists, creators, and makers on brick and plywood. While made of various materials with different styles, these pieces of community-generated art all illustrate and amplify the important message that Black Lives Matter. Here, Slow looking is coupled with the murals to equip us with the opportunity to experience greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.  Slow looking with BLM Murals Slow looking was developed by Cogapp Labs - where they identify that the application is “A relaxing full-screen immersive experience.""

        Cogapp further expresses:
        
        “This relaxing full-screen immersive experience will slowly show your chosen image in detail. It takes a few rejuvenating minutes to complete, best enjoyed without distractions.”
        
        But how can Slow looking give us an opportunity to sit with images and art that was created with temporary materials with messages that carry a long and painful history and remind us how that history and socio-political inequalities are still present and dangerous today?
        
        The following images are from various artists, creators, and makers and their murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The Slow looking experience equips us with a greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.
        
        As Cogapp suggests, view and experience these images without distractions. But instead of passively observing this immersive experience, pay attention to what you are seeing, thinking, and feeling. How do these images surprise, shock, challenge, ignite you?

Hacking the Humanities | The New Yorker;"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Elias Muhanna Last spring, I taught a literature seminar called “Before Wikipedia.” The subject was the history of encyclopedic writing, from ancient times to the present day. We read excerpts of Isidore of Seville’s ""Etymologies"" and Diderot’s ""Encyclopédie"" alongside works by Calvino, Sebald, and Flaubert. The word “Wikipedia” in the course title seemed to attract an unusual preponderance of science majors for a seminar in comparative literature. There were physicists and mathematicians, a cluster of coders, an engineer, a neuroscience major. I teach at Brown, which has an open curriculum that encourages diverse course enrollments, but I’d never found myself in a room with so many young scientists patiently waiting for me to begin a lecture that I wasn’t planning to give. In my experience, a successful seminar usually involves a mutiny quite early in the semester, when the students take over and my own voice is drowned out by the din of a crowded wheelhouse. This particular seminar’s discussions, however, began awkwardly. The silences I’ve learned to let hang in a classroom seemed unreasonably long. In the first week, I was further unnerved by an odd sound each time I’d turn to write something on the blackboard—the fluent skittering of fingers across twenty laptop keyboards, transcribing my scrawled words as though they’d be on an exam later in the week. Our first writing assignment was on the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder, whose ""Natural History"" is a font of Late Antiquity information on a stupefying range of subjects: the history of paper, portents provided by bees, the manufacture of purple dye, Alexander the Great’s famous dog. I asked the students to study Pliny’s writing style and try to mimic it in their own entry about a topic not treated in ""The Natural History_.""_ A week later, I had a stack of finely rendered facsimiles of Pliny’s clipped prose, on such topics as “coffee and coffee shops,” “the usual and unusual attributes of the hype man,” Chick-fil-A, and Kanye West. As I read through pages of perfect mimicry and snarky pastiche, I felt relief. The “two cultures” of the sciences and humanities were not so far apart, after all, or at least could be bridged by the lingua franca of pop culture. One student, Henry, a double major in computer science and mathematics, approached the assignment differently. Rather than trying to imitate Pliny himself, he found a text version of ""The Natural History"" on the Internet, analyzed its thirty-seven books using a natural-language processing toolkit, and then wrote a computer algorithm that generated English sentences using the discovered features of Pliny’s style. Here’s a sample from the passage that he submitted: The Pharusi, originally a Persian people, are said to be very greatly infested by pirates. And it will not be doubted that one or other of two things, full moon or the moon's conjunction in summer she must retire a long way off, and is gathered by the daughters of Hesperus. Ctesias states that in India there is a fish called the platanista with a dolphin's beak and tail, but 24 ft. long. Also great creatures resembling sheep come out on to the land for an unascertained reason, and they bud best under those circumstances, as otherwise it would make only leaves. Even so it is dragged ashore by more men hauling from the beach. Henry turned in the assignment even though the algorithm had failed to produce “any sophisticated themes or totally coherent sentences,” as he put it. His robot encyclopedist spoke in magnetic poetry phrases, which occasionally yielded uncanny reproductions of Plinian syntax but often fell flat. Optimizing the program by using something called Latent Semantic Analysis and something else called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo could be interesting, he mused, but would require more time than he was willing to devote to the project at the moment. After reading the assignment and reëvaluating the choices I’d made in my life, I slowly wrote the letter A in my grade book next to Henry’s name. My own programming skills were somewhat rudimentary and, without his cheerful explanations of the code, I would have been lost. There were two things, though, of which I was certain. First, a machine guided by an undergraduate had taught me something new about the expository style of an ancient Roman natural historian. Second, I had to hire Henry. During the previous months, I’d been learning a coding language while trying to develop a project about the aesthetics of classical Arabic poetry. My interests were similar to Henry’s: What could we learn about an author’s oeuvre by studying his or her tics and favorite clichés? What made a certain poem identifiably the product of a person, place, or time, from the perspective of syntax and vocabulary? After class one day, I asked Henry whether he would be interested in collaborating, though I felt sure that he had more interesting things to do with his time. Amazingly, he agreed. We spent the rest of the semester developing an algorithm that could detect different types of rhetorical figures in a large corpus of poetry. It flew through thousands of lines of verse like a drone over a wildlife habitat, snapping pictures of similes, allusions, and metatheses. The program, like the Pliny text generator, produced both epiphanies and duds. We spent a lot of time hand-checking the results, cleaning the data, tweaking a variable and rerunning the code. There were many crash courses on unfamiliar topics. I explained the basic principles of Arabic morphology and classical poetics to Henry, which he internalized effortlessly. Meanwhile, he explained terms like Hellinger distance, quadratic time, and high-dimensional space to me, while I blinked vacantly and asked him to repeat it all just one more time. By the end of the term, my hard drive was littered with raw text files, Python scripts, and data visualizations. I spent as much time scrolling through the pages of Stack Overflow—an online discussion forum frequented by coders and engineers—as I did sorting through the poems in our corpus. Every little victory was accompanied by two or three major setbacks. It was exhilarating. In the past decade, digital scholarship has gone from being a quirky corner of the humanities to a mainstream phenomenon, restructuring funding landscapes and pushing tenure committees to develop new protocols for accrediting digital projects. As the stakes have grown, so has an expectation about the role that the “digital turn” might play in revivifying the humanities, effecting a synthesis with the sciences, and other weighty causes. For many of its champions, the tinkering character of the digital humanities represents a kind of artisanal inquisitiveness, a hands-on, tool-building, map-making ethos that chafes against more abstract modes of humanistic inquiry. Our poetry project had less modest ambitions. Still, over the course of stitching together our digital monster, I found myself thinking about the future. Would my graduate students soon have to pass comprehensive exams in JavaScript and QGIS alongside classical Arabic? Would the trickling stream of humanities jobs become a swift-moving river, swollen with funding and public-private synergies? Every sunlit vision casts a dystopic shadow. On occasion, I’d bring up these issues with Henry, but he seemed puzzled by them. Our collaboration didn’t need to offer a panacea for the humanities to be worthwhile; it just needed to solve a problem. I could hear the silence hanging in the classroom again, aware that the undergraduate with his skittering laptop keyboard was now doing the talking, while I was the one grasping for answers.

Historian to bring more digital expertise to the digital humanities | Colorado Arts and Sciences Magazine | University of Colorado Boulder;"
 CU Boulder scholar is one of the newest recipients of the prestigious Mellon New Directions fellowship, which promotes continued interdisciplinary training Research can sometimes take scholars in unexpected directions, making certain lines of inquiry difficult to pursue—but not impossible, at least with more training. A prestigious fellowship recently awarded to a University of Colorado Boulder professor, though, allows for just that. Henry Lovejoy, an assistant professor of history, is the first scholar from CU Boulder to receive the Mellon New Directions Fellowship, an award from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that encourages professors in the humanities and humanistic social sciences to pursue additional necessary training outside their field of study, taking their research in new directions.    At the top of the page: Map of the precolonial African coast, 1828. Above: a combined visualization of 1828.   For Lovejoy, a historian who studies the African diaspora and has been working to map precolonial Africa, this $268,000 award will allow him not just to study the historical records and datasets of the Yoruba diaspora, but also to learn and understand the mathematical and spatial statistical models behind mapping.  Up to this point, Lovejoy relied on the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA) at CU Boulder and graduate students Vachan Daffedar Aswathanarayana (MCompSci’20), Zachary Mullen (PhDApMath’20), Ashton Wiens (MApMath’20), as well as Tiffany Beebe, Alexander Langer, Travis May and Megan Tocci, graduate students in history, to generate the data, develop new digital methods, perform analyses and unveil never before seen maps of part of precolonial Africa. With this fellowship, though, he’ll gain the technical skills necessary to do some of this work himself, including completing a GIS and Computational Learning certificate at CU Boulder; learn some spatial statistical modelling in consultation with Eric Vance, an associate professor of applied math at CU Boulder and LISA’s director; and continue working with a Canadian digital humanities company, Walk With Web, owned by Kartikay Chadha.  Ultimately, he plans to use these experiences to create a mapping-based interactive digital archive that will be freely available to the general public, potentially helping millions across North America, the Caribbean and Latin America gain a deeper understanding of African ancestry. We recently talked with Lovejoy about this award, what he plans to do with it, and the significance of interdisciplinary research: Q: “Congratulations on winning this award! What was your reaction when you found out that you won?” A: “I’m really excited because it’s a huge project to undertake and I think this is going to be really an interesting way to look at the African diaspora. I’m trying to map different points of conflict over time in precolonial Africa and line it up with slave trade data to understand the probabilities of African origins. So I think the impact of this fellowship is huge in terms of Africa ancestry in Africa and across the Americas, not just in the United States, but also in the Caribbean and Brazil and other places in Latin America. It brings a unique set of skills to be able to map uncertain geographies so that we can begin to plot the changes to different places alongside the movement of people.    The digital humanities are really on the cusp of a major breakthrough, and visualizations are really key to educating not only other researchers, students, but the general public.""  This project is endless in scope, but it will provide opportunities to develop new lines of research and recruit a diverse student body, who can help participate in such a massive endeavor.” Q: “In the proposal you mentioned creating an innovative, digital archive. So, how do you envision that looking or what are you envisioning including as part of that?” A: “What I’m envisioning is creating an animated map that shifts over time. So, every year we have numbers of slave ships departing the coast, and then internally there are different conflicts that happened over time. The hypothesis is that a large amount of people were enslaved during intra-African conflict and then were subsequently taken to the coast. By doing this, I will be connecting and layering spatial data into other open source archival information and datasets such as those related to slave voyages, or historical narratives of enslaved experiences over space and time. There is so much spatial data yet to be mined from primary and secondary sources. I believe that with these new skills, it will be possible to map a part of our planet in a historical period that has yet to be truly visualized. … Up until this point, it’s been really difficult because we haven’t really been able to put people, specific people, where they came from inland onto particular slave ships. Now, internally for Africa, it’s a lot more complicated, but there are more archaeological discoveries, so I think 3D technologies are going become really important, so you have a data point inland and begin to look at archaeological sites or connecting multimedia such as oral traditions and other interviews of people, local leaders and such who are talking about the history. Currently, archeologists are 3D scanning world heritage sites, so it will also be possible to take students to these difficult-to-reach places in Africa via virtual, mixed or augmented educational environments linked into a cartographic archive.      Henry Lovejoy   Alternatively, we can begin to reverse engineer all of this spatial data as well and begin to look at internal migrations within Africa, so there’s actually a very huge slave trade that went into a number of states that were forming in this period, and those slave populations were as much as the Americas combined. So, we actually have a lot of missing information about the lives of millions upon millions of people whose voices have been silenced through racism and discrimination.” Q: “Broadly speaking, what do you view as the significance of studying or adding this interdisciplinary education to what you already know?” A: “I think right now, the digital humanities are really on the cusp of a major breakthrough, and visualizations are really key to educating not only other researchers, students, but the general public.  Understanding maps is a really good way to help people locate themselves within their very complicated history. We tend not to think about Africa in the precolonial period. We look at the modern-day boundaries, but those are really only relatively recent since post-World War II. So you go back another 50 years, and that’s when the colonial map happened.  I’m working in the period where there are basically no maps that exist due to lack of written evidence among cultures that chose different ways to transmit their histories. So people often have a misconception that they might come from a place like Ghana or Angola, but those countries didn’t exist until the mid-20th century following decolonization. I think bringing in different types of visualizations to arts and humanities research is only going to be more and more important.”      Subscribe  Request Info  Give 275 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309

Why You Should Get a Master's in Digital Humanities;Back to News Home We have dozens of flexible accelerated and graduate degrees available for adults — online, in-person or at one of our Wisconsin regional centers. Fill out this form to get more information. Do you have a story idea or media inquiry for Concordia’s Strategic Communications team? Send an email to news@cuw.edu. Digital Humanities is a rapidly growing field that blends life-long learning with the development of 21st century technological skills required for the global job market.  PC Mag referred to Digital Humanities as “the most exciting field you’ve never heard of” in a post back in 2017. If it’s so exciting, why haven’t we heard of it? Probably because the digital humanities are happening all around us.  Dr. Erin Laverick, Concordia University’s Digital Humanities Program Director, explains the emerging field this way: “The digital humanities prepares students not only in honing their content knowledge of a particular field such as history, theology, philosophy, English, and more, it also teaches them how to use and design digital tools in order to research and explore ethical, social, and religious issues relevant to local and global communities.” Dr. Laverick continues: “You may be a history major and love spending your time in the digital archives, looking through sites such as the Library of Congress. Have you ever considered who built that site that you use so often? People with knowledge of history and digital archival design all played a role in building the Library of Congress digital archive.” The advent of social media and smartphones, not to mention countless other digital advances, means that more humanities content is available to us than ever before. Studying the Digital Humanities prepares you to work in an integrated environment. In the information age, much of the work is in spaces where there is a need to develop strong content that is also data-driven. Debates in the Digital Humanities quotes Kathie Gossett from Old Dominion University, who asserts that the Digital Humanities need to be interdisciplinary. Digital Humanities breaks down barriers between local content areas, like English and history, and global areas, like humanities and computer science. In almost every field, understanding your user, your customer, or your intended audience is essential. As our world becomes more global and we communicate with more and more people, the ability to use multiple modalities in order to communicate is increasingly necessary. Dr. Laverick adds, “What excites me about the digital humanities is this field of study focuses entirely researching and digitizing to communicate with an audience.  The opportunities for exploration are endless and much needed in the job market and academy.” Students who study Digital Humanities at Concordia University take the classes 100% online. This program is 30 credits, and the courses are offered in 8-week blocks. One major benefit to the way this program is set up is that these classes are offered asynchronously, which means that you can take them at your own pace, with required check-in meetings.  You’ll be collaborating on projects with professors and coworkers throughout your time in this program. Some of these projects include using and creating digital tools, interacting with and creating digital texts, and conducting research. Dr. Laverick highlights in her webinar that you don’t need to be an expert computer scientist to develop an app as a part of an interdisciplinary team. On the other hand, if you like to code, you don’t need to be an expert in literary criticism to collaborate effectively with your colleagues. As you near the end of your program, you can choose between a practicum or a traditional thesis for your capstone project. Earning a Master's in Digital Humanities prepares you for work where the arts and sciences, the old and the new, intersect. The career paths are endless when you study Digital Humanities. Some possible options are museum curator, archival researcher, web and software design, digital pedagogical design, art and media specialist, grant writer, and more.  Steve Jobs once said of the software industry, “A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”  Those who have studied humanities know the value of engaging with different perspectives, analyzing culture, and studying language. Earning a Master’s in Digital Humanities from Concordia University will challenge your critical thinking as you prepare for a vocation of interdisciplinary collaboration in your community. —  If this story has inspired you, why not explore how you can help further Concordia's mission through giving.;https://blog.cuw.edu/what-study-digital-humanities-2163/;

Coinage of the Roman Republic Online;"Coinage of the Roman Republic Online (CRRO) aims to provide in effect an online version of Michael Crawford's 1974 publication Roman Republican Coinage (RRC), which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types. Since its publication in 1974 there have been significant revisions to the dating of the series following the discovery of new hoards, but no attempt has been made to reflect these or make any other amendments to the published typology at this stage. The descriptions for these coins are based on the typology set out in RRC, but have been modified to meet the standards of the British Museum’s collection management system. Additional types not in the British Museum’s collection were added to this database by Richard Witschonke of the ANS. This project takes as its starting point the Roman Republican coins in the British Museum collection. These are published in a dedicated online catalogue prepared in 2010

We would like to acknowledge the contribution of Michael Crawford to the project and also to thank Michael Sharp of Cambridge University Press for allowing us to use the numbering system of Roman Republican Coinage. 
RRC Online is made possible by stable numismatic identifiers and linked open data methodologies established by the Nomisma.org project. Coin type data are made available with an Open Database License. All images are copyright of their respective institutions. In November 2020, CRRO is beginning to enter a second phase of advanced functionality, integrating die links established by Richard Schaefer in the Roman Republican Die Project. Where applicable, the pages for RRC numbers have been enhanced by displaying die
    links in tables and network graphs, with the die pairings and numeric counts of specimens downloadable as CSV files for further analysis in other
    statistical platforms. New specimens from private collections and auction catalogs are being made available in CRRO through the ANS' SITNAM database. Eventually, this will enhance the coverage in CRRO to some 300,000 Roman Republican coins.

Play with Virtual Movable Books | Learning as Play;"This site allows users to “play” with virtual reproductions of rare items that are too fragile to allow frequent use of the originals. The items are represented as interactive lift-the-flap books that can be manipulated in the same manner as the originals. Metamorphic pictures are made on a long sheet of paper that is folded twice horizontally so that the top and bottom meet in the middle and create two flaps, and then folded and cut vertically to create a number of panels. Lifting the top flap and then lowering the bottom flap creates three different scenes for each panel. *The Virtual Movable Books site requires the use of the Unity Web Player.

Research institute aims to bring diverse ‘new storytellers’ to digital scholarship | Nebraska Today | University of Nebraska–Lincoln;"May 21, 2021        ·
      5 min read     The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is preparing to welcome 23 emerging scholars from minority-serving institutions for an intensive, interdisciplinary institute that will explore the platforms, tools, designs and ethical questions surrounding digital humanities projects in ethnic studies. “New Storytellers: The Research Institute in Digital Ethnic Studies” will begin May 24 and be held virtually over 10 weeks. It is one of the only digital humanities research institutes in the United States focused on digital research in ethnic studies. It was made possible by grant funding from the American Council of Learned Societies and support from the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and the Institute for Ethnic Studies. 






          Huettl    


“New Storytellers” was organized by a team of scholars at Nebraska committed to bringing new voices and diverse stories and projects into the digital humanities sphere. Leading the effort are co-principal investigators Joy Castro, Willa Cather Professor of English and ethnic studies and director of the Institute for Ethnic Studies; Margaret Huettl, assistant professor of history and ethnic studies; Jeannette Eileen Jones, associate professor of history and ethnic studies; Ken Price, Hillegass University Professor of American Literature and co-director of the CDRH; and Will Thomas, Angle Chair in the Humanities, professor of history and associate dean for research and graduate education in the College of Arts and Sciences. 






          Thomas    


“We want to have an open and mutual and developmental exchange at the national level, to raise the visibility of digital humanities in ethnic studies,” Thomas said. “In the digital space, we have a lot of work to do to bring out these new stories.” The co-principal investigators are being assisted by Claire Jimenez, doctoral student in the Department of English with a graduate specialization in ethnic studies and a graduate certificate in digital humanities. In addition, CDRH staff are contributing to the institute, including Karin Dalziel, digital development manager and designer; Laura Weakly, metadata encoding specialist; Brett Barney, research associate professor; Kaci Nash, research associate; Greg Tunink, programmer/analyst; and Sarita Garcia, junior developer. 






          Price    


The 23 fellows, selected through a competitive application process, will attend sessions led by digital humanities scholars from across the United States. The fellows identified a digital humanities project in their application, and the institute’s goal is to help the scholars develop these projects through a variety of session topics. “We have people at different stages in the evolution of their projects. For some, it’s an idea that has just started, and for others, they’re in process,” Price said. “Through the institute, they’re going to be exposed to the big-picture plenary addresses, down to the very specific technical advice.” 






          Jones    


A key component of the institute is growing an intellectual community. There are networking sessions included in the syllabus and an opportunity for peer-to-peer mentoring. “We are trying to foster and create relationships,” Jones said. “If we cultivate those relationships now, they may — maybe not right away, but down the road — become collaborators and have a professional community to lean on.” Preparation and planning for the institute has been ongoing since 2017, when the co-principal investigators began visiting eight minority-serving institutions across the country — historically black colleges and universities, Native-serving institutions and Hispanic-serving institutions — to gather information about what faculty wanted and needed in terms of digital humanities. In 2018, the CDRH held its annual forum on the topic of “New Storytellers,” with many of the faculty members from minority-serving institutions in attendance. Following the forum, the Nebraska team planned a two-week, in-person institute for 2020, which was postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Institute leaders reworked the schedule into a 10-week course for 2021 and invited back the fellows originally selected. All were able to attend. The change to a virtual format, and a longer calendar schedule, allowed for some extra guest presenters to be added, including editors of scholarly journals and program officers from funding organizations, including the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. 






          Castro    


Castro said there is a pedagogical advantage to a longer format, as well. “If you’re thinking about a project in a focused way for 10 weeks, even if it’s not all day, it is still at the forefront of your mind,” she said. “As you continue to develop the project, you’re going to have questions arise that might not have come up in a hyper-concentrated two-week schedule. You have more time to think it through, build on it and test things out.” The 10-week period also will give scholars a long runway to get new projects off the ground. “It gives the participants time to embed their project in their home institution, and if they run into a technical problem or some questions, then they have time to come back to us, talk to us about it and then return home and tackle it one more time,” Price said.

 Fellows will receive ongoing mentoring from the institute’s organizing team, as well as technical assistance when needed from CDRH. The team plans to make the institute an annual offering and is seeking continued funding. “We would like to see this independently funded and permanent,” Castro said. “Based on the demand we saw when people applied, this could run every year, and this is a dynamic field that is only growing.” Thomas added: “Holding this institute at the University of Nebraska is putting it in the lead of digital humanities programs and centers around the country and around the world. We want to maintain that lead and sustain this project, as well as put it into a larger framework for race and ethnic studies inquiry, research, scholarship and publication at the university.” Some parts of this site work best with JavaScript enabled.";https://bit.ly/342fiLZ;

U of T Mississauga researcher leads new Critical Digital Humanities Initiative;UTM  Imagine being able to listen to Kimberly Nixon describe, in her own words, being turned away as a volunteer at a Vancouver rape crisis centre because of her status as a trans woman. Or having an app to report on corporate pollution near and on Indigenous lands in Canada’s North.  The University of Toronto’s Elspeth Brown says these are just two examples of how critical digital humanities research that focuses on questions of power and inequality can have a big impact. Brown, a professor in U of T Mississauga’s department of historical studies, was recently awarded $3 million in funding for the next three years to make the university a global leader in this area. “It’s about building a network of faculty members who do critical digital humanities at U of T,” says Brown, who is director of the new Critical Digital Humanities Initiative (CDHI). Brown, who is also director of the university’s Digital Humanities Network, led the tri-campus initiative that will bridge the humanities with digital technology tools, with a particular focus on anti-racist, feminist, queer and de-colonial scholarship and researchers.  Brown describes digital humanities as an interdisciplinary field that bridges the humanities and computational or digital studies. “We define the digital humanities broadly to include all the communities and methods, tools and platform-based approaches often associated with digital humanities, such as archiving, digitizing, curation, analysis, coding, editing, visualization, mapping, modelling, versioning and prototyping,” she says. “We have an inclusive agenda that encompasses interpretive or theoretical work on digitality.” Brown says she saw a need to support this area of research at the university when she started putting together the initiative’s proposal. “Once we started to really get down to the nitty gritty, we realized that actually most people doing digital humanities at U of T are doing this version of critical digital humanities that is collaborative – often public-facing – that addresses questions and social inequality and power,” Brown says. Over a 15-month period between 2019 and 2020, Brown met with researchers, chairs, and deans across the three campuses to generate support for the initiative. She also met with digital humanities faculty researchers across campus to find out what they needed and wanted for support. “I would meet with them as a team and try to ask questions like, ‘What do you need to help support your research? What are the kinds of things that you wish we had in place that would enable you to reach your goals?’”  Brown says the initiative will make an impact on humanities research, and academia in general, because it opens the door to team-based research. “That’s a very different way for scholars to work,” she says. “For these kinds of projects, you are required to (work as a team) because no one person has all the expertise and knowledge.” She says that the initiative also highlights the importance of public engagement in research. “(It’s) breaking down the barriers between the universities and outside communities, and working collaboratively with researchers, community partners, and communicating with the broader public.” In addition, she says CDHI will support research projects that are part of a broader movement to reach the public –  an audience that a peer-reviewed journal might not necessarily reach. Brown’s own LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory, which makes LGBTQ+ oral histories more accessible online, is having an impact on young people in the LGBTQ+ community. “I definitely think this kind of work has a major impact on people's capacity for resiliency in the present, and to engage with other people – who are in this case queer and trans,” says Brown. “But it's also true for many of the other projects that we're supporting through critical digital humanities.” Caleb Wellum, program officer for the initiative, says that the research supported by the CDHI will help graduate students in the digital humanities learn hands-on skills that will be needed in the job market. “One of my hopes is that it will encourage a rethinking or modernization of graduate student training in the humanities at U of T,” he says. The initiative has been funded by U of T’s Institutional Strategic Initiatives portfolio and included contributions from U of T Mississauga, U of T Scarborough, the Faculty of Information and the Faculty of Arts & Science.   Share this page  Get faculty and staff news delivered straight to your inbox.

AO3 – The mad woman in the open source attic? | Open World;"Earlier in April when I was preparing my keynote for the FLOSS UK Conference, which focused partially on issues of structural discrimination and lack of equality and diversity in open knowledge and open source communities, it struck me rather forcefully that there is one hugely successful OSS initiative supported by an almost entirely female developer and user community that rarely, if ever, gets spoken about in open knowledge and tech circles. That initiative is Archive Of Our Own. Hands up who’s heard of it? I suspect many of you won’t have heard of it. I know a few of you will have. I bet one or two of you won’t admit it. So why the reticence?  Run by the not for profit Organisation for Transformative Works, the Archive is a massively successful project that has been sustained by a hugely diverse community of volunteers for almost ten years now. It’s about as open as anything could possibly be. Why are we not singing its praises from the rafters? Why is AO3, as it’s commonly known, the mad woman in the open source attic? Some of us know it’s there, but no one really wants to talk about it. The reason for this reticence, is also the reason for the Archive’s success. AO3 is a repository of transformative works, otherwise known as fanfiction. I’m not going to debate the validity of fan works as a creative endeavour here, there is plenty of scholarly discussion on that point in other disciplines such as sociology and media, however I really do want to talk about why we don’t acknowledge AO3 as a hugely successful open project founded on the principals of equality, inclusion and diversity. Why aren’t we celebrating it and learning from it? The success of AO3 is nothing short of staggering. Built on the Ruby on Rails framework, the archive is an open source platform developed, built and maintained by an army of volunteers, the vast majority of whom are women. The project is funded by subscriptions and donations; there is no foundation funding, no sponsorship, no advertising revenue. Indeed AO3 was originally created as a haven to protect fanworks from being monetized by unscrupulous commercial ventures who sought to turn fan labour into profit for their own gain. The Archive itself now has one and a half million users and hosts around four million individual works. It’s free and open to everyone, all user accounts are pseudonymous, and at no point are users required to reveal personally identifying information. In order to manage those four million works AO3 maintains probably the only large scale community generated tagging system that I’ve ever seen working in practice. And it’s all made possible by a large community of tag wranglers who manage the free text tags provided by users. And as if all that wasn’t enough, the Organisation for Transformative works also publishes a peer reviewed open journal, Transformative Works and Cultures, maintains the Fanlore wiki to preserve the history of transformative works, it provides voluntary legal advice to creators to protect their works from legal challenge, and it has an active project, Open Doors, to absorb and curate other fan archives elsewhere on the web that are threatened by obscurity, obsolescence or deletion. It’s an astonishing achievement, but it’s an achievement that many passionate open advocates know nothing about, and, if I’m being honest, that is something that’s pissed me off enormously for years. So I was absolutely over the moon when I spoke to Claire Knowles, Library Digital Development Manager at the University of Edinburgh, at the recent Digital Day of Ideas (always a thought provoking event that pushes the boundaries) and she told me that Casey Fiesler, a member of OTW’s legal committee, would be presenting the opening keynote at this year’s Open Repositories Conference in Bozeman, Montana. Earlier this week I listened to Casey’s keynote through the conference livestream and was blown away by her talk.  Casey did an amazing job of communicating just what an important achievement AO3 is and how we can learn from its success. Giving an overview of the history and development of the Archive, Casey pointed out that AO3 is an example of amazing design, created for a community that already existed. The open software was designed and built entirely by women, which is remarkable given the small number of women in the open source community. And she concluded her keynote by asking Is there something here that’s the key to making open source more welcoming to women? I don’t know. What I do know is that if you love something enough you can build your own thing and make it work. AO3 is a great example of a successful open repository but it’s an even better example of the power of community and everything that can come out of it. The recording of Casey’s keynote isn’t online yet, though I’m sure it will be soon, but in the meantime, I’ve captured my live tweets from her keynote here; Growing Their Own: Building an Archive and a Community for Fanfiction. Many thanks to Casey for her amazing keynote and to the Open Repositories Conference Committee for inviting such an inspiring speaker. Pingback: The Archive of Our Own is now a Hugo nominee.

Domains21: Michigan State University Enmeshed in the Cloud | bavatuesdays;"I’ll be posting sessions from Domains 21 over the next several weeks as a way to keep OERxDomains21 as close to my blog heart as possible, you’ve been warmed and warned! 🙂 In this session Kathleen Fitzpatrick and Scott Schopieray discuss the ways in which the MESH Research Center at Michigan State University has been using Reclaim Cloud as a sandbox for a wide-variety of applications that will not run in cPanel cleanly. With the ability to quickly stand-up applications like Mattermost, Etherpad, Jitsi, and Discourse, the Cloud might be understood as the requisite hosting environment for a whole new class of next generation applications built in Java, Node.js, Ruby, Go, and, as is increasingly the case, packaged up as a one- Docker instance.  In addition, this session frames the importance of universities and colleges reclaiming control of their infrastructure as a means to not only explore the edges, but to ensure a degree of data sovereignty for the broader community. As with several other sessions in the Domains21 track, there is a growing sense urgency around exploring open source tools for a degree of platform independence for the broader academic discourse to remain viable.

An overview of recent digital humanities initiatives in US art libraries | Art Libraries Journal | Cambridge Core;"We use  to distinguish you from other users and to provide you with a better experience on our websites. Close this message to accept  or find out how to manage your cookie settings. 
Published online by Cambridge University Press: 
22 April 2021 As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities in a broad sense. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archive collections to support digital pedagogy. Related activities of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA), its Digital Humanities SIG and the ARLIS/NA in the Humanities Commons are also discussed.  As producers and mediators of digital resources, art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities (DH) in a broad sense. New art information professionals are expected to conversant with digital humanities.Footnote 1 A proliferation of digital projects created by art and architecture librarians reflects this, as do the position titles of art information professionals, the number of art libraries participating in inter-institutional digital GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) initiatives and the publications produced by the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA). The Society's digital humanities initiatives are not exclusive to its special interest group dedicated to digital humanities, the DH SIG, now nearly a decade old.Footnote 2 Members of many groups, sections, and divisions across ARLIS/NA spearhead and contribute to DH projects, with the collaborative underpinning of digital humanities supporting inter-institutional engagement and innovation. In the following brief overview of recent DH work undertaken in US art libraries, engagement with digital humanities is evidenced by the development of open access projects, the creation of linked data sets and the innovative sharing of art and archives collections to support digital pedagogy.  The Humanities Commons is a platform for open information sharing in the Humanities. Based on the open-source Commons in a Box software, the Humanities Commons began as a project of the Modern Language Association (MLA) and is now maintained by Michigan State University.Footnote 3 In 2018, the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons Planning Task Force recommended that the society adopt Humanities Commons as a “network for facilitating communication and collaboration between members of scholarly communities.”Footnote 4 Subsequently, an Implementation Task Force was formed to develop a branded portal for ARLIS/NA on the Humanities Commons. ARLIS/NA is expected to join the MLA, the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES), the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) and the College Art Association (CAA), on the platform as a participating organization later this year. A dedicated area for ARLIS/NA members and ARLIS/NA publications will encourage engagement both within and across organizations and disciplines in the Humanities. Two projects, A Digital Humanities Bibliography and the Digital Art History Directory, demonstrate the promise of the Commons.  A Digital Humanities Bibliography was recently deposited in CORE, the Humanities Commons shared repository. CORE provides a permanent URL with digital object identifier (DOI), subject and keyword tagging and a download count. In three months there were 235 downloads of the DH Bibliography, which includes 1500 citations, organized alphabetically, on topics including but not limited to the arts.Footnote 5 Documents in the CORE repository can be affiliated with multiple groups (such as Digital Art History and Digital Humanists) as well as a particular organization (such as the upcoming ARLIS/NA Commons) to improve discoverability. The traditional bibliography, even for a newer topic like Digital Humanities, remains a useful tool, and enjoys a wider audience and persistent access in the shared repository.  In addition to structured, open access to publications, it is possible to develop custom projects on the Humanities Commons. The ARLIS/NA Commons will soon feature the Digital Art History Directory (DAHD), a project led by Michelle Wilson, Samantha Deutch and Roger Lawson and supported by the ARLIS/NA Catag Section, Digital Humanities SIG, Web Archiving SIG and Systems Librarian Working Group. The DAHD is a dynamic resource “for discovering, sharing and researching digital art history (DAH) projects. The DAHD is intended to be the largest, most comprehensive and inclusive collection of information on digital art history and to function as a tool and living resource, rather than a static publication.”Footnote 6 Projects submitted for inclusion, which may range from best practices to data sources to digital projects and bibliographies, will undergo a review process prior to publication. A well-designed, user-friendly interface, along with a locally created taxonomy for project types, and subject and keyword searching make the directory an indispensable resource for discovering digital art history. In the deluge of digital information, this project again underscores the place of traditional library work, such as compiling bibliographies, directories and indices, in the digital age. Here changes in technology do not usurp the bibliographer's role; rather they permit bibliographers to facilitate access to non-traditional resources, often not published commercially and not indexed in subscription databases.  The flexible platform of the Humanities Commons, which is built on WordPress, hosts initiatives of different scales, ranging from a single document to the interactive directory discussed above, as well as a group organizing space. The DH SIG will begin its transition to the ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons soon after launch by migrating its WordPress website. With shared interests and an informal organizational structure, the DH SIG provides a welcoming place for members exploring digital humanities for the first time, for discovering useful tools and projects and to incubate ideas and collaborations. The DH SIG plans to adopt communication channels available in the Commons including a calendar, social networking features and collaborative document and file sharing. The centralized tools will improve connection between members, streamline the wide variety of communication outlets employed intermittently over the last decade and allow members to publicize their projects on the platform where they are hosted.  Another initiative where a wide variety of organizations and librarians in many roles, including art librarians, have come together is Wikidata, the linked data repository behind Wikipedia and other Wikimedia initiatives. The Wikidata Pilot Project of the Program for Cooperative Cataloguing (PCC) explores identity management through Wikidata. Participating libraries meet monthly for training and discussion of Wikidata or linked data topics. Libraries who have joined the PCC Wikidata Pilot with projects focused on art-related linked data include the Frick Art Reference Library, Michigan State University, the National Gallery of Art, the New Mexico State Library, New York University, Northwestern University, Oklahoma State University, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Smithsonian. Linked data will be created on topics including artists, specifically, from Black, Latinx and Native American communities; artists’ files; art historians/historiography; works of art, including portraits, manga, and campus public art and architecture; archival and special collections; art materials; exhibitions; and government publications.Footnote 7  It is not necessary to participate in the PCC Wikidata Pilot Project to work with Wikidata or linked data. Vanderbilt University and the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, have developed their own projects to share metadata from art museum collections with Wikidata.Footnote 8 Another pilot project exploring bulk transformation of structured data from ContentDM into linked data is OCLC's “Transforming Metadata into Linked Data.” The project report confirms the value of linked data for discovery and visualization, but also notes the difficulties of reconciling data without some manual input and the long-term timeline for the shift to linked data.Footnote 9 Awareness of these linked data projects is important even for librarians who do not catalogue or otherwise create datasets. Once in Wikidata, this data may be used for visualizations, textual analysis or provide access to public domain images useful to art researchers. There will be opportunities to learn about linked data at the ARLIS/NA 49th Annual Conference, which will feature a presentation on linked data from the Frick Art Reference Library and the National Gallery as well as a workshop for beginners, Wikidata for Art Librarians, hosted by the DH SIG and conducted by Will Kent of the Wikimedia Foundation.  The rich data available in Wikidata populates network visualizations and informs a variety of other DH projects. Additionally, conversations about representing communities and languages in linked data and the critical approaches necessary to describe them equitably align with interdisciplinary humanities inquiry. DH visualizations provide an avenue for communicating the complex contextuality of these issues to a wider audience.Footnote 10  Wikidata connects data creators with one of the widest audiences available – users of Wikipedia. Names of artists, works of art, exhibitions, and publications, can supplement and support contributions to Wikipedia. For example, the “info boxes” or “knowledge panels” displayed in both Wikipedia and Google searches display data from Wikidata.Footnote 11 Adding exhibition histories and citations to Wikidata can help establish artists from marginalized communities as “notable” for inclusion in Wikipedia.Footnote 12 ARLIS/NA members have been active as Wikipedia editors, not only in the DH SIG, but across the organization. Recent edit-a-thons for the Art + Feminism Wikipedia group have included the National Museum Women in the Arts Library focusing on women artists of color; Respect Her Crank: A Go-Go Herstory Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon from the Smithsonian Libraries; The Walker Art Center editing articles of womxn artists in the Walker's exhibition Don't let this be easy, among many others. Additionally, Yale and MIT Libraries held the BIPOC in the Built virtual Wikipedia edit-a-thon, a week-long event to create Wikipedia pages for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) artists, architects and designers. No experience is needed to participate in a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and extensive guidance on organizing a local event is available from Art + Feminism and Wikimedia.Footnote 13  Digital skill building meets visual literacy in Building Visual Literacy: A Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Teaching from University Art Collections. Created by Washington and Lee University's University Collection of Art and Art History in partnership with the University Library, these object-based lesson plans “cultivate visual literacy abilities to interpret and evaluate the world around us—important tools for student success in any discipline or career field.”Footnote 14 Photogrammetry of Uncle Tom's Cabin Vase, one of the toolkit lessons, offers a user-friendly overview of this technique for creating a three-dimensional model of a ceramic vase, paired with suggestions for teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Similarly, a Drew University librarian Danielle Reay developed a three-dimensional model to teach visual literacy skills. Using historic documents from the university archives, Reay virtually reconstructed a demolished library building for a research skill building exercise for architecture students.Footnote 15  Since over the past months it has not been possible to travel for museum fieldtrips or the site visits integral to the architecture studio, virtual reality may be evolving from interesting technology into technological necessity. A pilot project at the Frances Loeb Library of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design supported virtual site visits for architecture students in two studio courses. Despite the short turnaround time for the project, site documentation, including videos, was collected for reuse in future courses through the library collections portal.Footnote 16 In this way, DH enhanced the traditional library role of collection development and efficient access to resources. The University of Calgary developed a virtual reality (VR) artist in residence program for art and architecture students. It is an innovative combination of a badge program and a residency. Students receive training, access to VR equipment and applications and other support needed to deliver a shareable VR project by the end of the residency.Footnote 17  Additionally, several three-dimensional collections have been digitized in two dimensions for the first time. The ARLIS/NA 2020 conference presentation Reimagining Unique Collections through Digitization highlighted an 1893 World's Fair panorama captured in glass lantern slides at the University of Kansas, textiles and garments from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Textile Resource Center collection, and fiber arts artist files from The Friends of Fiber Art International Artist File Collection of the American Craft Council.Footnote 18 The Frances Loeb Library and the Rhode Island School of Design Fleet Library launched Material Order Search, a shared digital library of design materials. Robust search and browse features are built on a custom taxonomy for materials that includes production company, usage, composition, and sensorial properties, for example, “touch - rough” to describe the tactile sensation of a particular texture.Footnote 19  Traditional digital collections of visual resources centers and archives are being reimagined as digital humanities projects in increasingly creative ways. The Yale Arts Library brought a traditional art history visual resources collection into more than a thousand dimensions with PixPlot.Footnote 20 PixPlot visualizes a complex neural network using common three-dimensional game design techniques. The result is a highly interactive visualization tool that helps users see connections between objects in new ways. Images from the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale Center for British Art and the Medical Historical Library have also been visualized in PixPlot.  IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is the image display and sharing technology behind many recent innovative visual digital humanities projects, including PixPlot.Footnote 21 Several recent IIIF applications from the Getty Research Center stand out: 12 Sunsets, the Research Collections Viewer and the Animal Crossing Art Generator. 12 Sunsets visualizes more than 60,000 of Ed Ruscha's Sunset Strip photographs. Website visitors maneuver Ruscha's pickup truck along Sunset Boulevard or search by year, time of day, street, tag or keyword to explore the photographs. The Research Collections Viewer provides a more traditional archival view of the same collection and several others. The simple interface contains a novel visualization of the collection hierarchy as well as metadata, permissions, the image comparison viewer, and IIIF manifests. The Animal Crossing Art Generator takes artworks out of the museum—The Getty or any museum that provides IIIF images—and into a popular game by Nintendo called Animal Crossing.Footnote 22 Players find a IIIF manifest URL, paste it into a form on the Getty site to generate a QR code, which will download the artwork onto a wall or an easel inside the game.Footnote 23  In addition to the novel applications noted above, IIIF may be used for traditional art historical image comparison within a single collection as well as across institutions. At the Henry E. Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, Mario Einaudi trains schoolteachers to use ContentDM with IIIF and Mirador to provide dynamic presentations in the classroom. For example, a zoomable map of Chinatown may be contextualized with a detail of a neighborhood as well as historical maps, street views, photographs or objects simultaneously.Footnote 24  As the foundation of many digital humanities projects, digitized collections are included in this overview of recent digital humanities initiatives alongside innovative approaches to manipulating digitized images in the humanities. Despite established workflows and technological advances that have made digitization efforts and digital exhibitions routine, many barriers remain, and many collections are not yet digitized. The authors of Reimagining Unique Collections mention challenges such as communication with vendors; rights clearance; and ongoing server and site maintenance. Digital preservation remains perpetually on the horizon. As Meghan Lyon has observed in her assessment of digitized artists’ archives, “challenges include providing access to an intelligibly navigable and publicly engaging platform; maintaining cohesion, context, and credibility; balancing copyright, privacy, and access; and facilitating cross-institutional collaboration.”Footnote 25  Many digitization projects are noteworthy simply as unique digital surrogates, and many have overcome significant impediments, often without a budget. In this sense, small-scale projects brought to fruition merit recognition alongside more innovative, programmatic approaches to digital humanities in the arts. During the last year as courses moved online and museum capacities were reduced, many digital projects were created, and this overview covers only a very small percentage of DH work in libraries. Employees and resources were reallocated from other departments to create metadata or transcriptions for digital collections remotely. Even with pandemic delays, it became apparent that a great deal could be accomplished under extraordinary circumstances with a relatively small shift in focus.  Another urgent shift, unrelated to the pandemic, is happening. The Maryland Institute Black Archives (MIBA) or Blackives project, by student Deyane Moses, provides some of the clearest evidence that despite the vast number of digital collections, digital humanities projects and digital archives created in art libraries and museums, there are many stories that have not been told.Footnote 26 MIBA documents the Black experience at the College from its beginning in 1892, to a 1935 exhibition on lynching, to 1954, when admission was opened up to students of color, through to the present day. In a 2016 conversation with the LA Review of Books, Jessica Marie Johnson reflected, “DH has offered people the means and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far as I'm concerned….If there isn't a place for this type of work within what we are talking about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty conversation.”Footnote 27 It is vital for art information professionals who create data from collections, develop state-of-the-art interoperability across systems and press forward with new digital tools, to take the time to look backward, to discover gaps in collections and to support colleagues and communities in efforts to rebuild their own histories through digital humanities.  The digital humanities have enabled art libraries to extend the reach of many traditional functions such as collection building and development, bibliographic instruction, providing access to unique materials and original cataloguing in support of art and architecture fields. Collections now house multimodal representations of architectural sites and digital assets in many dimensions. Instruction covers digital techniques such as photogrammetry and visual literacy not only for art and architecture, but across disciplines. Name authorities are being linked in a truly global database, Wikidata, and bibliographies such as the Digital Art History Directory help patrons sort through an abundance of digital art historical projects in a few clicks. The ARLIS/NA Humanities Commons will provide an opportunity to carry out the professional work of art libraries in a truly collaborative fashion. Upcoming projects from ARLIS/NA members include visualization services; digital privacy; crowdsourcing data; art faculty data and research impact assessment; digital accessibility; digital project preservation; digital publishing and open educational resources (OER); multimodal storytelling; virtual reality artist residencies; and oral histories, to name a few — as art librarians continue to increase engagement with their collections through the digital humanities. 1.

"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: What Does A Photograph Sound Like? Digital Image
          Sonification As Synesthetic AudioVisual Digital Humanities";"Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual
          material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial
          produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new
          artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh
          ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object
          into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew,
          with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by
          cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the
          aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital
          transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and
          deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching,
          remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing
          at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes
          from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music
          revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image
          sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music
          being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the
          silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does
          help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy,
          and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as
          well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected
          perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a
          cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges,
          activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH
          activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.";http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000508/000508.html;
"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: A Digital Humanities Approach to Narrative Voice in The Secret Scripture: Proposing a New Research
               Method";"This paper is situated within debates surrounding modes of “close” and
                  “distant reading”
               [Moretti 2000] as they are played out in both the fields of world
               literature and digital literary studies. It proposes an alternative digital
               humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close
               comparative reading rather than the mode of “distant reading” endorsed by Franco
               Moretti and Alan Liu [Liu 2012]. Specifically, the research method
               proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The
                  Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative
               reference to Pat Barker’s well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a
               digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary
               analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be
                  “practicing partners” in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields
               of world literature and digital literary studies. I’ve only known one 100-year old, and she hardly spoke at
                  all. Most centurions, I’d wager, limit themselves to “pardon?” and “the nurses are stealing my clothes,” and few
                  if any are capable of eloquence like this: “There
                     was a black river that flowed through the town, and if it had no grace for the
                     mortal beings, it did for swans and many swans resorted there, and even rode
                     the river like some kind of plunging animals, in floods. (The Valve, 29 September 2008)”
                Rivers developed a therapeutic treatment based upon the
                  principle of catharsis whereby the patient was encouraged to eschew repressive
                  tendencies and give voice to the traumatic memories […] without dwelling
                  excessively upon them. Patient and physician would work together to construct from
                  these painful memories a narrative that found some tolerable, or redeeming, even
                  pleasant association for the trauma. [Hemmings 2005, 114]
                Much is made of
                  this idea in Ulysses: could possibly be an allusion
                  to it. But equally possibly not. Certainly this passage has modernist echoes — the
                  classical and the mundane.";http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/000178.html;
"DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the
                    Globalization Compendium";"In the digital humanities we specialize in imagining and
                    launching digital projects, but we rarely consider how to
                    end them. In this paper we propose to discuss the ends of a
                    particular digital project as a case study for the planning
                    of ending. The project we focus on is the Globalization and
                    Autonomy Online Compendium that was developed as a digital
                    outcome of the Globalization and Autonomy project.
                    Specifically, this paper will:  Survey the general issues at stake when planning
                            for the end of a digital project; Provide some background on the project and the
                            Compendium;Discuss the underlying technologies that had to be
                            dealt with; Address the specific problem of ending and how we
                            prepared this project for archival deposit; And conclude by talking about some other ends
                            that are really beginnings.
 When can a digital scholarly project
                        be considered finally “done”? Perhaps never.
                        Something done is past, irrevocable, requiring nothing
                        more and indeed immune from further action.

ANN: Exploring the Caribbean in DH: A dLOC as Data workshop series | H-LatAm | H-Net;Much as archipelagos—a journal of Caribbean digital praxis pushes us to recognize, scholars of the Caribbean “are called upon now, with some urgency, to adapt our investigative and pedagogical methods to an academic climate deluged by a superabundance of information and analysis.” This ‘digital turn’ comes with much possibility, of course – just as the pages of archipelagos attest – but it can also be a daunting turn to navigate. In the hopes of encouraging more Caribbean-focused digital humanities scholarship and collaboration, the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) is pleased to present Exploring the Caribbean in DH: A dLOC as Data workshop series. This workshop series is for anyone interested in either Caribbean Studies or digital humanities. It will plot and explore the landscape of data sources in Caribbean Studies, and will provide space to think about and discuss how to identify and use various Caribbean data sources. Across the various workshops, participants will work with dLOC’s own collections – getting a sneak peak at the dLOC as Data project in the process – and other resources to develop new skills and explore new possibilities for digital inquiry. The series will explore various technical, conceptual, and ethical considerations for such work as well. All of the workshops will be held via Zoom. There is no cost to join, but advance registration is required. Please see below for individual workshop details – and note that there are more to come. For any questions, please contact mad320@miami.edu. This series is sponsored by the Collections as Data initiative, a Mellon Foundation-supported program.   Foundations: Delving into Newspaper DataJune 4, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit This workshop uses the DLOC Newspaper collection to explore the critical role of primary source data in archival research. The session will help participants think through the following questions: The workshop will employ theories of close and distant reading (broadly defined) to help participants explore select titles in the DLOC newspaper collection and will also analyze digital projects using DLOC newspaper resources as primary data to evaluate the collection’s strengths, gaps and possibilities for telling Caribbean stories. To register, please  here: REGISTER.   Student Workshop: Dreaming with DataJune 11, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit This workshop takes the rhetorical exercise of inquiry as a point of departure for navigating DLOC data. We will use rhetorical analysis as the framework for searching and analyzing items and collections in the database. Participants will employ a “search and serendipity” method as a point of entry into the portal and use the inquiry framework to define, refine and their research questions and project design. The goal of this approach is to interrogate and challenge the colonial concept of “discovery” in archival research, by positioning the student researcher as a practitioner of care for archival material of all kinds. This workshop is ideal for students with big ideas or broad topics of interest who are curious about working with digital data collections and want to use them to help clarify their thinking and refine their research questions and strategy. Participants do not need to have any experience with digital humanities or computational analysis, but should be prepared to come to the workshop with a broad research topic in mind. With specific attention to the digital collections of DLOC, participants will be guided to use primary sources as the catalyst to turn ideas into research questions, then into more formal projects. During the workshop, participants will be introduced to and work with digital concept mapping with Miro software to create a subject or keyword matrix. We will explore the interfaces of DLOC and Chronicling America, and use select data sets from these including Dominica Herald, Abeng (Jamaica) and Barbados Mercury to discuss connections and themes emerging from the matrix in order to refine research questions. The workshop will also introduce students to methods and tools for searching and analyzing bulk data, including MALLET and Voyant, used for topic modeling in digital humanities contexts. To register, please  here: REGISTER.   Ethical Re-use: Disaster Related DataJune 18, 11am-12:30pm EDTFacilitated by Dr. Schuyler Esprit The Caribbean is a historically vulnerable region for many reasons, including its relationship to climate and the environment. The region’s experience with extreme disasters – from the magnitude 7earthquake in Haiti to Category 5 hurricanes barrelling through many countries’ and now the eruption of the volcano at St. Vincent’s La Soufriere – and with public health threats, including Chikungunya, Dengue fever, Zika and now COVID-19, is well documented. As a result of the frequency and intensity of these events, the region’s history of disasters is now a major focus of Caribbean Studies research. DLOC data becomes valuable for contextualizing our current moment through the lens of the Caribbean’s sociopolitical and environmental history. This workshop aims to reflect on the theories and praxis of research and data use, and to think through best practices for navigating data about disaster. The workshop will address some key topics including: To register, please  here: REGISTER.   More workshops to be announced soon! Copyright © 1993 - 2021.

Francesca D’Amico-Cuthbert | Toronto Hip-Hop & the Music Marketplace — Human Stories;"Dr. Francesca D'Amico-Cuthbert is the 2020-2021 Community-Engaged Early Career Postdoctoral Fellow at the Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto. A trained historian, Dr. D’Amico-Cuthbert’s research explores the history of American and Canadian Black popular music, the creative industries and the music marketplace with expertise in Rap music and Hip-Hop culture. Her PhD work traced how Black rappers in the era of mass incarceration constructed complex ethnographies of urban spaces, transformed dispositions of power, and unmasked the modes and mechanisms of a persistent and haunting coloniality in the afterlives of American slavery. Her current postdoctoral research explores Toronto Rap music’s relationship to commerce, anti-Black market segmentation and the availability of state revenue streams and marketplace exposure – and in doing so, highlight a social history of power relations between Toronto Hip Hop practitioners, creative marketplace elites, and state-actors. Currently, Dr. D’Amico-Cuthbert also serves on the Education Committee of the Universal Museum of Hip Hop – which is dedicated to the preservation of Hip Hop’s history and is set to open in 2024 in the Bronx, New York City.

English Market goes interactive | Cork Independent;"By Geraldine Fitzgerald Cork’s famed English Market attracts visitors from all over the globe, and a new website by a UCC student recalls its history in fascinating detail. Student Daniella Traynor created an interactive website to explore the socioeconomic history of the English Market as her final year project for UCC’s Digital Humanities and IT degree. She used maps, video, and data visualisations to outline the changes to the English Market over years of redevelopment, fire and a changing food landscape. Exploring SHUA (Socioeconomic History of Urban Areas) was developed by Daniella to use digital tools in an engaging way to examine the history of culturally rich urban areas. The English Market is an institution that “survived revolution and war, fire and famine, depression and boom, changing tastes and intensifying competition, as well as a rapidly changing socioeconomic, food and retail environment,” said Daniella. She added: “It’s the first place I take people when they come to visit me in Cork, so it’s ideal to showcase the method of using deep maps. I wanted to produce a digital artefact that goes beyond its academic application to tell the story online.” Archival video footage and various source materials act as a guide through the tumultuous history of the English Market from the early 20th century to modern day. The site shows the market’s place in Cork culture, while focusing on the detail of the history of individual traders, and the ebb and flow of the various stalls over time. “I learned not only about the tools and technologies involved in deep mapping, but the captivating story of the market we know and love today,” she added. Surprisingly, until Daniella’s project launched there was no publicly available map of the current internal layout of the Market nor any comparative maps of the changes through the years. She said: “Huge thanks to Cork City Council for being so helpful throughout the process and allowing me to bring the project to life. Also, I had the support of the incredible Digital Humanities department at UCC where I learned so much and was able to combine my passion for computing with my interest in society and history. I was so grateful for the opportunity.” “I hope to use my qualifications to pursue a career in humane technology to promote and preserve local and national communities, using a digital approach,” she concluded.

"Lecture by Smiljana Antonijević "" Scholars as Bricoleurs: The Plurality of Digital Humanities"". Recording and interview. | C2DH | Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History";"While theoretical debates about the role of digital scholarship in the humanities abound, comprehensive empirical studies are relatively rare. In her talk, Smiljana Antonijević discussed findings of an ethnographic study of 250 scholars described in the presenter’s book “Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production."" She looked at how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies in their research workflows. In a bricolage manner, humanists construct their digital workflows from a diverse range of tools and methods suited to their preferences and needs, engaging with digital technologies in an unscripted and highly personal way that corresponds to their style of thinking and working, to their intimate epistemology. The “unruly” approach of bricolage may be outside the boundary of most DH theory yet, as Antonijević showed, it is important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and engage with this variety of voices and non-canonical technology uses, in order to pave the way for the pluralistic future of digital knowledge production in the humanities.    In this online video interview, Smiljana Antonijević discusses her background in Communication/New Media Studies and Anthropology and how she came to be interested in Digital Humanities. She then talks about her interest in the question of how scholars engage with digital technologies in their research workflows and the ethnographic work she did to uncover these. Finally, she also discusses how the insights gained could be translated into tool development and how her work related to where the digital humanities are currently headed. Dr. Smiljana Antonijević explores the intersection of communication, culture, and technology through research and teaching in the USA and Europe. She is the author of Amongst Digital Humanists: An Ethnographic Study of Digital Knowledge Production (2015), while her other recent publications focus on ethnography of DH coding (2020), data ethnography (2019), Internet and trust (2019), humanists’ digital workflows (2018), and others. In addition to academic work, Smiljana is engaged in applied research in Silicon Valley, focusing on artificial intelligence, intelligent automation, and digital security.

 Title: Digital Humanities and African Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities, Embracing Challenges
 Abstract: The increasing interpenetration of computer science and technology with other disciplines outside the natural sciences has continued to accentuate the increasing importance of the digital transformation impacting our lives and society. Digital Humanities (DH), an emerging off shoot of this global digital revolution, espouses the deployment of new tools and techniques to retool humanistic scholarship and increase the use of social and cultural data for regional and global development. This presentation discusses how the academe and African scholars can explore new technologies to recalibrate their research endeavours and impact. Despite some perceived challenges, it is argued that these new approaches can reinvent, reconfigure and galvanize research and social transformation in Africa.

Sketchfab Community Blog -  » Digital Humanities at the Perm State University Museum;Cultural heritage digitization at Perm University became possible due to the collaboration of the Center for Digital Humanities and the Perm University History Museum. The project team has an interdisciplinary background and is represented by historians, digital humanities specialists and museum workers who are open to active dialogue and using information technologies to enable wider involvement and recognition of cultural heritage in science, education, art and other fields. The project team is represented by experienced researchers – professor Sergey Kornienko, associate professor Nadezhda Povroznik, associate professor Maria Romashova, Perm University History Museum deputy director Elena Tararukhina, as well as a younger generation – graduate student Iliana Ismakaeva, and college student Arkady Zenkov. Nadezhda Povroznik (CV), an associate professor and employee of the Center for Digital Humanities, is the initiator of a program which is applying 3D-modeling and digitizing of museum exhibits based on photogrammetry technology at the History Museum. Being an historian with a Ph.D. in History, Nadezhda seeks to expand opportunities for studying the Museum’s collections, individual exhibits, their history, as well as the implementation of the 3D models for different purposes – in research, education, creative projects, etc. The Center for Digital Humanities was created in 2016 at Perm State University to conduct interdisciplinary research in the fields of digital humanities and historical information science, virtual museology, development of infrastructure of digital historical and cultural heritage, and the development and implementation of educational courses in undergraduate and graduate programs in the field of information technologies in the humanities. Elena Tararukhina (CV), Perm University History Museum deputy director, is a philologist with extensive experience in project management in the field of contemporary art. Finding herself at the museum with an antique collection was an unexpected challenge for her. But the experience of re-thinking ancient heritage using new technologies, as it turned out, offers great potential. The collection of Perm University History Museum is quite eclectic: in one exhibition space one can see photographs, documents, maps, various devices, stuffed birds, test tubes, and objects from the epoch of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome together. One of the most important collections of art is not fully publicly available. It appeared along with the opening of the university in 1916 for educational purposes and illustrates the diversity of everyday life and the culture of various civilizations. The collection consists of ancient Greek and Egyptian objects of bronze, glass, bone and ceramic, Western European engravings of the XVIII – XIX centuries, and exhibits of Russian and Eastern applied art.  A couple of years ago we started working on the website, a platform that unites the museums of Perm University. At the same time, the idea to create a virtual museum was put forward. We started by adding interactive historical maps of the university in the city and a virtual tour of the exhibition “I Know How to Control the Universe” and a panorama of the museum memorial wall. The next stage was an experiment with 3D-modeling and placement of annotated three-dimensional models of the most valuable exhibits in the virtual museum. Understanding the opportunities for presenting museum objects in three dimensions was the motivation for the first experiments. Thanks to the support of the Perm University Endowment Fund, the first digital collection of the Museum’s antique objects was made. It included ancient Greek vessels, figurines, and theatrical masks. Due to the lack of the required amount of space, part of the museum collection is not represented in the exhibition. For example, now only Greek and Roman objects are available for public access. Interchangeable exhibitions certainly solve this problem partly, but the interest of visitors is always broader than the exposition capabilities of a small museum. Thus, the gradual expansion of the virtual space allows us to expand the accessibility of our collections. Every year Perm University History Museum holds a “Museum Night” at Perm University, in which university museums and a botanical garden participate. In the laboratory format, the curators of the festival art program acquaint artists with museum collections and offer to reflect on them in the university space. The digitized collection is always a big bonus in terms of mobility and accessibility, which is very important for the inspiration of artists. 3D-modeling is also integrated into the educational process, which is appropriate, since the museum collection was collected primarily for educational purposes. The Center for Digital Humanities initiated and launched the Master’s program “Digital Socio-Cultural and Art Practices” within “Cultural Studies”, in which a portion of the courses is devoted to working with historical and cultural heritage, digitizing museum objects, developing virtual museum space and creating 3D models of museum objects. We emphasize that it is fundamentally important in the work of future specialists of museums and the GLAM-industry (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) as a whole to deal with real objects of cultural heritage. One of the positive effects is communication and experience exchange within the museum community, which is connected with the expansion of the possibilities of using 3D models in the museum’s inclusive programs and other projects. One of our recent models was the ritual object shabti. The ancient Egyptians imagined that, having died, a person must pass many trials, after which he or she, in the best case scenario, appeared at the Field of Reeds – an exact replica of the Nile Valley. There they had to work. In order not to work by themselves, the Egyptians made shabties (translated as “respondent” from ancient Egyptian) – figurines, usually made of faience, symbolizing helpers. Text written on shabti: “Enlightenment of the face. Osiris royal scribe Djedher, true of voice, born Wadjet, true of voice”. This shabti can be attributed to the late period (664-332 B.C.). The ancient Egyptian museum collection has many opportunities for research. 3D-modeling and placement on the Sketchfab platform invite further scientific interest (both Russian and foreign) in confirming precise definitions of text, dating, as well as building a network of objects from one archaeological site that went to different parts of the world. The process of creating 3D models can be divided into several stages:  For photography, a camera with interchangeable lenses is used. Small-sized exhibits are photographed using a Canon Macro Lens EF 100mm f / 2.8 Macro USM lens for a Canon EOS 600D camera. Large and immobile stationary objects are photographed using a conventional Canon EF-S 18-135mm f / 3.5-5.6 lens IS STM. Museum objects are processed on a rotating graduated platform in a 60 cm-high softbox. Illumination with an adjustable angle of inclination is set on three sides – on the top, left and right of the softbox. Top lighting is installed on a special bar. LED illuminators with a low level of heating are used as illuminants. The camera is fixed on a tripod to get better pictures and minimize distortion when shooting. We began experiments with photogrammetric technology using amateur equipment and a desire to get high-quality models. We noticed that, in general, medium-sized models were of an acceptable quality, while small exhibits had low quality due to shooting with a simple lens. Therefore, a special macro lens was acquired, which is currently used to shoot small exhibits for higher resolution and more detailed texture. There are always situations when something is missing due to lack of professional equipment or expert knowledge, but these problems can be addressed. Today, even having amateur equipment and limited experience and skills allows you to make high quality models. The main thing is the desire and understanding for why this is necessary, and working with a friendly team. We have a wonderful university collaboration between the Center for Digital Humanities and the Museum of History, and together we turned our first experiments with 3D-modelling into a promising and dynamic project that gradually has moved beyond the usual creation of a digital collection. As for the museum of history of Perm University, 3D-modeling now expands our capabilities as follows: We have already started new experiments, this time related to the 3D-printing of the ancient models (the 3D-model was modified and printed by Feodor Yurganov, a master student). The first trial object was the oenochoe, an antique vessel used in ancient Greek wine-drinking rituals. The vessel was created in the 7th century BC and is one of the most valuable and significant objects of the Museum. It is not surprising that the oenochoe became the first printed object, because there was an additional interest in creating a 3D model of this vessel. Let’s look at the three-petal neck structure. There was no obvious answer: was this form a purely aesthetic feature of the vessel or did it have some practical sense when a cupbearer could pour wine at the same time in three other vessels for further direct use by feast participants? The printed model helped to answer this question. It was impossible to pour into three vessels at the same time. Today 3D-modeling can be the starting point for creating interdisciplinary connections, and long-term cooperation, including in interactive and gaming environments. From an emotional point of view, this is a figure of Osiris, which is not in very good condition in reality, but at the same time it has a number of features that indicate the fine work of the master. The surviving feathers on the crown, enamel on the eyes and uraeus convey the features of a perfect image. But the main thing here is Osiris’s frozen smile, as if everything is in order, and he is in his place.   Digital Humanities at Perm State / Perm State University’s Museum / PSU Digital Humanities Facebook / PSU Museum Facebook   About the author  Perm State University Your email address will not be published.

The one-week summer school will involve 5 intensive training days where the learners have an opportunity to gain thorough understanding of the role of a Research Software Engineer in Digital Humanities research. This is an introductory course open to all (including postgraduate students, early career researchers, data scientists), and will require full time (8h/ day) or part time (4h/ day) remote attendance for a week in the UK timezone (BST) - see more below.  Morning lectures will introduce examples of research projects in Digital Humanities (DH) that have strongly benefitted from the contribution of Research Software Engineering (RSE) experts in the team. The afternoon sessions will consist of hands-on activities on the topics presented in the morning. Each day will finish with an open discussion with a speaker on their career in between RSE and Digital Humanities. Please note you can apply either for the lectures only (theory) OR for both lectures and practicals (full experience of the summer school). You will have an option in the application form to select which of these you are interested in.  Opening talks by Barbara McGillivray on the challenges and prospects of the intersection of Humanities and Data Science at the Alan Turing Institute and on REG role in Living with Machines by Ruth Ahnert and David Beavan, PI and Co-I on the project. Afternoon activity on integrating Git-flow when collaboratively developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool for Digital History in Python (by Federico Nanni, Kasra Hosseini and Mariona Coll Ardanuy). DH-RSE Stories by Giovanni Colavizza (previously at Turing Research Engineering Group and Living with Machines Co-I) on his career path back-and-forth between Digital Humanities and Software Engineering. Best practices in coding for humanities research to make code more open, reproducible and sustainable. Morning talks on recent DH projects in Cambridge where research software has been integral to research outputs. Coding activity in Python on organising and evolving code projects for usability, re-use and automation. DH-RSE Stories by Mary-Chester Kadwell on the 'coding journey' that individuals take as they go through their careers: developing individuals and code in tandem. Present your result efficiently: using code and interactive tools for data visualisation in humanities and social science. Best practices and pathways to generate more informative, reusable and open visualisations of your datasets. The day starts with a keynote on “Data Visualization: From Exploration to Storytelling to Participation” by Benjamin Bach. We then provide two activities in sequence: The first activity is a hands-on tutorial on network visualization using The Vistorian (vistorian.github.io). The 2nd activity is offered in R - participants are not required to have knowledge of it - it is part of the training activity to experience working on a project in a non-familiar programming language. The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by Lucy Havens., who will share her path from a degree in Information Systems to a job in business and technology consulting, and from there to research positions at the intersection of design, data science, and the humanities. A Sustainable Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model for RSE. The morning session will look at case studies and introduce the SDLC, with contributions from other members of the Lab. The afternoon will be delivered in medium length sessions which apply SDLC principles to hypothetical research project scenarios, working in groups to refine requirements and priorities, and to plan a digital strategy. Presented by Neil Jakeman and Ginestra Ferraro. Opening talks by Dave De Roure and Jane Winters on current and future landscape in UK and beyond for DH&RSE. Coding activity by Federico Nanni and Sarah Gibson on using MyBinder for research reproducibility in digital humanities contexts. DH-RSE Stories by Olivia Vane and summer school wrap-up by Federico Nanni. Deliver an overview of Research Software Engineering (RSE) tailored to the specificities of Humanities research Illustrate the importance of best RSE practices to build reliable, efficient and reproducible code in Digital Humanities (DH) Showcase the fruitful integration of RSE within important UK DH research projects Discuss the career path that DH-RSE people have taken Highlight how the summer school could become the first step towards a more structured training scheme Learning outcomes Structured overview of RSE best practices and their integration in DH Clearer understanding of their personal RSE skill-set Familiarity with the broad role / competencies of a RSE in a research project Consider RSE as a career path  The course is open to anyone but especially to Digital Humanities scholars with a few years of experience in using a programming language (preferably Python). The attendees additionally need to be familiar with the academic debate around the benefits and issues of the use of computational methods and infrastructure in Humanities research projects, as this topic will often emerge in talks / discussions. If the participants have research experience with some of the topics taught at the Oxford Digital Humanities Summer School they possess the knowledge to participate in this Summer School. Otherwise good starting points are: Our Summer School positions itself ideally between the preparation offered by 3) and 4). It is meant to prepare people that have worked in DH for a few years to allow them to move into RSE. Therefore, while 4) covers the most important RSE topics, we are not expecting participants to be familiar with all of them. However accessing these materials would allow them to better assess their current knowledge of the field. Additionally, it will allow the attendees to familiarise themselves with the RSE culture / topics. Regarding the debate around the pros and cons of adopting computational methods in humanities research, good overviews are offered in:;https://www.eventsforce.net/training/dh-rse;

EADH 2022 Call for Hosts | EADH - The European Association for Digital Humanities;The EADH Executive Committee invites proposals for Local Organisers (LO) to host the 2022 EADH Conference. The EADH Conference is organised each year that the annual ADHO Digital Humanities conference takes place outside of Europe, and has the objective to strengthen the scientific, institutional and cultural relations between the members of the DH communities in Europe and the Mediterranean area. EADH is particularly interested in proposals from institutions and regions that: Please note that the lead applicant must be a direct member of the EADH or of one of its Associate Organisations (currently AIUCD [Italy], DHD [Germany], DHN [Nordic Countries], CzADH [Czechia], and DH Russia). EADH Conferences are co-organised by two committees: The scientific organisation is conducted by a Programme Committee (PC) between 8 and 14 members and one Chair, appointed by the EADH Executive Committee. The local organiser may appoint up to two members of the PC. The PC decides the main theme of the conference, identifies and invites keynote speakers, produces and issues the Call for Papers, manages the review process, and decides the academic conference programme. The logistical organization will be the responsibility of a Local Organisation Committee, whose members and chair are appointed by the Local Organisers. Conference dates are decided by the Local Organiser, in consultation with EADH Executive committee. It is recommended that the conference takes place in the autumn of 2022. Other large DH-related conferences in Europe should be taken into account when fixing the precise dates. The venue must be an academic or cultural institution in the European and Mediterranean area in its broadest sense. The hosting institution should be able to accommodate a minimum of 300 delegates (including plenaries), at least three parallel sessions, and a communicative poster session. The Local Organizers must also have the infrastructure and organizational staff to guarantee online access to delegates and speakers. The availability of accommodations at accessible prices is an element that will be considered in the evaluation of the bid. Bids should contain a preliminary budget and up to two pages describing the motivations and logistical opportunities offered by the proposed venue. Bidders must take into account the EADH diversity and inclusivity statement and the ADHO code of conduct. The venue for the 2022 conference will be decided by the EADH Executive Committee on the basis of: Bids should be submitted to secretary@eadh.org and CC to fabio.ciotti@uniroma2.it no later than June 30, 2021. The Conference should be a 2/3-day event, avoiding weekends. Workshops and training events can precede the official conference days, depending on the availability of the LO. Presentations will be organized in 90-minute slots. The conference should have two keynote plenary talks. Typical presentations are: Bidders in coordination with the Programme Committee are encouraged to propose alternative formats and innovative organization of the conference in addition to this general framework. The conference must be financially self-sustaining or create a small surplus. Surpluses and deficits for conference finances are distributed at a ratio to EADH and to the local organizer according to this formula: 60% ADHO / 40% LOs. In case of loss, EADH backstop funding will not exceed €5,000. The EADH will also provide bursaries for young scholars. At least 50% of EADH’s share of surpluses will be earmarked specifically for future conference travel bursaries and other pro-inclusion actions. The local organizers are expected to set six levels of registration fees: Local Organisers are expected to set member/non-member rates so that the difference between member/non-member rates are higher than the EADH membership costs. Registration fees are recommended not to exceed €300 for the highest level of non-member fees to make the conference more accessible to the community. Local Organisers are expected to arrange a diverse social programme, including a social dinner, that can contribute to the EADH community building. Usually, this social programme will highlight the local culture of the conference venue. Suggested collaborative activities range from hosting workshops and tutorials to co-organisation of the conference or financial support. Private in-kind and financial sponsorship is welcome, provided that any activity from sponsoring organizations is clearly distinct from, and does not influence, the academic program.

ELTE.DH joins DARIAH as Cooperating Partner | DARIAH;The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-EU) is proud to announce it has signed a Cooperating Partnership agreement with the Centre for Digital Humanities (ELTE.DH) at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest, Hungary.  “I’m very excited about our Cooperating Partnership with ELTE,” said Edward J. Gray, the Officer for National Coordination at DARIAH. “This is an important first step toward establishing a closer collaboration with our Hungarian colleagues, and in the future, welcoming Hungary as a full member into the DARIAH family.” ELTE.DH was created by the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) to keep up with the global trends and to create a stable centre for the education and research of digital humanities in 2017. As a research- and practice-oriented scholarly institution, ELTE.DH ensures focus and coherence for all efforts that have been made in the field of digital humanities at the faculty and examines digital research aspects not yet considered.  “It was among the most important tasks of Hungary’s oldest institute of higher education, the Eötvös Loránd University, to adopt the latest scientific and technical advancements in the field of humanities,” said Dr. Gábor Palkó, Head of Department for Digital Humanities at ELTE.  ELTE.DH will contribute to DARIAH by granting access to some of its impressive training and pedagogical materials via DARIAH-CAMPUS, as well as participating in working groups and promoting the exchanges between researchers in Central Europe. The educational and research activities of ELTE.DH are summarized in the ELTE.DH Yearbook. Since 2019, ELTE has introduced over 500 undergraduate students per year to digital humanities coursework, in addition to 150 PhD students who receive specialized attention. As of 2020, ELTE now boasts the first university department dedicated to Digital Humanities in Hungary. For more information on ELTE’s DH courses, check out the DARIAH-CLARIN Digital Humanities Course Registry.  One of ELTE.DH’s key objectives is to help increase the visibility of Hungarian, and in a broader sense, Central European DH research through organising international workshops and conferences. Two major international events took place at ELTE, with a large number of European and non-European participants in 2018 (DH_Budapest_2018) and 2019 (DH_Budapest_2019). The International Journal of Digital Humanities was initiated by researchers at ELTE.DH and its third thematic issue will be published soon. Supported by the Institutional Excellence Program for the Higher Education, ELTE.DH’s researchers focus on the peculiarities and differences of the analogue and digital approaches of textual analysis, ranging from the questions of semantic repository representation and automatic data enrichment of digital heritage, to the handling of biographical and bibliographic data, the use of stylometric and author identification algorithms, and the development of various natural language processing tools. As participants in the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History”, ELTE.DH’s researchers have worked on establishing literary corpora to promote the practice of computer-aided “distant reading”. ELTE.DH is also leading the National Laboratory for Digital Humanities, established on the initiative of the Hungarian Ministry of Innovation and Technology, which aims to develop, in an inter-institutional collaboration, a methodology for the AI-based processing, research and education of national cultural heritage and its widest possible dissemination. The Laboratory focuses on the development of language-processing algorithms based on  machine intelligence, the development of an annotated Gold standard corpus as well as web-archiving of Hungarian language materials.

"TLDR: My Two Year Journey With ""My Struggle."" — Arthur Kibert Basler";"Your Custom Text Here I brought Book 1 on Thanksgiving vacation to Tampa two years ago. It was one of those rare days when I got to read all day. I barely moved from bed. My in-laws played with our newborn daughter, Arwen, just a couple months old. At the time, I didn’t know anything about Knausgaard, the controversial release of My Struggle in Europe, I just knew that the voice in Book 1, the narrator was attempting something genuine, something fierce.  I read Book 1 and 2 in rapid fashion, just a couple months—I couldn’t stop. Arwen was an infant then, barely able to roll over, bottles and diapers and a wonderful smile.  She’s two now and has endless energy, sings all day, and pets puppies with frenzied joy. I finished Book 6 last week, and mostly, I feel a little empty, feel like I’ve said goodbye to an old friend. I’ve been tempted to go back and read Books 1 and 2 again. It’s been so long that I can’t recall them in detail.  I drive 70 miles from Atlanta to north Georgia where I teach each day. It makes for great book time. Listening to Books 3-6  was a joy, a companion in my ear for so many hours over the last year. Edoardo Ballerini does an amazing job narrating.  My Struggle—all six volumes—is worth the time. I wouldn’t skip any of them, not a page. I wrote about Joyce’s Ulysses back in the summer, and I considered why it’s a difficult read. That book, at the sentence level, with its alien interior, and mashed up narratives is just, flat-out, a work-out to read. This is not the case with Knausgaard’s novels. Instead, sheer mass is in play here. My office mate, Justin, just read Book 1: he loved it, thought it brilliant, but he’s hesitant to dive into the whole series. He had to “resist” jumping right into Book 2. I know what he means. There is something electric, haunting, and frenetic in the first couple of books.  Sometimes this day-to-day focus makes for some slower passages—I wonder how many cigraettes and cups of coffee are consumed in the course of My Struggle? But this focus on the daily circuit—one that we each run—also lends to the force of his novels. Sections would seem like they were drifting, or without real direction and then hundreds of pages would come to a head in one shattering moment. Much of Knausgaard’s childhood memories seem banal, every day, without significance, but then you see how much his father really hurt him, how much his father warped him. And ultimately, what are we but our day-to-day? We are those moment to moment people who become our habits.  I try to explain to people, how these six volumes feel to read. One thing: I think I know more about Knausgaard than many of my own family members. I mentioned this to Justin and he mentioned that our outer lives are often sanitized, cleaned-up for social media presentation. I agree, and here, I think Knausgaard excels. Of course, he’s not shown us EVERYTHING, but he has shown us much of his core, his fears, his shame, his unending self-censorship in day-to day life. I have spent 3600 pages or 100 plus hours listening to this man talk about himself, his world, his desires: Knausgaard as boy, as teen, as twenty, as a father, as a 40 year old looking back. My Struggle ends, really, in the middle of life, not a true ending at all. The struggle isn’t over.  Book 6 features a 400 page essay about Hitler growing up in pre-WWII Europe and it’s the only part of Book 6 that made any sense to me, was organized and concise. Book 6 is long, at well over a thousand pages. It’s the only volume that I thought needed serious editing or trimming. But, but, but the essay on Hitler is brilliant. If you only read that, it’s worth picking up 6. Knausgaard attempts the impossible: to humanize Adolf Hitler, to portray the man as a person who should be “hated for what he did, not who he was.” Knausgaard implies several parallels between himself and young Hitler: both were struggling artists, both hated bourgeois culture, both had strained relationships with their fathers, both went from small towns to city life. But, these are where the similarities end. Knausgaard cites a slow, meticulous, biography on Hitler. It’s a brilliant piece of writing in the middle of Book 6. How did a struggling artist, a WWI vet, and nobody rise to ultimate power? and in that role as German leader, orchestrate the Holocaust?  How do we still view this person as a human and not just a monster? How do you humanize Hitler? How do we live in the shadow of the early 20th century? For Knausgaard, this moment in history is a critical moment, a moment where society shifted towards the modern, the fragmented; it was the world he grew up in in 1970’s Norway. A Norway only 30 years removed from WWII, still embedded with abandoned Nazi coastal bunkers.  Ultimately, the struggle, for Knausgaard, is one with his father, the ghost, the ever present authoritarian spirit. Knausgaard makes some interesting points about fathers and sons in Ulysses, Hamlet, and the New Testament. All feature sons and fathers at odds, or in utterly different roles. Knausgaard was physically abused by his father, but the daily emotional abuse is what left a decades long shadow over him. He can never truly overcome the legacy of his father, the alcoholism, the terrible death, but the novels are a form of catharsis at least, a way for Knausgaard to push back against his father’s control. What is a life worth living? For Knausgaard, it’s writing, it’s about being present, it’s being close to his family, even when they are driving him mad, it’s saying to the world: I’m going to tell this story, even if I must pay dearly for it. At the core of this novel is a question: What is authentic? Can any fiction be worthwhile? I’ve thought about this for the last couple years as I seek my own writing identity. What is worth writing about really asks, what is worth living with, thinking about, for we are what we write. The stories we retell become new and alive to us. For Knausgaard, at least with My Struggle, he could no longer write fiction; he had to deal with his own narrative. This shift closer to non-fiction, this fusion of autobiography and novel is wonderful to read and cost Knausgaard much, perhaps, as he concludes Book 6, too much.

Digital Humanities Research Hub Seminar | School of Advanced Study;"6 May 2021 | Locating a National Collection through Audience ResearchGethin Rees and Valeria Vitale (British Library) Locating a National Collection (LaNC) aims to help cultural heritage organisations to use location data—such as where objects were made and used or the places they depict and describe—to connect collections and engage audiences. Location-based interfaces such as web maps offer opportunities to open up collections to new audiences and uses. This presentation explores how LaNC is using audience research methods including surveys and focus groups to inform geospatial data structures and interface design.Catch up on the session now. 20 May 2021 | Editorial Transformations and Minimal Computing at the Melville Electronic LibraryChristopher Ohge (SAS) The Melville Electronic Library was established in 2009 after receiving a digital humanities start-up grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and then received additional NEH scholarly editions grants until 2017. But when the project had exhausted its grant funding, it still had much editorial work to do, so the editorial team worked with its technical partners to transform the entire project into a static site using minimal computing principles. This seminar will outline the transformations undertaken by the project, and how the minimal approach revealed the affordances of sustainable computing for humanities projects.Catch up on the session now. 3 June: 2021 | Teaching Digital Approaches to Cultural Heritage as an International CollaborationGabriel Bodard (SAS) For the past several years I have been teaching two modules on digital approaches to the ancient world for SAS students and the London intercollegiate classics MA programme. One of these modules focuses on text and language (“Classics” proper) and the other on Cultural Heritage, a mix of imaging, geographical information, and other approaches to the study of historical material culture. This second module, which is titled “Digital Approaches to Cultural Heritage,” uses the collaborative and international Sunoikisis Digital Classics programme, which enables us to bring a range of perspectives and expertise into both the design and the delivery of content. This presentation will discuss the mix of technical, practical, and theoretical approaches that students engage with in this programme, and the invaluable contributions from scholars and practitioners in archaeology, heritage institutions, art law and other fields, that have brought to the syllabus topics around intellectual property, ethics, questions of representation, cultural norms and sensitivities, and debates around restitution and repatriation of heritage in the digital realm.Catch up on the session now. 17 June 2021 | “Stop, collaborate and listen”: Lessons on interdisciplinary collaboration from the Living with Machines ProjectRuth Ahnert (QMUL) The Living with Machines project, based at The Alan Turing Institute, brings together historians, data scientists, curators and library professionals, computational linguists, and digital humanists, to examine the human impact of the coming of the machine age (c.1780-1920). This paper will discuss what it is like collaborating on such an unusually large and interdisciplinary project. It will discuss in particular the challenges of creating a shared vision and programme of research that respects the different research and work cultures of its members, and their expectations about how to work, what constitutes a meaningful outcome, and how that should be disseminated.Catch up on the session now. 1 July 2021 | Researching Social Media in the Digital HumanitiesNaomi Wells (SAS), Rhiannon Lewis (SAS) & Nayana Dhavan (KCL). Social media research is often associated with (new) media and communications studies, which have to a large extent laid the theoretical and methodological foundations for such research. Recent years have, however, seen an increasing interest from those working within DH, as reflected in conferences and publications in the field. This is connected to the growth of the field of internet history and the consolidation of born-digital archives in the museums and heritage sector. It is also a result of the increasing need for those who study contemporary cultural practices and texts in the humanities to address the undeniable role of social media in contemporary life. While there have been attempts to explore the intersections between media studies and digital humanities (see e.g. Sayers 2020), critical questions remain about what digital humanists bring to the study of social media and how social media research connects with more established approaches within DH. Including short presentations on current social media research in DH, this seminar will invite discussion on these ongoing questions concerning the role of social media research in the field.Catch up on the session now. © School of Advanced Study 2020

Fundraiser for David Noonan by Jessica Noonan : OK, Copernicus Productions needs your support!;"Your donation matters http://7h34c4d3my0f473x4ndr14.org
 I am Jess Noonan, founder and executive director of OK, Copernicus Productions & Management, Inc. This business is my only job, my husband and I pour every ounce of energy we have into building a business that someone with my disabilities would not only create and organize, but build it’s inclusive and charitable structure than the ground up. Both my husbands VA and disability has been cut to below $18,000 a year while I’m trying to generate income while changing my community for the better. Please help us, we have sacrificed everything for a system that has never had our back in return. We can to change the world away from the painful suffering distracted by more discomfort believing we deserve this because of fate or power or money. Not my company, not my business, we want those who invest in positivity for all sentient life and we need you help. Our company is so small we are all volunteers hoping for a better life, one we’re creating, please help us build it.We are located downtown, very close to Hood College, where I once studied and ran the philosophy club, along with a few other colleges we could interview interns from to help grow our brand new nonprofit organization and social club dedicated to the enrichment and preservation of the arts and humanities though technology. Digital humanities advancements that have made sharing this type of hands on studio education much more accessible, especially with safety concerns due to COVID-19, to offer apprenticeship through the in-house/remote hybrid structure of our organization’s platforms (zoom, google, YouTube, Anchor.fm, Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, Twitch.tv, Pinterest, Wordpress, Medium, TikTok, Snapchat, MS Teams and growing to advance cyber art, music, and humanities educational and entertainment pursuits) as a teaching tool open to everyone we can possibly work with and embark knowledge in many cases alongside our permanent staff and peers in the social club who attend for their art affinities and a sense of community. We need promotional/art supplies (we do our own art and printing in house, but need supplies to produce merchandise for fundraising and showing support), we need to cover our server and subscription fees for the first year. Material upgrades to the studio equipment, especially hardware and software that is very itemized, we will choose to host fundraising for video/music/production equipment as a separate fundraiser to be pitched to and approved by Kickstarter’s policies. Stay tuned once research and development is given the green light we will embark on that next crucial project to take us hopefully to vocaloid and holographic tech with more education and technology becoming more affordable with modern advances.We want to compensate the two interns we select with a nice stipend and an amazing experience in multimedia content creation, networking, participation in peer based outreach programs, trying out and gaining proficiency in multiple multimedia skills, soft skills and a new view of cyber etiquette and ethics are strongly upheld in the workplace for professionalism, art/tech/music/philosophy lectures and tutoring are available to give and receive experience in, book drives, newsletter creation, plus many other perks of joining Team Copernicus for our big debut in the streaming/social networking edutainment demographics…Hopefully many more innovations will come from our studio offering hands on opportunities for local humanist students trying to find their preferred medium to express their voice in the 21st century!Learning is supposed to be a beautiful, adventurous journey of wonderment, growth, and appreciation. Help us use tech for good, bringing back culture and discourse and self improvement during these inherently trying times. Help us bring hope and perhaps innovative new solutions in education and community outreach. Thank you!https://youtu.be/YelZy7LPWuE

IDRH Welcomes the 2020 Digital Humanities Fellows | Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities;"LAWRENCE — The Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Kansas has announced the newly selected fellows for the 2020-2021 program focusing on the ethics, politics and techniques of digital storytelling. From a competitive pool of applicants of KU faculty, staff and graduate students, the 10 fellows were selected to join IDRH in a yearlong, institutionwide conversation about issues in the digital humanities. Each fellow will participate in working groups twice a semester (virtual or in-person), attend presentations by the IDRH colloquium speakers and commit to workshopping digital humanities projects, which they will present at a final Digital Humanities Fellows Symposium. The fellows will be paid a $,1000 stipend. L. Marie Avila, undergraduate engagement librarian for KU Libraries, will use digital storytelling in support of Indigenous ways of knowing. She wants to share the compelling theme of self-determination and sovereignty within Indigenous librarianship. Avila will apply Indigenous research methods in order to meet the needs of this project and ethically center Indigenous librarians and information specialists from historically underrepresented groups. This research project aims to provide a decolonized version of librarianship using digital storytelling techniques that she will learn during this fellowship. Avila plans to make a map-based visualization that demonstrates the outreach and intersections of transferable knowledge among Tribal College and University (TCUs) librarians by utilizing the landscape to capture the localities of TCUs, ALA-accredited library and information science graduate programs, and state flagship universities. Avila's motivations for this project include the scholarship on the Classification Bias in the organization of American Indian materials in libraries, data about librarians’ demographics, and the retention and graduation rates of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in higher education. Ignacio Carvajal, assistant professor in the Department of Spanish & Portuguese, looks forward to exploring the relationship between digital pedagogy and digital humanities and building on his work designing online educational materials in K’iche’ — a Mayan language spoken in the highlands of Guatemala. As a long-term goal, he hopes to create a digital repository of materials not only for K’iche’ language learning but also for the exploration of literature, art and thought arising from Iximulew and the rest of Central America. Carvajal plans to create a first batch of K’iche’ language materials anchored around the story of Manuela Petronila Tahay Tzaj, K’iche’ teacher and assistant instructor in K’iche’ lessons at KU. The lessons will center Tzaj's experience as an educator and provide a reflection on contemporary K’iche’ language and culture in Nahualá and Iximulew at large. Bobby Cervantes is a doctoral candidate in the Department of American Studies at the University of Kansas. His research asks how the working poor’s struggles, ideologies, and cultures expose the pervasive influence of class exploitation on the nation’s development into an industrial and global capitalist hegemon. He is at work on his dissertation, “Las Colonias: The Housing of Poverty in Modern America,” which historicizes the more than 2,000 rural, unincorporated communities (las colonias) on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border where poor families have lived for more than a half-century. Using property records, media accounts, oral histories and government archives, his dissertation argues that the colonia project has formed a new transnational territory of poverty. A Texas native and journalist, Cervantes has published his work in the Houston Chronicle, Texas Monthly and Aztlán: A Journal of Chicano Studies. Germaine Halegoua, associate professor in the Department of Film & Media Studies, is in the process of researching and writing a manuscript about dark fiber networks in the U.S. that intervenes in pressing debates about digital divides, corporate models of internet architecture and ownership, and offers new insight into the ideologies and social decisions that structure internet connectivity. Dark fiber networks are fiber-optic networks purposefully constructed as inactive and are practically invisible to urban and rural populations—not only are they dormant and hidden under layers of concrete or dirt, but their exact locations are also obfuscated. Her research consists of two parts that rely on collecting and analyzing digital stories: tracking the network itself and locating traces of the social decisions and policies surrounding network installation, use and non-use. In addition to a conventional manuscript, she plans to create an interactive map embedded with interview segments, infrastructure design blueprints and annotated photographs of dark fiber routes and access points to accompany the book. Ayesha Hardison is an associate professor in the departments of English and Women, Gender & Sexuality Studies. Her current book project, ""Specters of Black Freedom Struggles,"" explores the ways late 20th- and early 21st-century African American writers and artists wrestle with the legacy of black freedom struggles in their representations of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. Examining portrayals of these campaigns in fiction, film and material culture, Hardison plots a cultural history of this era by analyzing writers’ and artists’ engagement with historical memory. In turn, her project considers how contemporary cultural narratives shape our historical memory of the period. Narratives about this era continue to evolve as the nation commemorates the anniversaries of notable moments in black freedom struggles. Moreover, recent events, including Black Lives Matter protests, renew this history’s significance by exposing its present-day resonances. Hardison aims to deepen our appreciation of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements by unpacking the conceits embedded in depictions of this history as well as analyze the various narrative techniques used to codify it. She intends to convey the importance of these historical representations with the methods and tools the digital humanities offer for twenty-first-century storytelling. Shane Lynch is a doctoral student in American studies. His work, tentatively titled ""Gila River Generations,"" is a pixel graphic video game that incorporates the traditional stories of the O’odham and Pee Posh peoples of central Arizona. The game will include both culture’s creation stories and languages. The game will be done both in 2D - ¾ overhead view and in scrolling screens (up and side scrolling). Lynch will combine elements of puzzles, RPGs, platformers, hack and slash elements along with cut scenes to the combined stories. The game will have text that will be written in O’odham, Pee Posh and English with plans to expand the language aspect of the game. The game is currently in development with plans to use Unity to produce the game. The goal is to create a learning experience while engaging in traditional storytelling through video games. ""Gila River Generations"" is a continuation of culture through digital pixel graphics. Joey Orr is the Andrew W. Mellon Curator for Research at the Spencer Museum of Art. Each academic year, the Integrated Arts Research Initiative (IARI) at the Spencer Museum of Art organizes an inquiry that is broadly conceived to encompass a large spectrum of practitioners across the sciences and humanities. The 2020-2021 inquiry, “Tending to the Body,” looks at humanities and artistic-based contributions to our understanding of the human body. Because of COVID-19, this year’s inquiry will take a digital form to support interdisciplinary discussions when more traditional ways of gathering pose public health risks. This new digital storytelling format will need to weave together contributions from each member of the inquiry’s cohort. These contributions will take forms as varied as text, audio, and still and moving images. It must also explore and be sensitive to all of the many urgent contemporary issues that intersect with ideas about the body, including race and health equity. With a digital storytelling tool developed for each year’s inquiry, future contributors will be exposed to each other’s work and explore connections in advance of gatherings, lending a new level of depth and consideration to our exchanges. Hyunjin Seo is an associate professor in the William Allen White School of Journalism & Mass Communications. She will examine how to incorporate digital storytelling into her project on online privacy and security for women recently released from jails and prisons. She will adopt a co-design approach working closely with women in reentry currently residing in Kansas and Missouri throughout the process and centering their interests and needs in building related content. Women in reentry will learn and use digital storytelling techniques to tell their own accounts of challenges and opportunities related to online privacy and security. These will then be used to help other women in reentry and soon-to-be-released women learn about issues related to online privacy and security. Properly addressing ethical issues is critical to developing and implementing this project. Therefore, ethics of digital storytelling will be at the core of her fellowship project. Systematic research based on direct interactions with this population is essential to developing a program tailored for these women’s particular needs and interests. The proposed project will help them navigate digital spaces in a more secure manner. Erin Wolfe is a metadata librarian at KU Libraries. The goal of Wolfe's project is to provide a case study on a community’s response to a global situation by analyzing local newspapers’ coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a variety of natural language processing approaches on two Douglas County newspapers, this project will look at the ways in which trends and patterns develop and shift over time through the topics and language used in articles published to the web and what this might tell us. One aim is to be able to contrast these results with similar projects being conducted on a national scale to highlight differences and overlap in themes and coverage between these scopes. A more challenging aspect of this project would be to identify and explore which topics and perspectives are represented and which are lacking from these local published accounts, which may help to bring attention to underrepresented voices in our community. James Yeku is an assistant professor in the Department of African & African-American Studies. Digital Nollywood uses Omeka to collect and exhibit movie posters from what is now considered old Nollywood in Nigeria. In terms of output, Nollywood is the second-largest film industry in the world. Old Nollywood posters, mostly from 1992 to the early 2000s, provide important historical perspectives on the evolution of film in Nigeria. As the most popular film industry in Africa and the African Diaspora, Nollywood serves as a platform for telling the African story, highlighting how the film medium can embody the values, meanings and identities of groups and communities. The stakes of Digital Nollywood consist in the reconstruction of the history of Nollywood through a significant aspect of its production that is rarely discussed in the scholarly community on African cultural productions. A digital archive of film posters on Nollywood enables the preservation and historical documentation of Nollywood’s paratexts, which can be beneficial for scholars and students of film history Nigeria.

Visualization and Interpretation | The MIT Press;"MIT Press Direct is a distinctive collection of influential MIT Press books curated for scholars and libraries worldwide. More Info >   MIT Press began publishing journals in 1970 with the first volumes of Linguistic Inquiry and the Journal of Interdisciplinary History. Today we publish over 30 titles in the arts and humanities, social sciences, and science and technology. MIT Press Journals By Johanna Drucker “Graphs, charts and maps are often considered to be objective expressions of facts. But the fact is that they are complex texts, demanding interpretation. That is why this is an important book, building a solid bridge between the evolving field of data visualization and the long humanistic tradition of critical interpretation.” Martin Engebretsen Professor in the Department of Nordic and Media Studies at the University of Agder; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society Mouseover for Online Attention Data An analysis of visual epistemology in the digital humanities, with attention to the need for interpretive digital tools within humanities contexts. In the several decades since humanists have taken up computational tools, they have borrowed many techniques from other fields, including visualization methods to create charts, graphs, diagrams, maps, and other graphic displays of information. But are these visualizations actually adequate for the interpretive approach that distinguishes much of the work in the humanities? Information visualization, as practiced today, lacks the interpretive frameworks required for humanities-oriented methodologies. In this book, Johanna Drucker continues her interrogation of visual epistemology in the digital humanities, reorienting the creation of digital tools within humanities contexts.  Drucker examines various theoretical understandings of visual images and their relation to knowledge and how the specifics of the graphical are to be engaged directly as a primary means of knowledge production for digital humanities. She draws on ideas from aesthetics, critical theory, and formal study of graphical systems, addressing them within the specific framework of computational and digital activity as they apply to digital humanities. Finally, she presents a series of standard problems in visualization for the humanities (including time/temporality, space/spatial relations, and data analysis), posing the investigation in terms of innovative graphical systems informed by probabilistic critical hermeneutics. She concludes with a brief sketch of discovery tools as an additional interface into which modeling can be worked.  “Graphs, charts and maps are often considered to be objective expressions of facts. But the fact is that they are complex texts, demanding interpretation. That is why this is an important book, building a solid bridge between the evolving field of data visualization and the long humanistic tradition of critical interpretation.” Martin Engebretsen Professor in the Department of Nordic and Media Studies at the University of Agder; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society “How can the humanities benefit from information visualization and how can visualization be more suited to the purposes of the humanities? Johanna Drucker expertly confronts these questions in her excellent new book Visualization and Interpretation. Ultimately, this timely and welcome book is about making visualization more human.” Helen Kennedy Professor of Digital Society at the University of Sheffield; coeditor of Data Visualization in Society “Drucker's new book is a very important and truly original contribution to digital humanities, data visualization, and data science fields. She develops a new paradigm for thinking about relations between cultural artifacts, knowledge, interpretation, data and visualization. The ideas presented in this book will change how we think about culture, data and display and the book itself will remain the key reference in decades to come.” Lev Manovich Presidential Professor, The Graduate Center, City University of New York; author of The Language of New Media and Cultural Analytics  Anne Burdick,  Johanna Drucker,  Peter Lunenfeld,  Todd Presner,   and Schnapp Jeffrey

‘the creatures He made’: Animal Welfare in Salvation Army History | The Salvation Army;"‘the creatures He made’: Animal Welfare in Salvation Army History References to the importance attached to animal welfare in the early history of The Salvation Army regularly crop up on this blog. Treating animals with kindness and humanity is often presented as an important aspect of a Christian life. Our Director Steven has written about how members of the Band of Love, the Salvation Army-run children’s temperance organisation, promised to ‘try to love all and be kind to Animals’. There were economic considerations to Salvationists’ attitudes to animals and animal products as well, however. Our Archives Assistant Chloe quotes an officer’s advice on caring for working horses in the waste paper works of the Men’s Social Work, which is strongly linked to the fact that horses were a valuable resource. In both Chloe’s post on Katie Booth’s old coat and my own on vegetarianism, there is a sense that the use of animal products, including fur and meat, was discouraged for Salvationists because these products were expensive, and saving on them left more funds to donate back to The Army. Nevertheless, Salvation Army institutions such as Hadleigh Farm did produce animal products for the market. The early Salvation Army’s attitude to animals seems to be closely related to Genesis 1:28, in which humans were given stewardship over other animals – but any use made of animals should be respectful and free from abuse or mistreatment. The wellbeing of animals and people was clearly seen as interconnected. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century people and working animals relied on each other, and the best results would be achieved if both could have a long and healthy working life. This idea informs initiatives such as the so-called Cab Horse Charter that General William Booth invoked in his 1890 blueprint of The Salvation Army’s social work, In Darkest England and the Way Out. The welfare of London cab horses had become a popular cause following the publication of Black Beauty, Anna Sewell’s 1877 novel exploring the lives of working horses. Booth referred to the benchmark for care given to cab horses – ‘When he is down he is helped up, and while he lives he has food, shelter and work’ – to argue that people should be entitled to the same. While The Salvation Army remained focused on people, animal welfare is a recurring theme in The Darkest England Gazette, the weekly magazine dedicated to the Social Work between 1893 and 1894. In the early issues references to animal welfare and animal suffering frequently appear in the short fragments of news and remarks that filled up leftover column space. These might, for instance, pick up on reports in other publications of blood sports or mistreatment of working animals and present these as examples of condemnable cruelty. In later issues reports also start to appear on the importance of animals in The Salvation Army’s agrarian ventures. One key contemporary animal rights cause that found its way into The Darkest England Gazette is the high-profile issue of vivisection. Surgical experimentation on living animals was widespread in medical research and training during the period, and activists from many different backgrounds campaigned for it to be banned. The Booth family were opposed to vivisection and corresponded with anti-vivisection campaigners. Between 7 April and 9 June 1894, The Darkest England Gazette included a series of contributions from Edith Carrington (1853–1929), a prominent anti-vivisectionist who seems to have had no other connection with The Salvation Army. Her contributions are clearly geared towards The Salvation Army’s Christian ethics, however, and Christian responsibility is central to her arguments. According to Carrington, caring for animals is a Christian duty signifying mercy and humility. Her contributions follow three key tenets: the un-Christian attitude of vivisectors, practising Christians’ resilience in the face of suffering and death, and the dangers of breaking down moral barriers to cruelty. Evoking Genesis, she argues: [Animals] were delivered into our hands for food, clothing, and help; but never in order that their beautiful forms, the work of God’s fingers, within and without, should be mangled, burnt, scalded, bruised, torn to pieces, to satisfy the curiosity of a barbarous surgeon as to how the marvellous thing was made. In other words, all animals are God’s creation, which humans are not entitled to violate. It follows that those who practise or defend vivisection act in an un-Christian way. Carrington states: The vivisector’s religion may rightly be described as Materialism, or a kind of worship of the body, because he seeks to obtain for himself or others a long life, and freedom from pain, no matter at what risk to the soul. […] Now, those who have a spiritual religion know that pain is not altogether a real evil, to be shirked at any price. […] If we seek to get rid of pain, or even death, by means of a sinful action, we murder the soul, and lay up eternal misery for that! Elsewhere, she also argues that Christians derive from their faith the strength to endure suffering, so that they ‘have no need to seek to shuffle pain off upon beings less able to bear it than themselves’. Rather than ultimately improving people’s lives, then, this kind of experimentation in fact causes both individuals and society to deteriorate morally by devaluing the very concept of care. Carrington asks: ‘Can young men, who begin life by trampling on every merciful instinct, be fit for the profession of healers in after years?’ As these doctors’ moral instincts were worn away, she suggests, they would become less respectful of other life, and even become tempted to treat human bodies as further experimental material, rather than seeking to heal them. In an article entitled ‘Human Vivisection’ she states: ‘From the helpless dog to the defenceless baby is one step, the next leads to the almost equally feeble invalid mother…’ This argument asks for animals to be taken into account in The Salvation Army’s understanding that no human life is worth less than any other. If it is clearly no more acceptable to experiment on an infant than on its exhausted mother, Carrington asks, why should it be permissible to practise the same cruelty on a dog or any other species? In the early Salvation Army, caring for animal welfare was considered part and parcel of a Christian’s duties. Although the use of animal labour and products was not prohibited, it was felt to be important for a number of reasons to make use of animals in ethical ways. Failure to do so was associated not only with social and economic irresponsibility – as by hurting valuable working horses, for instance – but also, as Carrington shows, posed a direct danger to one’s own spiritual welfare. By hurting animals, people were likely to end up hurting themselves as well as others in the long run.

Sage Advice on Digital Humanities – JESociety;"The Jonathan Edwards Society Here’s some great advice regarding Digital Humanities from a 2017 interview with Ken Minkema: Continue to acquaint yourselves with the latest advances and applications in digital humanities. I was a member of that transitional generation that, in less than two decades, went from paper and pen to manual typewriter to electric typewriter to computer, so understanding the digital world did not come naturally. But now it is not only vital for superior teaching and personal research, but provides the basis for being flexible and adaptable. With this foundation, one can teach in various settings whether onsite or online, or work in public history capacities, in libraries and museums, in historical editions, in advocacy, in philanthropy, and so forth. I would add to this — be “flexible and adaptable” and able to create code that solves problems and eases entry for readers into large and complex corpora like The Works of Jonathan Edwards and Early Church Fathers. The video below demonstrates the Quickview feature of Visual Edwards software and how one can start exploring a single passage of WJE and extend it to the larger corpus (and even compare with Augustine and the other Fathers).

Can Digital Humanities Be Informed by Bioinformatics? Visualising Passim Data for Multiple-Book Relationships | The Aga Khan University News;​ As KITAB’s research has shown, passim is an incredibly powerful tool for answering a variety of questions about book history and history in general. The algorithm produces a huge amount of data, which we can utilise in our research in many ways. At present, we typically investigate text reuse in the corpus at the level of relationships between pairs of books. That is, we look at statistics that tell us what percentage of one book is reused in another and we visualise alignments between two books. This approach is great for understanding how two books are related, but once we start comparing multiple books these approaches become quite cumbersome. To note a couple of examples: what if we wanted to investigate how one particular book was disseminated across tens or even hundreds of later works? Or, what if we wanted to know about how one particular unit of information (perhaps a narrative about a major event) circulated throughout our corpus? To help deal with these kinds of questions the team has been developing new applications for understanding multiple-book relationships. In this blog, I will take the opportunity to introduce some of the applications under development. To do so, however, this requires a short tangent on bioinformatics. The computational analysis of text reuse has developed and advanced alongside that of genomics. This is a fact noted explicitly by David Smith, when he acknowledges that passim utilises the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm, which is also used in the analysis of genes.[1] Text reuse and genetics are both concerned with problems in sequencing. Put simply, when biologists wish to analyse genes, they convert genetic material into a sequence of letters (A, C, G, T), each of which represent a chemical nucleotide base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine). Three-letter words termed ‘codons’ specify the amino acids that are used by the body to build proteins.[2] There are also ‘stop codons’ that mark the end of the sequence. Similarities in sequences of letters between parts of a chromosome or with other chromosomes, or even similarities between the genomes of different animals, might indicate (for example) similar biological functionality. In short, important biological questions can be resolved by identifying similar sequences of letters and alignment algorithms like Smith-Waterman are used to undertake this task.​ Read more​ Mathew Barber​​ Research Associate for KITAB at AKU-ISMC.

He is interested in particular in history writing under the Fatimids in Egypt, the preservation and dispersal of Fatimid-era historical texts, and what this preservation (or lack thereof) means for how later historians viewed and understood the Egyptian past. He is concerned with answering such research questions using a combination of digital and traditional methods, in particular using computational text reuse detection to identify so-called 'lost' texts.​​​​​ ​ As KITAB’s research has shown, passim is an incredibly powerful tool for answering a variety of questions about book history and history in general.

Moving On (again) | cradledincaricature;"In September 2001 I arrived at the University of Southampton to study a degree in History. In September 2021 I’ll be returning to Southampton to take up the post of Director of Digital Humanities. This means leaving where I am. I’ve had such a wonderful time at the University of Sussex and the Sussex Humanities Lab. I’ve worked with some inspiring colleagues and students, collaborated on some fab projects, and made some good friends. Sussex has also indulged my uneasy relationship with Digital Humanities. Because whilst I’ve published in DHy places, run DHy things, gone to DH conferences, written DHy work, and read DHy books, I have rarely described the Sussex Humanities Lab as a place that does (only) Digital Humanities. Yes, we’ve built a community of expertise around technology’s role in shaping culture, society and the environment. And yes, we use technological tools to undertake research within the arts, humanities and social sciences. But our work ranges from AI to climate justice, ecoacoustics to automated writing, intersectional feminism to research infrastructures, critical heritage to robot opera. And whilst, when it is tactically useful to do so, we’ve described all that as ‘Digital Humanities’, more often than not we’ve described it in disciplinary terms, as interventions in practices and traditions that we’ve sought to understand, to integrate into, and to bridge between. Indeed, when Sharon Webb (my fabby amazing co-conspirator at Sussex who I’ll miss a lot!) and I won an award for working DHy things into our undergraduate History curriculum, we did so not because we taught our students DH, but because we empowered (I hope!) our students to consider how digital transformations have changed the conditions in which they do history and the approaches they can take to studying the past. They had after all, as I had 20 years earlier, come to uni to study History. Over recent days I’ve been picking through Adam Crymble’s Technology and the Historian: Transformations and the Digital Age. Adam is another person I’m proud to consider a co-conspirator, and I’ve had the pleasure of glimpsing at this book during its gestation. I believe we really need his historicisation of recent historical practice. And I’m pleased I’m not alone in welcoming his key argument: that we need stop worrying about what ‘digital history’ is, and focus instead on the actual work historians are and have been doing. And so when my eyes landed on Adam’s introduction to his Glossary, where he notes that it’s presence is intended to encourage ‘practitioners to use more precise language when discussing “digital” or “digital history” work’, I kinda whooped, both with my History hat on, and because I have similar feelings about the use of the term ‘Digital Humanities’. Technology and the Historian resonates then with my longstanding discomfort with DH as a label for the work I get involved in, because I don’t think of it as DH, I think of it as history that leans on methods from computational lingustics, or digital forensics as archival practice and advocacy, or critical making that happens to involve building a website, digitising some stuff, and figuring out a bunch of metadata harmonisation, or highly collaborative action research that draws on digital preservation in seeking to create positive change in people’s lives. Despite this longstanding discomfort with DH, I’m soon to become a Director of Digital Humanities (the third time I’ve had ‘digital’ in my job title, for anyone who is counting). I am genuinely excited by this, partly because in my interview I don’t feel I held back on that discomfort (and they still wanted me!), and partly because Southampton has some great infrastructure, people (some of whom taught me!), research software expertise,  and ambitions. But I’m also excited because where once questions like ‘what is Digital Humanities’ made me squirm and bumble or – on a bad day – sigh or go defensive, I feel that I’ve now reached a place where I’m comfortable in my uncomfortable DH skin, where I can turn around a question on the definition of DH to ask people why they are interested in knowing what DH is as a route to figuring out what DHy things can do for them and their work. I wouldn’t have got to this place of comfortable discomfort without my (nearly) 6 years at Sussex, without colleagues like Tim (especially, Tim), Sharon (ditto), Amelia (ditto), Caroline, Jane, Alice, Nicola, Claire, Jo, Rachel, Andrew, Lucy, Mariz, Joanne, Vinita, Flora, Jo, Alex, JoAnn, Freja, Suzanne, Natasha, Laura, David, Ben, Louise, Jake, Tom, Beatrice, Amy, Chris, Alex, Liam, Ilona, Jim, Clive, Kate, Anna-Maria, Ahmed, and many, many, many more.

Old Books and New Technologies: Medieval Books and the Digital Humanities in the Low Countries • KBR;"Discover what being a woman actually meant in our regions at the end of the 15th century. From the Virgin Mary to mermaids. Clemens Neudecker discusses the achievements and experiences of the QURATOR project at the Berlin State Library for document layout analysis. Discover the sound of Toots Thielemans at this experiential exhibition in which sound and music play the leading role. On 6 and 7 May 2021, KBR, in partnership with the Campus Condorcet of Paris, the National Library of Luxembourg, the KB national library of the Netherlands, the universities of Ghent, Leuven, Liège, Mons and Namur, and the Vlaamse Erfgoedbibliotheken, will be holding an international conference on medieval books and the digital humanities in the Low Countries. It will bring together representatives from libraries, museums, archives with researchers interested in the ‘medieval book  and new technologies’. Particular emphasis will be placed on the methodological dimension of the use of digital humanities. Working languages will be English, Dutch, and French.   Over the course of the Middle Ages, what was called the Low Countries developed an original written culture. It is known to us through sources in Latin, in Middle Dutch and in Old and Middle French. At first centred in the Benedictine and Cistercian abbeys of Egmond and Friesland in the North or the Dunes, Ghent and the closely connected chain of Lobbes – Gembloux – Liège in the South, it increasingly became a town phenomenon following the development of the largest and most dense urban conglomeration in the European Middle Ages both with large towns like Ghent, Bruges, Tournai, Liège, Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, Utrecht and a series of smaller cities scattered over the area, all with their convents, and, consequently, books. In the 15th century, the production of luxury manuscripts for the Burgundian court and its environment flourished in Bruges, Ghent, Oudenaarde, Brussels and Tournai, which gave rise to the development of an important pictorial culture. At the same time, the presence of towns, cathedrals and chapters all over the area gave rise to the rise of the famous French-Flemish school of polyphony, the works of which often have come down to us in beautifully executed manuscripts. The urban character of the region in the later Middle Ages was essential in the development and expansion of such phenomena as the Devotio moderna or early Humanism. When the latter was essential in the spread of Latin schools and the amount of 15th-century editions of classical Latin authors in the IJssel region, the first found its expression in a proper network of convents and libraries, which is highlighted by the ‘Red Cloister Register’, the famous collective catalogue compiled in the early sixteenth century. All this produced an important heritage of medieval books, manuscripts and incunabula as well as the sources for their history up to the eighteenth century (old library inventories, pre-modern bio-bibliographical sources, accounts of literary journeys, etc.).   The essential part of what has been preserved of this important heritage has fortunately survived in the libraries and manuscript collections of our regions. Over the last few years, important survey and recovery projects have been started in what has become the Benelux: CICweb.be for the French-speaking institutions of Wallonia and Brussels, Medieval Manuscripts in Dutch Collections for the Kingdom of The Netherlands and Medieval Manuscripts in Flemish Collections for Flanders. However, not all the heritage collections have been identified or explored, especially in the private and ecclesiastical libraries. Moreover, not all the pre-modern sources useful for the study of this written heritage have yet been identified, surveyed or edited. To facilitate these scholarly activities, we must call on information technologies and particularly on digital humanities for inventory, research, preservation and enhancement of this heritage. Relevant technologies include Initiatives, such as the Sanderus electronicus, the electronic edition of the Bibliotheca Belgica Manuscripta project, have already been underway for years. However, all these initiatives have not yet necessarily been surveyed, and they are still not all accessible from a central point of information. Moreover, many manuscripts and the relevant sources that document their history are still poorly known to scholars working in this field. It therefore seems timely and opportune to make an assessment of the initiatives and to establish a research community around the written heritage of the historical Low Countries and the application of digital humanities to this field. An ‘observatory of written heritage’, comparable to Biblissima and in close collaboration with this pioneering French portal in the field, would be a good approach to creating a synergy between keepers of the historical collections, expert librarians, academic teachers and written heritage conservators.   Registration is now closed.

“6da0056908e47c275a3058bab145e5ad” in “Preface” on Liverpool University Press Digital Collaboration Hub;Preface Keith Michael Baker I offer this preface in all modesty. I’ve compiled no databases, created no programmes. At best, I’ve benefited as an early adopter of some of the more manageable (but no less powerful) tools developed in the digital humanities. At worst, I’m a Zelig of the digital humanities world who has happened to show up in some of the right places, and at some of the right times, to observe its progress. From either of these perspectives I invite Enlightenment scholars and other readers to marvel at the ambition, creativity, ingenuity, persistence and sheer joy of discovery apparent in the pages that follow. They show scholarship in perpetual motion. They open avenues and suggest opportunities for humanistic enquiry that can pique our curiosity, empower our research, enrich our understanding and amplify our knowledge in remarkable and often unexpected ways. When I started my doctoral work decades ago, the Journal of the history of ideas had been publishing a succession of notes on early occurrences of the term ‘social science’. Successive scholars coming across the term – in Mill, in Comte, in Saint-Simon – each wondered whether they had stumbled upon the earliest usage. Since the concept of social science in the Enlightenment was my chosen dissertation topic, I thought I could begin with a more systematic investigation of the history of the term. I had an intuition that it could be found in Sieyès’s Qu’est-ce que le tiers état?, but turning the pages of a copy of that tract published in 1789 did not disclose it. The road instead led me to Condorcet, who had named the subject in the plans for public instruction he proposed during the French Revolution, from him to its inclusion in the organization of the Institut de France, and thence to the ideologues appointed to positions in that institution. From their writings, the term passed into English, on one side of the Atlantic via a Spanish translator of Bentham’s works, and on the other side via Thomas Jefferson’s translation of a text by Destutt de Tracy. I thought I had a pretty definitive essay on the subject to offer the Journal of the history of ideas, but that journal haughtily decided that it had no interest in considering further articles on the topic. I published the paper elsewhere only to learn later that I had been right about Sieyès: he had used the term in the first edition of Qu’est-ce que le tiers état? but had removed it from the many others published later the same year, only one of which I had searched. I mention this by way of saying that, having always been fascinated by the history of words, I was immediately excited when Robert Morrissey, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, floated the idea that a digital database being used to create a new French dictionary, the Trésor de la langue française, might also be utilized for other research purposes. I was an enthusiastic participant in the complicated and sometimes amusing negotiations that led eventually to the creation of ARTFL (American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language) and became one of its earliest users. I still have remnants of the reams of printout generated by then-clumsy searches in the database for early co-occurrences of ‘opinion’ with ‘publique’, and by efforts to gauge the frequency and correlates of basic Enlightenment terms like ‘société’, ‘social’ and ‘révolution’. How far ARTFL has come from those early days! Over the years, Morrissey and his brilliant team of collaborators have turned it into an immense resource for studying the Enlightenment while developing a powerful research engine (now PhiloLogic4) that is also available to scholars exploring texts in other fields and languages. One key step in the development of ARTFL was the digitization of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and D’Alembert, that massive keystone of the Enlightenment. This was a major accomplishment but it also opened an immense challenge. Generations of scholars had surfed the work’s seventeen folio volumes of text and its eleven volumes of plates. Its very bulk had made it a work more cited than read. What questions could now be addressed to this digital version? What could it be good for? This was the spirit in which Dan Edelstein and I first offered a graduate seminar on the digitized text at Stanford in 2006. It was immediately obvious that digitization would make it possible to address more systematically some longstanding questions about the work, its contributors, its organization, the classification of its articles and its treatment of various topics. But that seminar fired a desire to dive more deeply below the surface of the text, to ask about its sources and citations (or lack of them), to detect sunken materials and preserved traditions, on the one hand, and the often silent harvesting of modern thought on the other. Collaboration with the ARTFL team on the development of methods to answer such questions led eventually to the path-breaking sequence alignment analysis by Dan Edelstein, Robert Morrissey and Glenn Roe that revealed the extensive but largely unacknowledged borrowing of the encyclopedists from the work of Montesquieu, Voltaire and countless others. (A similar analysis of the ECCO database, reported below by Clovis Gladstone and Charles Cooney, has also made clear the massive resonance of the Bible in eighteenth-century English texts.) More discoveries of this kind will doubtless follow as scholarly interest and the stock of comparable machine-readable texts expand. As Robert Morrissey and Glenn Roe make clear in their essay in this volume, the digitized Encyclopédie is destined to become a critical ‘living’ edition of that work of which earlier scholars could only have dreamed. In the meantime, ARTFL now offers scholars the opportunity to use its search engine to open up the history of another great collective enterprise of the French Enlightenment through its recent digitization of all three editions of the abbé Raynal’s Histoire des deux Indes. If the Encyclopédie, why not the entire Enlightenment? Or which Enlightenment? Will a comprehensive topical analysis of eighteenth-century works one day allow us to discern more precisely an identifiable Enlightenment discourse emerging within it? Will it instead reveal a cacophony of Enlightenments? Clio is greedy, she always wants more. From Oxford she has received massive tribute in the form of Electronic Enlightenment, the pioneering achievement of Nicholas Cronk and Robert McNamee for the Voltaire Foundation, which is gathering into a single database the growing number of digitizations of the correspondence of individual Enlightenment authors. Cronk describes the process and editorial promise of this development below. Dan Edelstein, in turn, captures the excitement unleashed by the generous sharing of metadata from Electronic Enlightenment that made possible the creation of the Mapping the Republic of Letters project by Edelstein, Paula Findlen, Caroline Winterer and Giovanna Ceserani. Their engagement produced some unexpected results – notable, for example, in the visualization of Voltaire’s correspondence and of the nesting of an Enlightenment network within the Old Regime establishment. It also stimulated the serious and sophisticated reflection on visual design as an element of humanistic enquiry that has given birth to Palladio, the remarkable new tool for that purpose described below by Nicole Coleman. Major digital humanities engagements beyond the Chicago–Stanford axis are also brought to more general view in this volume. From MIT, Jeffrey Ravel presents a striking account of the development of the ambitious Comédie-Française Registers Project. He makes clear the imperative towards institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration inherent in digital humanities research while hinting at the tensions, vicissitudes and anxieties inherent in this endeavour and pointing out the questions about audience it raises. From Western Sydney University, Simon Burrows provides an update on the major resource he and his team have built over decades for research into the history of the eighteenth-century French publishing trade (FBTEE). This now includes the invaluable bibliography of eighteenth-century French novels described by Angus Martin and Richard Frautschi in their contribution to this volume. Gargantuan in its ambitions, FBTEE expands the range and enhances the power of Burrows’ database of French books sold by the Société typographique de Neuchâtel, the bookseller Robert Darnton made familiar to Enlightenment scholars as the purveyor of the forbidden bestsellers of enlightened Europe. His analysis sharpened by ongoing engagement with Darnton’s conclusions, Burrows invites researchers to confront the complexities of eighteenth-century publishing and the challenges of representation and interpretation they present. Navigating such complexities is far from easy. There is nothing mechanical about this work. It requires intellectual sophistication, historical intelligence, subtle judgement and endless decisions. Essays in this volume on research engagements related to FBTEE – by Alicia Montoya on analyzing catalogues of private libraries, by Katherine McDonough on confronting problems of identifying and locating early-modern places, and by Laure Philip on disentangling and representing available information regarding clandestine publications – each offer granular accounts of the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges of deriving and analyzing digital data. They are echoed in this respect by the contributions of Elizabeth Bond and Robert Bond on their topic modelling of French provincial newspapers and by Melanie Conroy and Chloe Summers Edmondson on their enquiry into the participants in Paris salons. As the editors acknowledge in their introduction, the publication of this volume opens an opportunity to weigh the achievements and promise of digital humanities against the cautions, criticisms and dismissals often levelled at it. Some of the latter are political: behind the digital humanities they see efforts of neoliberal academic administrators and their funding allies to destroy the traditional university or undermine the critical practices of the humanities within it. These charges appear to make digital humanities the stalking horse for an indictment of more general perceived tendencies within the contemporary university rather than engaging directly with it. However, the assumption that close reading of texts can be critical and disruptive while their distant reading is necessarily reactionary seems unexamined. The computer might as readily be used to disclose linguistic regimes of oppression as to sustain or advance them. More frontal dismissals of digital humanities research contrast ravenous costs in money and labour with a paucity of results. ‘Garbage in, garbage out!’ may be one of the most common tropes of disparagement, but there is ample evidence in the following essays to belie the image of philistine feeding of lumpen, ill-considered data into mindless machines. As for the common critique that digital humanities expends vast resources to unveil what we already know or mere common sense would have expected, there is much in this volume to rebut it. The comparatively circumscribed circulation of Voltaire’s correspondence is an obvious example of an unexpected result. The plagiarism of Montesquieu in the Encyclopédie might have been intuited, but its full extent would have been almost impossible to demonstrate without the technology of sequence alignment. The resonance of the Bible in eighteenth-century English texts might well have been expected by some scholars without our ever knowing how great it is. Or not. It is worth remarking that we think we know many things without knowing how well we know them, or without acknowledging that the things we think we know or expect may not turn out to be true, and are often in any case incompatible one with another. Eventually, I imagine, the term ‘digital humanities’ will become redundant, and computer-assisted humanistic research will cease to exist as a specialized field. Its methods will be absorbed by humanistic scholars more generally, serving and stimulating them in a variety of ways and to varying degrees according to their interests and the questions they pose. As that happens, this volume will be acknowledged as marking an important step in that direction.;https://liverpooluniversitypress.manifoldapp.org/read/6da0056908e47c275a3058bab145e5ad/section/a4d2adbf-6a51-4ca9-acd8-3f6a3a7524d8;

Call for papers | DHASA 2021;Call for papers DHASA Conference 2021Notice the extended submission deadline (29 August 2021) Theme: “Digitally Human, Artificially Intelligent” The Digital Humanities Association of Southern Africa (DHASA) is organizing its third conference with the theme “Digitally Human, Artificially Intelligent”. The field of Digital Humanities is currently still rather underdeveloped in Southern Africa. Hence, this conference has several aims. First, to bring together researchers who are interested in showcasing their research from the broad field of Digital Humanities. By doing so, this conference provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of Digital Humanities especially in the Southern Africa region. This includes Digital Humanities research by people from Southern Africa or research related to the geographical area of Southern Africa. Second, the conference allows for information sharing among researchers interested in Digital Humanities as well as network building. By bringing together researchers working on Digital Humanities from Southern Africa or on Southern Africa, we hope to boost collaboration and research in this field. Third, affiliated workshops and tutorials provide information for researchers to learn about novel technologies and tools. These related events are aimed at researchers interested in the field of Digital Humanities, to focus on specific aspects of Digital Humanities or to provide practical information for researchers to move into the field or advance their knowledge in the field. The DHASA conference is an interdisciplinary platform for researchers working on all areas of Digital Humanities (including, but not limited to language, literature, visual art, performance and theatre studies, media studies, music, history, sciology, psychology, language technologies, library studies, philosophy, methodologies, software and computation, etc.). It aims to create the conditions for the emergence of a scientific Digital Humanities community of practice. Suggested topics include the following: Additionally, topics specifically related to the theme of the conference are requested, among others: Submission Guidelines The DHASA conference 2021 asks for three types of submissions: Additionally, student submissions (where the first author is a student) are especially encouraged.  All submissions should adhere to the style guide and can be submitted through the registration system.

Digital Humanities is thriving, and the essential role that libraries, archives and museums play in digital humanities initiatives is increasingly being recognised. Digital Humanities: An introduction for librarians provides practical advice for embedding digital humanities activities into daily operations of cultural heritage institutions, and inspiration for library and cultural heritage professionals wanting to actively engage with the digital humanities community. Which approaches have led to successful partnerships and collaboration with digital humanities researchers, and how to provide best access to digital collections, are among the questions readers can find answers to in this book. Content covered includes: • insights from humanities researchers working with digital methods across a range of disciplines including tips and tricks for successful collaborations with libraries and other cultural heritage institutions  • the opportunities and challenges of providing access to digital cultural heritage collections including case studies from key initiatives such as the 'Collections as Data' and 'GLAM Labs' movements • key tools and methods used by the digital humanities community including text and data mining, social network analysis and spatial humanities  • a range of organisational considerations for library managers wishing to strategically embed digital humanities support into the daily work of the library • how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can help libraries stay ahead of the game.  Featuring contributions from some of the leading researchers and practitioners in the field, this book provides an accessible, introductory guide to digital humanities specifically designed with librarians and cultural heritage professionals in mind.

 Computing touches every aspect of teaching and learning at MIT, and the humanities are no exception, with scholars across disciplines using computational tools to answer critical questions in humanistic research. MIT is uniquely positioned to innovate in the digital humanities, with widespread skills in coding and deep engagement in the humanities. Bridging the gap — creating a “bilingual” community, as MIT President L. Rafael Reif calls it — to make connections across diverse research interests will be one key to success. Now, a new collaboration between the MIT Programs in Digital Humanities (DH Lab) and the MIT Libraries is helping foster relationships among scholars with intersecting interests in computational culture. Since September 2020, the DH Lab has partnered with the libraries to present Digital Teaching and Research Collaborative Sessions, a weekly series of virtual events that provide a regular, informal space for faculty and researchers to connect with DH Lab staff, MIT librarians, and with one another. Recordings of these sessions are now available on the MIT Libraries’ YouTube channel. “We wanted to hold open space for instructors and researchers across SHASS [School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences] to meet and share their insights and experiences in online learning during this unprecedented year,” says Stephanie Frampton, associate professor of literature and faculty director of the DH Lab, founded in 2018 to build community through undergraduate research opportunities (UROPs), faculty research, visiting scholars programs, and events. “It began with a week of workshops on tools for online teaching just before the fall semester and grew into a year-long series of more than 30 events involving faculty, researchers, students, and librarians from all corners of the Institute and beyond. It’s been wonderful to see Thursday afternoons become a real touchstone for the community.” Frampton and DH Lab Research Associate Erica Zimmer, who was instrumental in organizing and running the events, were eager to partner with the MIT Libraries’ Ece Turnator, humanities and digital scholarship librarian, and Mark Szarko, librarian for comparative media studies, literature, philosophy, and theater arts. With the pandemic prompting a switch to remote learning, both librarians had been working extensively with faculty looking to enhance teaching and UROPs with digital tools. “Ece and Mark had already been working to bring the digital humanities forward at MIT, making people aware of tools, techniques, and case studies through IAP [Independent Activities Period] sessions, workshops, and a resource guide,” says Zimmer. “People at MIT know the libraries can help them figure out where they need to go next with a project, so their partnership has been crucial in that regard.” “It makes sense for the libraries to be a partner in creating community around the digital humanities,” says Szarko. “MIT faculty have a wide range of research interests, and the MIT Libraries provide a sort of neutral ground for making connections across disciplines. It’s a place that welcomes everyone.” The series started informally, with “water cooler” sessions on topics such as student engagement and strategies for teaching online. Other sessions demonstrated particular resources such as annotation, mapping, and text analysis tools, the collaborative publishing platform PubPub, or Relata, an experimental search tool for humanistic scholarship. Presentations also showcased underutilized collections at MIT, such as Archnet, a digital library developed by the Aga Khan Documentation Center. Perhaps most crucially, the series introduced participants to other scholars with similar research interests. “I enjoyed brainstorming with fascinating new — and old — colleagues that I would not have had a chance to speak with otherwise,” says Michel DeGraff, professor of linguistics and director of the MIT-Haiti Initiative, who attended multiple events. With an average of 25 to 30 participants at each session, the virtual events drew not only MIT scholars from various humanities fields, but also attendees from chemistry, electrical engineering and computer science, mathematics, and MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as journalists, filmmakers, and others beyond the Institute. People have tuned into the sessions, which are open to those with no prior experience using digital techniques in research or pedagogy, from at least nine different countries. With a return to on-campus teaching and research activity projected for the fall term, session organizers are discussing ways to carry forward the strengths of the series as well as the insights and sense of community cultivated during this unusual academic year. Whatever format these discussions take in the future, their goal remains the same. “We’re trying to create an ecosystem of knowledge and connections,” says Turnator. “The sessions are an opportunity to not only learn more about specific tools and resources but to see who else at MIT — and beyond — is interested in similar types of problems.” The MIT Programs in Digital Humanities are generously funded, in part, by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Data Feminism;The MIT Press 2020 A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.;https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/;
Digital Humanities Minor | Department of English;"Jump to content
  Open to students in all majors, the DH Minor focuses on the fusion of technology and the humanities. In recent years everything about the printed word has changed. What we read, where we write, and how we interact with books, stories, words, and images have profoundly altered our relationship with the cultural arts. The minor in DH explores what happens when the humanities meets the digital age.        The minor in DH creates opportunities to tell stories and make interpretive arguments by creating digital projects, such as:           *archives              *timelines           *movies                *maps           *games                 *new dynamic editions of cultural texts           *podcasts             *data visualizations Minoring is easy. You’ll need to take ENG 250 (offered in fall and winter terms) and ENG 470 (offered in spring terms) and an additional four elective courses approved for the minor. See below for a growing list of university courses approved for the DH minor. A schedule of current English department courses that count toward the DH minor can be found by following this link. To qualify for the DH minor, students must pass 6 courses: TWO required courses:   FOUR additional courses (2 of which must be at upper division level).  To insure interdisciplinary, these four courses must come from at least two different departments. Please see the UO course catalog for term listings of course offerings. Notations in parentheses, such as A&L, IPT, indicate courses that also satisfy CORE requirements.               All course work must be passed with the grade of mid-C or better. (Grades of C- or lower, and courses graded P will not count for the minor.).                                                                                                                                                     In this course you’ll learn how to use digital tools to read and analyze literary and cultural texts. For example, you may learn how to set up and keep your own blog; how to create maps of a literary work or a social problem; how to use topic modeling to study networks in a collection of many texts; how to find and curate data; or how to annotate or publish your own digital edition of a novel or poem. The course emphasizes both an introduction to a set of digital tools used in the field of DH, and on finding ways to apply those tools to the study of literary and cultural texts. Technologies and Texts Capstone is a course designed to address the digital turn in public contemporary culture, academic culture, and the humanities. This turn has profound implications for the way we interact with and understand the role of the humanities in the public sphere and the transmission of the written word into digital forms. At the center of this course is the creation of an original term-length digital research project (must be approved in advance by the Professor). Projects can be created by individuals or can be part of a collaboration with a faculty member or fellow classmates. Possible term-length projects include: Projects will be accompanied by a final explanatory essay. Together, project and essay will demonstrate proficiency with both the digital tools used to build the project and the subjects the project addresses.     For questions about Spring 2022 courses, please contact your teacher.

Digital Humanities & Critical Infrastructure Studies Workshop Series – Critical Infrastructure Studies.org;Critical Infrastructure Studies.org Thinking about the built, repaired, and lived things of the world—how we make them, and how they make us. This series of meetings aims to enliven discussion about infrastructure from the perspective of Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, as a contribution to the emerging field of Critical Infrastructure Studies. The growing body of literature on the concept of infrastructure — in science and technology studies, media studies, cultural studies, and DH — prompts questions about why infrastructure is essential for studying people’s practices, what kinds of subjects are embedded in infrastructural systems, and, in particular, how the world can be transformed through infrastructural interventions. A focus on infrastructure reveals the materiality of practices, as a set of conditions that are laid down by various actors: academic institutions, cultural units, technology companies, publishing houses, and governmental bodies. Surfacing the relationships between these heterogeneous entities can give us an insight into the manufacture of substrates that are not fixed, but relational objects. Infrastructure is an articulation of materiality that is constantly in formation across space and time, as Nikhil Anand et al. argued in The Promise of Infrastructure (2018). A thing is therefore in the process of becoming infrastructure and composed of socio-technical assemblages that emerge from tensions between institutional actors, policies, and knowledge practices. These tensions — expressed as a clash between functionality and sustainability, standardisation and resistance to universality, open and closed technologies — located in infrastructure make it a valuable object of critical inquiry. DH can contribute to debates about modern infrastructure by offering unique humanities-centred theoretical and practice-led analyses of infrastructure and possessing the capacity to unlock a range of technical, socio-cultural, and political perspectives Infrastructural Interventions.

CFP: Race, Medicine, and Health · Reviews in Digital Humanities;"Race, Racism, and Health is a critical area in medical and health humanities that considers the historical development of racism and its effects on medical knowledge; access to care and treatment; and definitions of illness, health and wellness. In recent years, technology has further exposed not only linkages between structural racism, violence, and health outcomes but also the role technology plays in human-centered design in healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many of these issues to the forefront once again and inspires critical questions: How can computational methods combined with humanistic inquiry offer transformative understandings of the relationship between race, racism, and health? What are the sources, processes, and presentation decisions that define a digital humanities project on race, racism, and health, and what specific parameters and functionalities are applied? How can the impact of digital technologies on humanities research methods and approaches foster new theoretical frameworks and research techniques in race, racism and health? How can humanities methods and perspectives shape new approaches to race and racism within medical and health settings? We invite submissions from scholars, artists, community-based organizations, healthcare professionals, and others who use digital tools and humanities methods to address the intersections of race, medicine, and health, especially those with projects that use digital tools to intervene in or provide resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are particularly interested in projects on COVID-19 and intersecting crises (e.g. racial justice, voter suppression, anti-Asian hate, and white nationalism). In addition to the above-mentioned topics, we invite projects related to any aspect of health, medicine, and race in the digital humanities: practical experimentation, theorizing, cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary work, and new and relevant developments. Submissions are welcome from projects at all stages, with a minimal requirement that the project have a publicly viewable website that demonstrates the central methods and concerns of the project.  Submission Details Please send the following information to reviewsindigitalhumanities@gmail.com with “SI: RHM” in the subject line: The title and website URL for the project; Project director’s name, institutional affiliation, email address, and brief bio; and 100-word abstract for the project.  If your project is selected for inclusion in the special issue by the guest editors, you will be invited to contribute your project overview as part of the journal’s review process. If your project is not selected for the special issue, it may be invited for inclusion in another issue of the journal by the journal editors.";https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/cfp-race-medicine-health;
Responding to COVID with Digital Humanities – CC 4th;"CC 4th Be sure to check out the current story at Bethel News: it features History professor Charlie Goldberg and his Advanced Digital Humanities students, who spent part of last fall using the tools they were learning in class to respond to the same pandemic that was reshaping life on campus. DH majors used photogrammetry to create 3D images of objects that connected to their experience of COVID-19. “As historians,” said Prof. Goldberg, “we know it can be easy to make sense of life in hindsight. But, when you’re in the midst of uncertainty, it can be hard to make sense of the mess. This project provided an opportunity for us to create a meaningful narrative from our pandemic experiences.” “The breadth and depth of students’ work showcases one of the primary strengths of the digital humanities,” concluded Bethel writer Jenny Hudalla: “its broad applicability to a variety of disciplines. Students in the program—who belong to majors as diverse as history, software engineering, psychology, business, art, biblical and theological studies, philosophy, graphic design, and media production—learn to fuse the search for knowledge about human culture with a greater understanding of digital-age skills. By bringing the expertise of their primary major into contact with other disciplines, Goldberg says, they develop the ability to innovate alongside peers from different backgrounds—and they become more compelling candidates to future employers.” Read the full article here.

Scottish Graduate School for Arts & Humanities - Summer School 2021 - Intl Summer School 2021 Sessions (Tuesday) - Transnational History as Spatial History: the case of the Esperanto Movement ...;English is today’s Globish. Today, English is the language that eases international trade, cross-border and cross-cultural communication. English is part and parcel of the most recent phase of globalisation and internationalism since post 1945. While there are pragmatic, historical, and linguistic reasons for English as the globally dominant language, such dominance is not without problems as a language – along with its cultural implications – imposes hierarchies. The native speaker will always be in a dominant cultural position vis-à-vis the non-native speaker. Around 1900 English was not yet the dominant global language. French was in decline to some extent. German made up ground in the sciences and engineering during a phase of rapid industrialisation in the later nineteenth century, yet it was deemed as too complex to take over. It was the auxiliary, planned language Esperanto that promised to fill that void around 1900 as a universal second language. Esperanto was devised as an easy to learn and neutral language. As such it deliberately did not carry any culturally hegemonic context with it. Esperanto was born in East Central Europe. It was the Polish-Jewish doctor Ludwik Zamenhof, a native of Białystok in Tsarist Russia (today’s Poland) who designed the language and published the first language manuals in the late 1880s. The language quickly found followers not only in Russia but in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Great Britain, Bohemia, Serbia and beyond Europe, for instance in Japan and China. Between 1900 and 1914 hundreds of local Esperanto groups sprang up. Journals were founded alongside national organisations. In 1905, when the first annual international congress was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France, more than 8,500 Esperantists attended the congresses before 1914. By 1910 it was taught in 320 schools in 17 countries, with more than 1,200 cities and towns offering evening classes. The Esperanto movement around 1900 can be characterised as a loose and geographically broad transnational network of local internationalists. Among these were prominent professional groups including teachers, lawyers, engineers, doctors, and architects. This workshop aims at providing an insight into the Esperanto movement in the early twentieth century. It will showcase a transnational historical perspective in theory and practice. The workshop is based on selected secondary reading focusing on transnational actors. Based around a number of selected primary sources (member lists, Esperanto journals, correspondence, postcards, congress participation) it will give an insight into archival practices, the ‘paper trail’ of transnational sources, as well as into different Digital History methods (datasets, databases, mapping and visualization).

Open Access Monograph Bursary for early career DH researchers by DARIAH – Archives Portal Europe Blog;"DARIAH-EU is launching an annual Open Access Book Bursary for the publication of one’s first monograph within the domain of Digital Humanities. The bursary will fund the Open Access publication of one monograph (or other long form of scholarship) per year. By doing so, DARIAH-EU aims to further strengthen its long-standing commitment to pave pathways to the open research culture as it specifically pertains to arts and humanities disciplines and to enable early career researchers, who are usually less privileged in institutional Open Access grants, to openly disseminate their first monographs in book series that are topically most relevant for their field of interest. The DARIAH OA monograph bursary aims to serve as a modest but immediate contribution to ease the current anomalies and support those who are the less privileged in this respect but could possibly achieve the biggest change in academic culture and beyond. For more details about the considerations behind the call, eligibility criteria and how to apply, go to https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/14/dariah-is-launching-an-annual-open-access-monograph-bursary-for-early-career-researchers-in-digital-humanities/ Fill in your details below or  an icon to log in:

Digital Humanities @ Oxford Summer School | Digital Scholarship @ Oxford;"Supporting innovative digital research In 2021, we held our largest ever summer school, fully virtual for the second year. In 2022 we are looking forward to welcoming you back to Oxford in person, giving you the opportunity to engage with experts in the Digital Humanities on a wide range of topics alongside students and researchers at every stage of their career path. The event will take place at Keble College, Oxford, from 11-15 July, with morning lectures and afternoon interactive workshops. We will also be live-streaming the morning sessions in a virtual strand of the Summer School, for those unable to attend in person. Booking for the 2022 Summer School has not yet opened.  for our mailing list to be the first to know when tickets are available. Our 2022 Summer School offers more lectures, talks and workshops than ever before. As well as our live-streamed introductory lectures, we will have special talks giving a comprehensive tour of Digital Humanities, and in-person workshops every afternoon to develop your practical DH skills. See below for more details on each of these strands. Our selection of keynote lectures from leading Digital Humanists will be announced shortly. This lecture-based survey strand gives you a thorough overview of the theory and practice of Digital Humanities. Drawing on expertise from across the University of Oxford and our national and international collaborators, and on the University's library collections, it will appeal to anyone new to the field, or curious to broaden their understanding of the range of work the Digital Humanities encompass. Those attending in person will participate in sessions each morning and afternoon including the lectures, but will also participare in additional demonstrations and practical workshops each afternoon. Those attending online will join lectures each morning and be able  to ask questions to the lecturers digitally.  On completing this course, you will be conversant with the variety and potential of the various technologies used to collate, interrogate, and facilitate digital work in the Humanities. You will also have gained insight and practice in methods relevant to your own research.  No prior technical knowledge is necessary for this course. Participants are not required to bring their own laptops but may find it useful. What happens when archives become digital? How are digital archives made? Who does it? Where do they do it? And why? In the course of addressing some of these questions, this strand will help its participants to frame and negotiate some of the major considerations in making and working with digital and digitalised archives. Through practical sessions and theoretical discussions, participants will gain insight into the possibilities and challenges presented by digital archives and working with cultural heritage materials digitally. Working with both digitised and born digital materials, participants will be introduced to a number of core concepts and digital tools for collecting, cleaning and processing data for and from digital archives, as well as open-source solutions that can be used for catag, enriching, and publishing digital and digitised materials Hands-on sessions will be complemented by lecture and seminar-style discussions of issues surrounding digital archival practice. These will help participants to frame the creation and use of digital archives within their theoretical, political, ethical, cultural, and technical contexts, and enable them to make more informed decisions in their future interactions with digital archives.   There are no specific skills requirements for this strand, and it is designed to suitable for anyone working with archives and their digital counterparts. This workshop is an introduction to the theories and practices of capturing, querying, and publishing information online using the Linked Data method. Participants will learn about the theory behind Linked Data, and discuss challenges, opportunities, and the ethical considerations in using this methodology. During the workshop, participants will complete the workflow for converting tabular data into RDF (the Linked Data format). Each participant must bring a laptop (not a tablet!) with the required software pre-installed. Please check that you have administrative rights to install software on your machine. This workshop will consider public, collaborative research methods, particularly crowdsourcing, in the context of digital humanities. Aimed at researchers of all backgrounds, participants will engage with current and historical issues around crowdsourcing; propose, evaluate and discuss individual projects of their own making; and learn about best practices for social engagement with volunteers, long-term project health and sustainability. Participants will leave with a greater understanding of how to approach crowdsourced research in a way that balances data quality and ethical volunteer engagement. Over the course of the week, in addition to discussion and reflection, participants will design and build a crowdsourcing project prototype with their own dataset, using the Zooniverse Project Builder. Participants should arrive for the workshop prepared with a project concept and example data (for example, 50 digital images of objects, books, or contents of archival collections—an ideal dataset is one for which the same line of questioning can be applied to each image). Participants will discuss their projects and the design and building process with the group. Morning sessions on this strand will be lecture and discussion-based, afternoon work sessions will allow participants to incorporate concepts from the morning sessions into their own crowdsourcing projects. This workshop combines taught and practical sessions with case-studies introducing the use of the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), with a focus on the representation and publishing of primary sources. TEI is a very broad and flexible standard, so we will also concentrate on how TEI can best be used in specific research contexts.  We will showcase a number of projects in the fields of digital editing, text-analysis and publication. Case studies will cover both specific textual phenomena and those common to diverse media and genres. Core aspects of TEI to be covered in the hands-on exercise sessions include structural elements of texts, metadata, representing people, places, dates and groups, the transcription and description of documents, encoding correspondence, and how to query, transform and publish your texts. No previous experience with markup, XML, TEI, or editing is assumed. Participants will leave with a grounding based on practical experience in what the TEI can do to represent both the physical and the linguistic features of documents, how it can inform the analysis of texts, and how it can form part of a publication pathway. This strand introduces methods for recording, analysing and displaying cultural heritage (sites, material and visual culture). This includes the digital capture of objects, the creation of 3D models, and the employment of these models in interactive immersive experiences. No pre-requisite knowledge. Software will have to be downloaded prior to the course. This strand introduces a variety of approaches to dealing with humanities data. It covers modelling, structuring, and working with data, plus longer-term curation and preservation. Data types discussed include textual, tabular, image-based and time-based media. Attendees will hear from presenters experienced in working with these methods, and be given the opportunity to try some of them for themselves via practical exercises. The goal is to equip researchers to select solutions that will work for them.  Each participant is recommended to bring a laptop (not a tablet!). Please check that you have administrative rights to install software on your machine. This hands-on workshop offers an introduction to natural language processing in Python, from processing texts to extracting meaning from them, as well as the basics of automated semantic analysis with machine learning. We will focus on practical applications (from preprocessing texts to enriching them with linguistic knowledge via part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing) and we will show how to work with raw, semi-structured, and tabular data. We will show the basics of topic modelling, and how this technique can be used for humanities research in order to explore the content of large collections. Finally, we will provide an overview of semantic analysis using word embeddings, and how this technique can be used for a large variety of humanities research, such as tracking semantic change or understanding biases in a corpus. At the end of the workshop, participants will have acquired basic practical skills and knowledge on how Python can be used for processing humanities textual data. They will leave with an understanding of key aspects of natural language processing and how these can be applied to their research in the humanities.  No prior knowledge of Python or natural language processing is required. However, participants may find this workshop difficult to follow if they are not acquainted with the basic concepts of text analysis in digital humanities. This workshop offers an introduction to data analysis techniques of practical use to humanities scholars and GLAM professionals. Topics include: data formats (XML, JSON), the Python data analysis stack (Pandas), how to get from messy to tidy data, basics of data analysis and visualization, advanced topics (modelling) and applications (topic modelling), best practices to communicate and share your results (licensing, repositories). Classes are hands-on and interactive, as we will work with real-world examples of metadata (e.g., the British Library catalog), text (e.g., historical newspapers) and relational data (e.g., social networks). Attendees will have the opportunity to work on their own projects and/or on proposed exercises.   This is an advanced workshop: exposure to Python and the basics of scripting is strongly recommended. This could be acquired for example via previous attendance of the Text2Tech workshop or equivalent courses or self-learning.

Digital Humanities Tilburg – TSHD Digital Humanities Symposium;"June 29 & 30, 2022 How do we calibrate or modulate our (dis)trust when it comes to sources of information, given limited resources of time and attention? How do we decide what sources and voices to trust in our present media landscape, where an unprecedented number of resources for (mis)information and entertainment is available?  Why do people with different worldviews interpret the same data differently, or have altogether different views on what constitutes factual information in the first place?   In our ‘post-truth age’, public opinion appears less influenced by objective facts and more by personal beliefs. Companies, media, and influencers enter into competition for capturing and retaining our attention.  In both online and offline media, we see a blurring of the lines between factual and fictional discourse.  Online echo chambers and algorithmic biases lead to a pervasive influence of confirmation bias and filter bubbles.  Increasing political polarization and the mainstreaming of conspiracy thought amount to a deep-seated distrust of groups outside of the own community, and of things as they seem. In journalism, fact checking is often posed as an objective remedy to this fake news crisis, while traditional gatekeepers like mainstream journalistic media, experts, and scientists have lost some of their standing. The question of truth seems to increasingly be replaced by the question ‘who tells the most compelling story?’ This two-day symposium brings together scholars from a range of disciplines, including Philosophy, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cultural, Literary and Media Studies, Communication and Information Sciences, and Cognitive Science, to engage in a cross-disciplinary dialogue on these matters. The event includes a range of talks as well as a couple of interactive workshops on key methodological tools for Digital Humanities research. Times of rapid transformation can give us the opportunity to rethink our fields of research and education as well as their main concepts and values. With this event, we aim to answer such questions from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. We invite speakers to present on a broad range of topics including, but not limited to, the cognitive (e.g., studies of beliefs and bias), arts and media (e.g., truth and fiction in literature, television and film, or news websites), philosophical (e.g., the ontology and semantics of fact and fiction), Artificial Intelligence (e.g., virtual reality; algorithmic creativity; automatic analyses of discourse to trace polarization, fake news, content featuring conspiracy theories and others) and  communication and information studies (e.g., online misinformation; the role of truth-finding on social media). Submitted papers should feature digital humanities methods or include reflections on digital media and technologies. This two-day, hybrid symposium—part on-site at the campus of Tilburg University, part online—brings together scholars from a range of disciplines, including Philosophy, Culture Studies, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cultural, Literary and Media Studies, Communication and Information Sciences, and Cognitive Science, to engage in a cross-disciplinary dialogue on these matters. The event includes keynotes, a range of talks, and a number of specialist panels on Digital Humanities research.   Keynote speakers:  Emar Maier (University of Groningen)  Miriam Metzger (UC Santa Barbara)  Martina Raponi (Willem de Kooning Academy)  Dirk Hovy (Bocconi University) Submit a 300-word anonymized abstract (excluding references), consisting of the title and a short description of your proposed paper to Easychair by April 15, 2022. This symposium is organized by Inge van de Ven (TSHD, Department of Culture Studies), Sander Verhaegh (TSHD, Department of Philosophy), Giovanni Cassani (TSHD, Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence), Frédéric Tomas (TSHD, Department of Communication and Cognition), assisted by Rebecca de Jongh.

 Three renowned researchers in digital humanities and computer science are joining forces with the Library of Congress on three inaugural Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud projects, exploring how biblical quotations, photographic styles and “fuzzy searches” reveal more about the collections in the world’s largest Library than first meets the eye.Supported by a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded in 2019, the initiative combines cutting edge technology with the Library’s vast collections to support digital humanities research at scale. These three outside researchers will collaborate with subject matter experts and technology specialists at the Library of Congress to experiment in pursuit of answers that can only be achieved with collections and data at scale. These collaborations will enable research on questions previously difficult to address due to technical and data constraints. Expanding the skills and knowledge necessary for this work will enable the Library to support emerging methods in cloud-based computing research such as machine learning, computer vision, interactive data visualization, and other areas of digital humanities and computer science research. As a result, the Library and other cultural heritage institutions may build upon or adapt these approaches for their own use in improving access to text and image collections. “We know there’s so much more treasure to be unlocked here at the Library and in institutions across the country and around the world, and technology can help us understand these collections even more,” said Kate Zwaard, director of digital strategy at the Library of Congress. “We want to generate evidence that we can use to make decisions and invest in our future, and we also hope that this work is useful for others to use and adapt in their own organizations.”The three experts beginning work this month are:Lincoln Mullen, associate professor at George Mason University in the Department of Art and Art History and director of computational history at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, will research “America’s Public Bible: Machine-Learning Detection of Biblical Quotations Across LOC Collections via Cloud Computing.” Dr. Mullen is no stranger to Library collections, having won first place in the 2016 Chronicling America Data Challenge.Lauren Tilton is an assistant professor of digital humanities at the University of Richmond in the Department of Rhetoric & Communication Studies and is co-director of Photogrammar and the Distant Viewing Lab. Tilton’s project, “Access & Discovery of Documentary Images” will examine approximately 250,000 images from five early 20th century photography collections. The project will look for ways computer vision methods could be improved to better consider context and enhance discovery.Andromeda Yelton, a software engineer and professionally trained librarian, will research “Situating Ourselves in Cultural Heritage: Using Neural Nets to Expand the Reach of Metadata and See Cultural Data on Our Own Terms.” Yelton’s project will create an interactive data visualization that clusters conceptually similar documents, helping users who only have a rough idea of the items they’re looking for. The project will use a searching capability that utilizes machine learning and “fuzzy search” to help users discover and navigate Library collections.In addition to the generosity of the Mellon Foundation, the Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud initiative is bolstered by the Library’s significant investments in IT modernization. In late 2020, the Library transitioned to a hybrid hosting environment consisting of multiple secure physical data centers and the cloud.

$3 million funding investment for Canberra collaboration to protect our future biodiversity and biosecurity - University of Canberra;"Katarina Slavich 28 January 2021: After the devastating effects of Australia’s Black Summer, some species of our native plants and animals came close to extinction. Now, thanks to a ground-breaking collaboration between Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT), the University of Canberra and The Australian National University (ANU), an integrated big data platform powered by transformative genomics and populated with thousands of flora and fauna species will be accessible to users around the world to track the impact of events like bushfires and assist with the management of our natural ecosystems. Canberra-based company DArT will invest $3 million to develop the platform, $1.2 million of which will come from the ACT Government’s Priority Investment Program, to support the cross-university collaboration. Assistant Minister for Economic Development Tara Cheyne said the ACT Government’s Priority Investment Program invests in projects that connect industry, research and the tertiary education sector to attract investment and grow established and emerging priority areas of Canberra’s economy. “This platform that has been built by local Canberra company DArT will turbo-charge the research capabilities of people working in plant and animal biodiversity conservation, natural resource management, agri-technology and biosecurity. “This means researchers and scientists will be better able to understand the impacts of events like bushfires and climate change on plants and animals by accessing data from around the world that would otherwise be lost. “The project will create up to 10 new jobs and is a wonderful example of local collaboration between our tertiary education sectors and local industry,” said Minister Cheyne.  Building on the success of its past 20 years, DArT, based at the University of Canberra, has accumulated a hundred years’ worth of genetic data in plants and animals. It has teamed up with the University and the ANU to establish the big data analysis platform, which government agencies, the resources industry and researchers can access to better manage our environment’s valuable ecology. “Genomic data from plants and animals can be powerful when it comes to managing our environments – however, if we can combine it with other environmental data and apply the latest advances in big data analytics, then the understanding we can generate is significantly magnified,” said DArT Director, Dr Andrzej Kilian. “DNA itself is only one piece of the puzzle. The Internet of Things and other sources of environmental data are also extremely valuable and, when combined with DNA data, provide a rich variety of information to enable us to assess the alarming decreases in biodiversity and biosecurity.” The big data platform will enable the tracking of changes in biodiversity to facilitate better management of environmental and other impacts on ecosystems. A significant part of the project is already underway, focusing on the impact of the Black Summer bushfires in 2019-20. Researchers had previously collected data before the bushfires hit and have returned to the impacted areas to collect further data. The platform will help identify what plant and animal species died and what has recovered. The technology will also help large resource companies to map the ecology of the areas they are working in, assisting them to meet their environmental obligations.  Development of the platform in Canberra and its subsequent international commercialisation will produce high-value, knowledge-based jobs for the local economy, making Canberra a leader in the development of this technology worldwide. This is the power of combining the knowledge and expertise that exists of universities with the innovation and agility of local high-techcompanies. Acting University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor, Professor Geoff Crisp said the University’s contribution to this important project derives from a long-standing collaboration with DArT. “Imagine the significance of this platform in helping to save our ecosystems,” he said. “The University of Canberra is excited to further strengthen our relationship with a local company that is doing ground-breaking research, both in Australia and internationally. “We are excited to help implement the big data analysis platform so the research and development community can collectively better manage biodiversity and biosecurity.” ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt said that we must innovate and collaborate to protect Australia’s incredible biodiversity from catastrophic events, such as Black Summer bushfires, as they become more frequent and destructive. “As the national university, ANU is committed to projects that build Australia’s resilience and capabilities for the future. We’re proud to contribute our established expertise in biology data sciences and our brightest students to this initiative. ""I want to thank the ACT Government for investing in this vital work to grow data science capability in Canberra, which will help save species from extinction across the globe. “We are excited to work with UC and the ACT Government on this important project.” UC acknowledges the Ngunnawal people, traditional custodians of the lands where Bruce campus is situated. We wish to acknowledge and respect their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of Canberra and the region. We also acknowledge all other First Nations Peoples on whose lands we gather.";https://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/media/newsroom/2021/january/$3-million-funding-investment-for-canberra-collaboration-to-protect-our-future-biodiversity-and-biosecurity;
Researchers Develop Method to Create 3D ‘Map’ of Tissue Structure and Function;"A newly published approach to profiling human tissue samples can build a 3D picture of structure and function at the molecular level. The procedure marries techniques from chemistry, biology, and data science and could help doctors design precision therapies in the coming years for patients who aren’t responding to treatment. In a study of human tonsil tissue, the researchers combined a labeling scheme using isotopes to “tag” specific kinds of cells — in this case, immune cells such as T-cells and B-cells — with imaging mass spectrometry that can identify metabolites, the molecules around those cells that are used for various metabolic functions. And instead of doing this on a single, two-dimensional “slice” of tissue, they used data from about 150 slices to create a 3D map of the tissue. “An analogy to our system is actually geography: We create the geography of tonsils — where are the valleys, where are the mountains. But when we are doing that, we are looking at more granular features, [including] which molecular distributions are around, and how do they really change within this tonsil tissue,” said Ahmet Coskun, Bernie Marcus Early Career Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. “Typically, the metabolites are measured in one experiment, and these protein-specific labels are measured in another, separate experiment. Bringing the two together in a unique, single measurement is one of the advantages here,” he said. Coskun’s team used tools from data science to turn all of that data into a 3D map of the tonsil tissue, which Coskun said is more accurate since the tissues are three-dimensional themselves. They described their unique approach — combining two disparate measurements into a single test and processing a huge amount of data to make a 3D map — Jan. 27 in the journal Science Advances. They call the technique a “3D Spatially resolved Metabolomic profiling Framework.” “You've seen in hospitals how MRIs are done — they can make entire body 3D. That's not done at the microscale, unfortunately,” Coskun said. “When you look at microscale things, they're just two-dimensional slices most of the time.” Coskun and his team studied B-cells in tonsils, important harbingers of a potential infection. Tonsils are one of the first areas that sense a foreign bacteria or virus, and the immune cells there warn the body to prepare to fight an invader. The team’s spatial map showed the locations of T-cell and B-cell concentrations. It also discovered lower concentrations of specific kinds of fat molecules called lipids that the B-cells use to proliferate and create antibodies. In experiments looking at nearly 200 different kinds of metabolites and lipids, the researchers uncovered a unique “code” that identified where specific lipids related to different kinds of cell function were depleted. “That is information you can use to understand how tonsils respond to outside foreign objects that are interfering our bodies,” Coskun said, “and then how those specific anatomical regions in tonsils use their metabolites and lipid content to respond to them.” Understanding structure and function in conjunction also can pinpoint how cells are using energy, depleting oxygen, or otherwise working in the body, he noted. “You can use this information to design precision therapies and to find the best drugs for that specific person,” Coskun said. “Drug libraries attack this specific mechanism or that specific mechanism, so by comparing the drug libraries and a specific patient's structure and function profiles, you can actually design personalized drugs for that specific patient.” That’s still a few years down the road — Coskun said the specialized machines his team used to develop the metabolic profiling are still expensive and mostly housed in research centers. But: “The biochemical methods that we developed, they're easy; they can be done in any lab,” he said. “Getting the measurements done is the rate-limiting step here.” Coskun said he could imagine a centralized service where healthcare providers send patient samples for testing — akin to how genetic sequencing is done now. But as technology advances and the machines get cheaper, he said they could end up in more and more hospitals. His team also is developing a cheaper, custom device to overcome the limitations of requiring costly, relatively rare equipment to employ his team’s approach. “Our goal is discovery. We'd like to use this machine to survey a number of patients who respond to certain drugs and who don't respond to certain drugs,” Coskun said. “We'd like to compare these groups of patients for a personalized therapy approach. We want to make the framework from our end, so that it's ready for clinicians to adapt later.” Coskun’s team on the study included graduate students Shambavi Ganesh, Thomas Hu, Mayar Allam, and Shuangyi Cai as well as Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology researchers Eric Woods and Walter Henderson. Already, Coskun and his collaborators are exploring what his 3D profiling approach can tell researchers about lung and prostate cancers, visualizing how immunotherapies affect the interplay between the immune system and tumors. “There are cancer cells and immune cells, and we'd like to understand why and how they're interacting, and then, when they come together, what happens to the structure and function in what we call the tumor microenvironment,” he said. “If you understand the structure and function of that tumor macroenvironment better, then you can trace back which mechanisms worked or haven't worked.” This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health K25 Career Development Award K25AI140783, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and the Bernie Marcus Early Career Professorship.

Saskia Lippens was satisfied with the images she was feeding into a program to identify borders between cells and organelles at the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB) in Belgium. So she hesitated when graduate student Joris Roels offered to use an algorithm to filter out the noise from the input micrographs, even though he said it would improve her border-finding results. “An electron microscopist is always a little bit cautious when people talk about restoration of images,” says Lippens, director of the institute’s microscopy core facility in Ghent. “What if we’re changing data? What if we make mistakes?” Roels, now a postdoctoral researcher at the VIB, convinced her by promising that a human biologist would always look over the computer’s shoulder, checking the images and selecting the right de-noising approach. When Lippens tried to find those borders again using de-noised pictures, she was impressed with the improvement. “This was really a much better starting point,” she says. 

‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures
 ‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures Noise, put simply, is everything in an image that isn’t real signal. The weaker the illumination, the noisier the image, which explains the graininess of night-time mobile-phone selfies — not to mention low-light photomicrographs taken to protect fragile samples. But no image is completely free of noise. “It’s always there,” says Michael Elad, a computer scientist at the Technion — Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. To minimize it, researchers have long applied de-noising algorithms, the earliest incarnations of which were mathematical processes developed by computer scientists. “Then came the deep-learning era,” says Elad. By passing the images to computers and allowing them to work out the best de-noising approach, researchers have begun to see striking results. “It’s pretty magical,” says Loïc Royer, who works on image processing and light-sheet microscopy at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, California. But the magic does have risks: biologists must take care not to lose or muddle valuable signal.

(CC BY 4.0) Old-school, human-written algorithms still work well much of the time, and many have been built into popular image-processing environments, such as ImageJ, Fiji and MATLAB. Elad favours an approach called block-matching and 3D filtering, which groups together image sections that are similar in content and noise, and filters noise from each group before reassembling the image. Carolina Wählby, director of the national SciLifeLab BioImage Informatics Facility at Uppsala University in Sweden, uses an algorithm called Top-Hat to clean up background noise in fluorescence micrographs and other images. (Top-Hat performs a mathematical transformation to remove overly bright or dark elements from an image.) “In many cases, something simple like that works really well,” she says. Machine learning goes a step further, with the computer first learning how to de-noise one set of images, then applying what it has learnt to new data. “You skip the middleman, the mathematician,” says Royer. There is one catch, however: the computer’s reasoning isn’t always apparent. “The learning algorithm is building a very complex black box that extracts the essence of what the images are about, and it just works,” says Royer. 

Deep learning takes on tumours
 Deep learning takes on tumours There’s also the added computational cost, particularly during the training phase. Timely training might require computers linked to multiple graphics processing units or cloud-based servers. However, once the machine has finished this phase, researchers can usually de-noise images with a standard laptop, says Avinash Nehemiah, who manages computer-vision product marketing at MathWorks, the developer of MATLAB, in Natick, Massachusetts. In ‘supervised’ learning-based approaches, the machine knows what it is looking for, because the user trains it with matching pairs of noisy and clean images. “Supervised, with the right data, will always give you the best results,” says Florian Jug, a computer scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany. Supervised models get better as users provide more input pairs. But researchers don’t always have pre-cleaned images available. In that case, they can try algorithms that train themselves. According to Jun Xu, a computer scientist at Nankai University in Tianjin, China: “The new direction of this field is the development of self-supervised algorithms.” Some of the first entrants in this self-supervised category, Noise2Void and Noise2Self, were developed in the past few years. The developers assume that every pixel value is a bit off owing to random noise, but that nearby pixels should offer strong hints as to what the value should be, explains Royer, who co-developed Noise2Self. For each pixel, the machine uses the surrounding pixels to predict the proper value. It can then apply those parameters to new pictures. “The noise doesn’t survive this process, because the noise is information that is only on that pixel,” says Royer. Microscope images of a Caenorhabditis elegans worm embryo, before (left) and after de-noising using Noise2Void software (right).Credit: C. Broaddus et al./Proc. IEEE Imaging specialists have already begun to improve on this technique. For example, Noise2Self and Noise2Void fail if noise is not randomly distributed throughout the image. But Coleman Broaddus, a graduate student at MPI-CBG, tweaked Noise2Void to circumvent this issue. With his version, called StructN2V, users select a multi-pixel area that matches the size of the noisy bits of their image. Then, the machine-learning algorithm attempts to de-noise by predicting the centre value for that patch on the basis of surrounding pixels. The output from such models, whether classical or based on machine learning, can look spectacular. But that doesn’t make it real. “There’s a trade-off,” says Nehemiah: the image is cleaner, but it also has been modified. And the stronger the noise, the more likely it is that those changes will be significant. “When the noise becomes very strong — so strong that you hardly see the image — then the results are sort of hallucinations,” says Elad. 

Deep learning for biology
 Deep learning for biology For example, in an attempt to eliminate blur from images scanned quickly, Wählby and a student trained a machine with pictures of an empty electron microscopy grid that created a pattern of stripes. When they ran the trained model on new pictures, extra stripes appeared. “It learnt to find stripes, rather than to understand motion blur,” Wählby says. The fix was to add more training data: specifically, a set of clean and noisy images without stripes. With that addition, the machine correctly learnt to remove the blur. And some images are just too noisy to salvage. Rupali Mankar, who works with infrared imaging data at the University of Houston in Texas, says that she checks for this by taking multiple pictures of the same sample. If the output changes widely between images, she says, “it’s not a good signal, it’s just noise”. Digital hallucinations and the like are relatively rare in Jug’s experience. When de-noising goes wrong, it’s usually obvious because images look blurry or weird, he says. “It is surprising how little these problems arise.” That said, Jug advises image analysts to include raw, noisy data in paper submissions or post the data on publicly available servers. That way, readers and reviewers can compare the data before and after for themselves. Many journals have teams that check images for mistakes in image manipulation, notes Kevin Eliceiri, a biomedical engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Researchers should also take care to validate results using a secondary method, suggests Wei Ouyang, a computer scientist at SciLifeLab at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. For example, one might use a different imaging technique, such as a wider field of view, to confirm that the de-noised data make sense. It was the biologist’s ‘human-in-the-loop’ evaluation that gave Lippens the confidence to de-noise her electron microscopy images. She, Roels and their collaborators designed an ImageJ plug-in called DenoisEM that’s equipped with eight classic de-noising approaches. Using a graphics processing unit for speed, microscopists can try different options and fiddle with parameters until they are satisfied with the results. “It’s really the biologist, the expert, who decides what you’re going to use and not use,” says Lippens. 

NatureTech
 NatureTech For advice, researchers can try their local microscopy facility or an online community such as http://forum.image.sc. Mankar suggests that scientists who are new to imaging might also want to consider online classes, such as those offered by the online education firm Coursera, or a hands-on boot camp. A growing collection of tools allows researchers to find and compare multiple de-noising approaches, and contribute new ones. For example, CSBDeep, developed by Jug and collaborators, is an online machine-learning toolbox that can be used with the Fiji image-processing environment or Python programming language. Likewise, Ouyang’s web app ImJoy offers a one-stop shop for test-driving multiple machine-learning methods. Ouyang, Jug and others are also developing Bioimage Model Zoo. Microscopists will populate this repository with pre-trained machine-learning models for de-noising and other purposes, such as segmentation, which might allow users to skip the computationally costly training step. But borrowing another researcher’s model can be dangerous, says Jug, and it’s important that there is a close match between their data set and yours. A model trained to clarify microtubules, for instance, might fail when applied to pictures of nuclear membranes — or even to images of microtubules from a different microscope set-up. But if both signal and noise are similar, pre-trained models can work, says Lei Zhang, a researcher in low-level computer vision at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. In any event, today’s models and algorithms are not the last word in image de-noising, says Elad. “It’s an ever-running Olympics: everybody trying to beat everyone else.” For researchers such as Lippens, the future — and photomicrography — has never looked clearer.

Can an AI Predict the Language of Viral Mutation? | WIRED;"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

Application Prediction Text analysis End User Research Sector Health care Research Technology Machine learning Natural language processing Viruses lead a rather repetitive existence. They enter a cell, hijack its machinery to turn it into a viral copy machine, and those copies head on to other cells armed with instructions to do the same. So it goes, over and over again. But somewhat often, amidst this repeated copy-pasting, things get mixed up. Mutations arise in the copies. Sometimes, a mutation means an amino acid doesn’t get made and a vital protein doesn’t fold—so into the dustbin of evolutionary history that viral version goes. Sometimes the mutation does nothing at all, because different sequences that encode the same proteins make up for the error. But every once in a while, mutations go perfectly right. The changes don’t affect the virus’s ability to exist; instead, they produce a helpful change, like making the virus unrecognizable to a person’s immune defenses. When that allows the virus to evade antibodies generated from past infections or from a vaccine, that mutant variant of the virus is said to have “escaped.” Scientists are always on the lookout for signs of potential escape. That’s true for SARS-CoV-2, as new strains emerge and scientists investigate what genetic changes could mean for a long-lasting vaccine. (So far, things are looking okay.) It’s also what confounds researchers studying influenza and HIV, which routinely evade our immune defenses. So in an effort to see what’s possibly to come, researchers create hypothetical mutants in the lab and see if they can evade antibodies taken from recent patients or vaccine recipients. But the genetic code offers too many possibilities to test every evolutionary branch the virus might take over time. It’s a matter of keeping up. Last winter, Brian Hie, a computational biologist at MIT and a fan of the lyric poetry of John Donne, was thinking about this problem when he alighted upon an analogy: What if we thought of viral sequences the way we think of written language? Every viral sequence has a sort of grammar, he reasoned—a set of rules it needs to follow in order to be that particular virus. When mutations violate that grammar, the virus reaches an evolutionary dead end. In virology terms, it lacks “fitness.” Also like language, from the immune system’s perspective, the sequence could also be said to have a kind of semantics. There are some sequences the immune system can interpret—and thus stop the virus with antibodies and other defenses—and some that it can’t. So a viral escape could be seen as a change that preserves the sequence’s grammar but changes its meaning. The analogy had a simple, almost too simple, elegance. But to Hie, it was also practical. In recent years, AI systems have gotten very good at modeling principles of grammar and semantics in human language. They do this by training a system with data sets of billions of words, arranged in sentences and paragraphs, from which the system derives patterns. In this way, without being told any specific rules, the system learns where the commas should go and how to structure a clause. It can also be said to intuit the meaning of certain sequences—words and phrases—based on the many contexts in which they appear throughout the data set. It’s patterns, all the way down. That’s how the most advanced language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-3, can learn to produce perfectly grammatical prose that manages to stay reasonably on topic. One advantage of this idea is that it’s generalizable. To a machine learning model, a sequence is a sequence, whether it’s arranged in sonnets or amino acids. According to Jeremy Howard, an AI researcher at the University of San Francisco and a language model expert, applying such models to biological sequences can be fruitful. With enough data from, say, genetic sequences of viruses known to be infectious, the model will implicitly learn something about how infectious viruses are structured. “That model will have a lot of sophisticated and complex knowledge,” he says. Hie knew this was the case. His graduate advisor, computer scientist Bonnie Berger, had previously done similar work with another one of her lab's members, using AI to predict protein folding patterns.  So this spring, Berger's lab tried out Hie’s analogy, and the results are out today in Science. At first, the team had been interested in influenza and HIV, which are both notorious for evading vaccines. But when they began their lab work in March, sequences from the novel coronavirus were becoming available, so they decided to add those in as well. For all three viruses, they homed in on sequences for the proteins the viruses use to enter cells and replicate, explains Bryan Bryson, a professor of biological engineering at MIT and a coauthor of the research. These also happen to be primary immune system and vaccine targets. They’re the places where antibodies latch on, preventing the virus from entering a cell and marking it for destruction. (For SARS-CoV-2, that’s the spike protein.) For each of the viruses, the MIT team trained a language model using the genetic sequence data instead of the usual paragraphs and sentences. Then they checked on what the model learned about the sequences. Sequences deemed to have similar “meanings” should infect the same hosts, the researchers reasoned. The genetic language of a swine flu would be semantically more similar to another swine flu than a flu that normally infects humans. They were pleased to see that this was the case—and also to find that certain strains that had spilled from one species to another in the real world, like avian flu in 1918 and 2009, were scored as semantically similar. Then they checked the grammar. How well did a sequence’s “grammar” score correspond to how viable a virus was in real-world conditions? The researchers gathered data from past research quantifying the fitness of various mutants—how well they binded to or replicated in cells—for all three viruses, and then examined how grammatical the model believed those sequences to be. Grammaticality seemed to be a good proxy for their fitness. But Bryson and Hie wanted to know if combining the two proxies could predict viral escape. When they compared their model’s predictions to prior known instances of actual viral escape, the influenza model was the most predictive. That wasn’t surprising, because the data set they used to train the model was particularly large, including years’ worth of influenza sequences and a wealth of mutations known to sneak past the human immune system. For SARS-CoV-2, they checked their predictions against escape mutants that had been artificially derived, passed through antibody-rich serum until the selection pressure produced mutants that could evade the antibodies. (In other words, not anything we currently need to worry about in the real world.) The correlation was looser. The model flagged most of the true escapees but also sequences that weren’t.  Still, it’s a start that could give virologists a better grip on where natural mutations are headed. “This is a phenomenal way of narrowing down the entire universe of potential mutant viruses,” says Benhur Lee, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the work. The predictions are only as good as the data that goes into it, he adds. And as the researchers note, that means the model misses certain nuances, because escape is not always only a function of mutations the virus acquires. HIV is a good example. Sometimes, the sequence doesn’t change, and viral proteins are still recognized by antibodies, but those proteins are shielded by a type of sugary compound called a glycan. Lee points out that the AI predictions are good for telling researchers what they already know. It correctly identified, for example, the two parts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike that researchers believe are more inclined to accumulate escape mutations, and another section that’s more stable, and thus a better antibody target. But it remains to be seen whether its predictions can provide truly novel insights. One area where the paper’s authors believe computational models will be most useful is in identifying so-called “combinatorial mutations” that involve many changes built on each other. But that will likely require much more data to make them produce good leads for lab scientists like Lee. The next step, which will begin this Friday with Bryson’s collaborators in another lab, will involve creating some of the predicted SARS-CoV-2 mutants in the lab and seeing how they fare against antibodies in serum taken from recovered and vaccinated individuals. They’ll be using what’s known as a pseudotyped virus, which can test how well the antibodies neutralize a particular variation of the virus, but are not dangerously infectious. They’ll also test a few sequences picked up in efforts to sequence viral samples from Covid-19 patients that the model suggested were more primed for escape than others, Bryson says. The lab members are wondering whether their analogy may apply in other situations. Could a similar model predict if an immune system will grow intolerant of a particular cancer treatment, or how a tumor mutation might evolve to evade the body’s controls? With the right data, Bryson’s lab would like to try it out. “A good analogy can go a long way,” he says.

OHIO professors advance international astronaut and space biology research;"Ohio University faculty are part of a team of researchers who have published a special compilation of papers that is being described as the largest set of astronaut and space biology data ever produced.  Nathaniel Szewczyk, Ph.D., professor of molecular medicine at the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, and Sarah Wyatt, Ph.D., professor of environmental and plant biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, coauthored six of 29 papers recently published by NASA in a special compilation of Cell Press journal articles called “The biology of spaceflight.” The OHIO researchers are among more than 200 investigators from dozens of academic, government, aerospace and industry groups to contribute to the articles.  The effort brought together a unique collaboration across the four largest space agencies in the world – NASA, JAXA, ESA and ROSCOSMOS – with research spanning longitudinal multi-omic profiling, single-cell immune and epitope mapping, novel radiation countermeasures and detailed biochemical profiles of 56 astronauts.  Szewczyk, who also holds the Heritage Endowed Professorship in Molecular Medicine, Osteopathic Heritage Foundation Ralph S. Licklider, D.O., Research Endowment, coauthored the papers, “Comparative transcriptomics identifies neuronal and metabolic adaptations to hypergravity and microgravity in Caenorhabditis elegans”; “A New Era for Space Life Science: International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP)”; and “Revamping Space-omics in Europe.” He and Wyatt coauthored the paper, “NASA GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline: Standardized Processing of Short-Read RNA-Seq Data.”  Some of the groundbreaking work reported in these papers used NASA’s GeneLab, a repository for all genomics data related to space flight and gravity. The GeneLab is intended to be used by scientists to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses for determining systemic biological responses occurring in spaceflight. Space biologists around the world rely on these omics data to maximize the knowledge gained from spaceflight experiments. “The GeneLab was set up to analyze large data sets of molecules that change in response to space flight, and continues to collect existing data from the past, as well as generates new data from ongoing flights,” Szewczyk explained. “There is a push to look at whether we can use such data sets to better understand astronaut health and to see what lessons can be learned in similar experiments.” Wyatt learned about the GeneLab after working on her first space flight experiment in 2015 and decided to use her OHIO Faculty Fellowship Leave to work with NASA developing the GeneLab more and helping establish it as a place for accessible data. “Sarah was truly invaluable in setting up GeneLab’s agenda,” said Sigrid Reinsch, Ph.D., principal investigator and research scientist at NASA-Ames Research Center. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups have also developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline is all publicly available through the GeneLab database.  “The GeneLab’s pipeline is a fantastic opportunity for scientists and anyone interested in the data to have easy access to the results and to use this information to compare experiments,” Wyatt said. “When we looked at the data sets from previous experiments, we knew we needed to integrate and expand them so others could utilize this data. I’m excited to see NASA take this on and publish the details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline, as well as to see a former Ph.D. student of mine, Colin Kruse, as an author on this paper.”  Kruse graduated with a Ph.D. from OHIO’s interdisciplinary graduate program in molecular and cellular biology in 2019, a program which Wyatt also directs. He is currently a post-doc at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  Most of Wyatt’s research includes her work with gravitational biology and how plants respond to gravity. She has conducted experiments, while at OHIO, sending plants into space to see how genes are regulated in response to spaceflight and will do so again on a flight mission slated for May.  Szewczyk also has a spaceflight experiment slated to launch on the same mission as Wyatt’s, making it the first time two OHIO professors will have experiments launching on the same mission.  © 2022 Ohio University.

Partition Quantitative Assessment (PQA): A quantitative methodology to assess the embedded noise in clustered omics and systems biology data | bioRxiv;"Identifying groups that share common features among datasets through clustering analysis is a typical problem in many fields of science, particularly in post-omics and systems biology research. In respect of this, quantifying how a measure can cluster or organize intrinsic groups is important since currently there is no statistical evaluation of how ordered is, or how much noise is embedded in the resulting clustered vector. Many of the literature focuses on how well the clustering algorithm orders the data, with several measures regarding external and internal statistical measures; but none measure has been developed to statistically quantify the noise in an arranged vector posterior a clustering algorithm, i.e., how much of the clustering is due to randomness. Here, we present a quantitative methodology, based on autocorrelation, to assess this problem. The authors have declared no competing interest. View the discussion thread.

Analyzing the COVID-19 genome with AI and data mining techniques (paper + data + code) | The Data Mining Blog;"Recently, my team has been working on analyzing COVID-19 genome sequences using pattern mining and other data mining and AI techniques. We have recently published a paper in the Applied Intelligence journal about this. In this blog post, I will give some brief overview of this. The PDF of the paper can be found here: And the source code and data:  https://github.com/saqibdola/SPM-MA4GSA The main idea of the paper is the following. We have obtained genome sequences of different strains of the COVID-19 virus. These genome sequences can be viewed as strings of letters (nucleotides). For example, below is four sequences of nucleotides: Then, after preprocessing these sequences, it is possible to analyze them using pattern mining algorithms and other artificial intelligence techniques.  The main process is the following: First we prepare the data (step 1), and then we apply different techniques (step 2). First, we have applied itemset mining, sequential pattern mining and sequential rule mining techniques to find patterns that are common to many genome sequences. Some examples of sequential patterns (sequences of nucleotides that appear often) find by the CM-SPAM algorithm are below: This is just to give an overview. Other types of patterns are discussed in the paper in more details. Second, we also tested sequence prediction models to see if the nucleotides in genome sequences can be predicted. We compared various models offered in the SPMF data mining software and got results like this: In general, prediction of genome sequence does not give a high accuracy but still better than a random prediction. We discuss these results in more details in the paper.  Third, we also designed some mutation analysis algorithm to compare different strains of the coronavirus. For example, by comparing two strains, we identified some mutations: That is just a brief overview of the paper!  There are many possibilities for extensions of this research. In particular, various other pattern mining algorithms and machine learning algorithms could be applied as well. Using the code and data provided above, you can also make your own research on this topic! Besides, the tools presented in this paper can also be applied to other genome sequences beside the COVID-19 virus. Hope this has been interesting.   —Philippe Fournier-Viger is a professor of Computer Science and also the founder of the open-source data mining software SPMF, offering more than 120 data mining algorithms.

Enzolytics Announces The Discovery Of Seven Newly Identified Conserved Target Sites On The HIV Virus;"Company begins process of identifying conserved/immutable target sites on SARS-CoV-2 (the CoronaVirus) and other developments COLLEGE STATION, TX / ACCESSWIRE / February 1, 2021 / Enzolytics, Inc. (OTC PINK:ENZC)(the “Company”) today announced it has identified seven additional conserved, expectedly immutable sites on the HIV virus against which it plans to produce targeted anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies. The Company’s primary anti-HIV monoclonal antibody targets one conserved site on the HIV virus, which site is 98% conserved (either directly or by way of conservative amino acid substitutions) over all 87,336 HIV isolates which have now been curated (analyzed) by the Company using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additional conserved target sites (some with 98% conserved sequences) have now been identified against which fully human anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies will be produced in its lab on the campus of Texas A&M University in the University’s Institute for Preclinical Studies. The significance of producing multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting multiple conserved sites is recognized by experts as a critical approach to effective therapy. This allows the administration of a “cocktail” of antibodies, all targeting conserved and expectedly immutable sites. Additionally, the Company’s Genetics and Molecular Biology data science team is now screening (using computer analysis/Artificial Intelligence [AI]) more than 275,000 CoronaVirus isolates now known, to also identify conserved sites which expectedly are immutable. From this information, anti-SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVirus) monoclonal antibodies will be produced. The significance of producing monoclonal antibodies against conserved target sites on targeted viruses is made evident by the mutant strains of the CoronaVirus currently surfacing in the U.S, South Africa, Brazil, United Kingdom and around the world. The same virus mutation exists with HIV, as well as other well-known viruses. As a virus mutates, a therapeutic becomes ineffective when it neutralizes by attacking a site that changes. By targeting an immutable site, a therapeutic is not affected by the mutation. This is well understood by the necessity to produce a new flu vaccine with each flu season, namely because the flu virus mutates. Producing therapeutics that target a conserved site on viruses makes possible the production of a therapeutic that is not rendered ineffective by virus mutation, and therefore can be applied successfully both universally around the world and durably over time. The Company is also applying Artificial Intelligence [AI] to scan the hundreds of thousands of isolates that exist in 14 other prevalent viruses, ranging from influenza to Rabies to Ebola. Using the Company’s proprietary technique for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies directed against these infectious diseases, the Company will produce multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against these viruses. The significance of this approach is well recognized by experts in virology due to the ability of all viruses to mutate and render ineffective initially developed therapeutics. Production of the Company’s primary anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies is underway at Genscript Labs. Testing of these newly produced monoclonal antibodies is scheduled for early 2021 at the University of Strasbourg in Strasbourg France. Thereafter, Macaque trials are planned at the California National Primate Research Center, Univ. of California, Davis, CA. Additional information on the progress and Company facilities will be part of the new Company website expected to be rolled out in the coming days. In addition, the Company offers this update on its progress toward FDA approval of ENZC’s licensed ITV-1 Immunotherapy treatment previously tested in human trials in Bulgaria. On April 29, 2019, Bulgaria, as a member of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), was recognized under the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) between the FDA and European Union for medicinal products for human use subject to limitations. This allows drug inspectors to rely upon information from drug inspections conducted within countries recognized under the Treaty. The limitations stated on the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Website, listed as current as of 5/08/2020, read as follows: “The capability determinations apply to routine surveillance inspections. In the future the following product and inspection types may be included in the coverage of the agreement, pending further consideration:     Excluded from the MRA scope are: Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), human blood, human plasma, human tissues and organs and veterinary immunologicals.” To establish the effect of this new directive on the Company, Company representatives visited Sofia, Bulgaria last month and met with the Executive Director of Bulgarian Drug Administration (BDA) to determine how this treaty affects the use of the Company’s ITV-1 immunotherapy treatment which was successful in clinical trials completed in 2016. This meeting was followed by a meeting with a Clinical Research Organization, Clinic Design, in Sofia. The Company believes, and is currently reviewing the applicable information, that with the BDA recognition under the MRA and its membership in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), its Immunotherapy treatment should qualify for recognition by the FDA once the Clinical Trial process and Validation order have been completed. The Company has been informed that the inclusion of the BDA in the EMA restricted the permitting of our Treatment by the BDA and the permitting will now be done by the EMA for all the European Union. As a result, some, if not all of the clinical trials may need to be completed under the EMA standards. The company is evaluating the necessary steps and cost for the FDA submission under the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the FDA and EMA. Based on this information, the Company took the following actions. On January 28th, a notice of default and termination was registered with the courts in Sofia of the Sub License Agreement issued to IMMB BG. The company has entered into negotiations with a supportive group in Bulgaria to form a new entity and enter a funding agreement to cover any new cost of clinical trials under EMA standards and permitting by the EMA. Strategically, the Company believes that the actions will be cost effective resulting in a significant advancement of the Company’s therapeutic portfolio. As stated in the year end update, proposals were recently requested from several PCAOB accounting firms to provide quotes for Audits of the Company’s current and prior year Financial Statements in order to become fully reporting. The Company has engaged MaloneBailey, LLC of Houston, Texas as its PCAOB accounting firm and has begun the audit process. It is still the Company’s plan to complete the two-year audit as quickly as possible but will file the December 31, 2021 Annual Report Financial Statements pursuant to the OTC Markets Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines immediately upon completion to allow time to complete the two-year audits and remain current with our filings. CEO Charles Cotropia stated, “The Company is making significant progress on both of its therapeutic platforms: first, on the identification of prime target sites on both the CoronaVirus and the HIV virus and the creation of neutralizing antibodies directed against these sites, and second, on advancing its ITV-1 peptide therapeutic for patient application in the EU.” CSO Harry Zhabilov stated, “With the Bulgarian Drug Administration joining the European Medicine Agency and being recognized under the Mutual Recognition Agreement with the FDA, once we have successfully finished the permitting process the Company will be able to pursue FDA approval for ITV-1. We are currently investigating the required steps but feel confident that this is a viable option for the ITV-1 patented therapy.” About Enzolytics, Inc.; Enzolytics, Inc. is a drug development company committed to the commercialization of its proprietary proteins for the treatment of debilitating infectious diseases.

Scientists use AI to help save coral reefs;"Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Australia's tropical marine research agency is turbocharging facial recognition technology to analyse coral reef survey photos in a bid to keep pace with the rapid change in the threatened environments. Data from the images could one day help researchers around the globe better understand the impact of climate change and other human activity on ecosystems, including the Great Barrier Reef. Each year, scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science collect hundreds of thousands of underwater survey images of coral reefs for later study. But many reefs were changing so fast, scientists could not keep pace using traditional hands-on analysis technics, which are very time-consuming. AIMS's solution to break the analysis bottleneck was to bring facial recognition technology into the marine conservation space. The technology classified images hundreds of times faster than humans could but even it has been outpaced by rapidly evolving marine environments. ""The changes are happening really quickly and they aren't just on one reef but across the world,"" AIMS marine biologist Manuel Gonzalez Rivero told AAP. ""So the challenge was how can we fast track our way to documenting and understanding it to create a solid stream of data and knowledge. ""We quickly realised to get this fully operational and be efficient we'd need to bring in the big guns."" AIMS teamed up with technology developers in Ireland who have helped to further develop the agency's ability to collect and analyse reef monitoring data. They are also helping AIMS move towards harnessing the processing power and storage of cloud computing to beef up the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities. ""The rate at which we'll be able to generate knowledge will dramatically increase,"" Dr Rivero said. ""Having the capacity to understand what is happening on the reefs will help us to be more agile and make better decisions about how to protect coral reefs."" Dr Rivero said researchers also hoped to start sharing that information with marine scientists in other countries, where many reefs are in much poorer health than those found along the Australian coast. ""Reefs around the world are working but many are critical and if we push them too hard they could collapse,"" he said. ""Knowledge has to be shared across nations and organisations to make the most of it and better manage the consequences of our actions.""

AI can now learn to manipulate human behaviour;"Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Email is required Invalid email format This email has already been registered. Please sign in here. Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making. It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.  There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse. A team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.  The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time. In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.

      If machines can beat us at games, does it make them more intelligent than us?


 The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.   In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.  These findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society. But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.

      Australians have low trust in artificial intelligence and want it to be better regulated


 The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices. The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail). Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.  AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.  Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

Enzolytics Announces The Discovery Of Seven Newly Identified Conserved Target Sites On The HIV Virus;"Company begins process of identifying conserved/immutable target sites on SARS-CoV-2 (the CoronaVirus) and other developments COLLEGE STATION, TX / ACCESSWIRE / February 1, 2021 / Enzolytics, Inc.

In the future the following product and inspection types may be included in the coverage of the agreement, pending further consideration: Vaccines for human use Plasma derived pharmaceuticals Investigational products (clinical trial material) Veterinary products Excluded from the MRA scope are: Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), human blood, human plasma, human tissues and organs and veterinary immunologicals."" To establish the effect of this new directive on the Company, Company representatives visited Sofia, Bulgaria last month and met with the Executive Director of Bulgarian Drug Administration (BDA) to determine how this treaty affects the use of the Company's ITV-1 immunotherapy treatment which was successful in clinical trials completed in 2016. This meeting was followed by a meeting with a Clinical Research Organization, Clinic Design, in Sofia. The Company believes, and is currently reviewing the applicable information, that with the BDA recognition under the MRA and its membership in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), its Immunotherapy treatment should qualify for recognition by the FDA once the Clinical Trial process and Validation order have been completed. The Company has been informed that the inclusion of the BDA in the EMA restricted the permitting of our Treatment by the BDA and the permitting will now be done by the EMA for all the European Union. As a result, some, if not all of the clinical trials may need to be completed under the EMA standards. The company is evaluating the necessary steps and cost for the FDA submission under the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the FDA and EMA. Based on this information, the Company took the following actions. On January 28th, a notice of default and termination was registered with the courts in Sofia of the Sub License Agreement issued to IMMB BG. The company has entered into negotiations with a supportive group in Bulgaria to form a new entity and enter a funding agreement to cover any new cost of clinical trials under EMA standards and permitting by the EMA. Strategically, the Company believes that the actions will be cost effective resulting in a significant advancement of the Company's therapeutic portfolio. As stated in the year end update, proposals were recently requested from several PCAOB accounting firms to provide quotes for Audits of the Company's current and prior year Financial Statements in order to become fully reporting. The Company has engaged MaloneBailey, LLC of Houston, Texas as its PCAOB accounting firm and has begun the audit process. It is still the Company's plan to complete the two-year audit as quickly as possible but will file the December 31, 2021 Annual Report Financial Statements pursuant to the OTC Markets Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines immediately upon completion to allow time to complete the two-year audits and remain current with our filings. CEO Charles Cotropia stated, ""The Company is making significant progress on both of its therapeutic platforms: first, on the identification of prime target sites on both the CoronaVirus and the HIV virus and the creation of neutralizing antibodies directed against these sites, and second, on advancing its ITV-1 peptide therapeutic for patient application in the EU."" CSO Harry Zhabilov stated, ""With the Bulgarian Drug Administration joining the European Medicine Agency and being recognized under the Mutual Recognition Agreement with the FDA, once we have successfully finished the permitting process the Company will be able to pursue FDA approval for ITV-1. We are currently investigating the required steps but feel confident that this is a viable option for the ITV-1 patented therapy.""

Winchester-Nabu Detective Agency Year Four: Case File No. 43-199 – Amber Unmasked;Some content is adult/nsfw. Browse responsibly.  AMBER LOVE 08-MAR-2021 Find out how all this began. Catch up on Year One, Year Two, Year Three, and Year Four cases at the Winchester-Nabu Detective Agency. This work is supported by the generous backers who adore my cat stories at Patreon.com/amberunmasked and they also get first access to what’s happening with my books and podcast. For a one-time tip, you can go to the new PayPal.me.   There’s been a lot of mousing inside the residence and offices of the Winchester-Nabu Detective Agency. Not all perpetrators survived. Oliver Winchester has been waiting for a juicy case to emerge. He needs something to tantalize his little grey cells. Gus has been bored. He tends to get himself into trouble when he’s this bored. It often results in knocking things off tables. We were desperate for a new case. The Grumpy Old Man reported that there were five beasts in Gnome Grove one night. I have been putting out corn cobs, bird seeds, and peanuts hoping it would be enough to keep the beasts from starvation. I was shocked to hear that there were five of them. Based on the tracks in the deep snow, these beasts are a family of Jersey devil-deer, the hybrid of Jersey demon crossed with white-tailed deer. In the feline breeding world, hybrids are referenced as F1, F2, etc. to classify how many generations an animal is from the original breed. The Filial abbreviation system that Savannah breeders use wasn’t even applied correctly from the beginning so as far as those are concerned, you have to know the Savannah specific F system to truly understand what a breeder or owner is talking about. F1 indicates that a litter is the off-spring of the African serval. What we’ve decided to do with our devil-deer research is adopt the Savannah Filial system. An F1 devil-deer hybrid would therefore have one parent that is a Jersey devil and one parent that is a white-tailed deer. Due to the decrease in purebred Jersey devils (also called demons) in the wild, most cases will therefore be about the hybrid offspring the devil-deer. The Savannah Cat Association website has a useful table to show what subscript to classify a litter. For example, if an F1 parent mates with an F5 parent, the off-spring are F2. It’s a little bit of this and more of that then chromosomes do stuff and you have Jersey devil-deer running around the suburbs. The Grumpy Old Man said the five beasts he watched were all female (does). But, we know that white-tailed bucks lose their antlers yearly and grow them back bigger with age. This leads me to believe that it’s more likely the family he saw had at least one buck still being guided by its mother.  Speaking of sex chromosomes, I also learned about a truly fascinating natural occurrence in birds. A Pennsylvania man took a photo of a cardinal with bilateral gynandromorph characteristics! He was about an hour from the city of Erie. This unique type of cardinal was also spotted in 2019. These birds were split down the middle with the right side showing different sex traits than the left side. It’s as if a line was drawn through the sagittal plane of these birds.  This brings up the question as to whether an animal with bilateral gynandromorph traits can reproduce. The answer is probably. When it comes to the cardinals, the hormones may change with the seasons and only one ovary is needed. It’s also worth noting that we think it’s uncommon because of visual cues. The male and female cardinals are easily distinguishable because of their colors. Could that mean that an animal such as a deer possibly have this bilateral gynandromorphism since the main visual cue is antlers and size? I think it’s worth investigating and the cats agree. Is it possible that some day there will be photographs of a deer or devil-deer with antlers on one side of the head? I think it’s possible. The bilateral segmentation (split down the middle) isn’t the only way this appears. When the sex trait related tissues are in patches anywhere in the body, it’s call mosaicism. According to Natural History Magazine: Gynandromorphs occur in insects, spiders, crustaceans, and other arthropods as well as in birds, but they are extremely rare, and discovering one in the field or in the laboratory is a major event. Estimating how frequently they occur is difficult because they usually go unnoticed in species where sexual dimorphism is less pronounced. Gynandromorphs have been reported in mosquitoes, fruit flies, and in other insects, but they are most dramatic in those butterfly species in which the male and female wing colors and patterns are dramatically different. Several years ago, news spread worldwide that there was a gender fluid lion. Mmamoriri lives in Botswana. The lion is referred to as a lioness or “she” by humans. I doubt she cares about English pronouns at all. Mmamoriri was first noticed in 2012, but a later BBC documentary brought this Leo into the spotlight. Research scientists were able to get a blood sample from her and live to tell about it. Researcher Robynne Kotzee was documenting all the lions of a particular pride. She described Mmamoriri as a large, striking lioness with a black mane. Kotzee wrote: Mmamoriri is not the first of the western pride to sport a mane, nor is she the only maned female on Chief’s Island in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Martina, her predecessor, was regularly sighted around Mombo, and while her mane was much blonder, it was equally impressive. Recently, in one of the more southern prides on the concession, another young female has been spotted flaunting the first few tufts of a maturing mane. While this is not the norm, there has been an increase in reported incidences of these unusual felines on and around Chief’s Island over the last few years. Now that there’s obvious proof in mammals have gender fluidity, I don’t see why Jersey devil-deer or white-tailed deer would be an exception. So there. It happens in humans, crustaceans, birds, insects, and other mammals. There’s no reason to think it wouldn’t also occur in the Cervidae family. Based on our examination of the tracks in the snow and eyewitness accounts, we know a small herd of Jersey devil-deer are close. Though this isn’t a criminal investigation case, it is a research case. We’ll see what spring has to reveal about whether this was an all-female family or not.

AI can now learn to manipulate human behaviour;"Director, Data61
     Jon Whittle is Director for CSIRO's Data61.   CSIRO provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. Data61 provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making. It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.  There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse. A team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.  The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time. In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.

      If machines can beat us at games, does it make them more intelligent than us?


 The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.   In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.  These findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society. But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.

      Australians have low trust in artificial intelligence and want it to be better regulated


 The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices. The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail). Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.  AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.  Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees (UShER) Empowers Real-Time Phylogenetics for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic | bioRxiv;As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through human populations, the unprecedented accumulation of viral genome sequences is ushering a new era of “genomic contact tracing” – that is, using viral genome sequences to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large – and will undoubtedly grow many fold – placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for laboratories worldwide. Software Availability USHER is available to users through the UCSC Genome Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace. The source code and detailed instructions on how to compile and run UShER are available from https://github.com/yatisht/usher.

Bioinformatics is the Combination of Data Science and Biology;Data science is changing the future of the field of biology. Last year, the data visualization market for biology was estimated to be worth $808 million One of the newest applications of data science in biology is in the arena of bioinformatics.  ?Simple? may be a bit of a stretch when explaining anything that revolves around biological data and genetic codes, but the big-picture view of bioinformatics can, at least, help depict the importance of them regarding issues that the world faces, including the ongoing battle against COVID-19.  Data science has been integral to the field of biology for years. It has been used in synthetic biology and other applications before. However, some of the newer applications of bioinformatics are even more fascinating.  The Oxford dictionary definition of bioinformatics is ?the science of collecting and analyzing complex biological data such as genetic codes,? but that still doesn?t completely answer the question of ?What is bioinformatics?? Here is a baseline look at the study and practical uses of bioinformatics.  As the name would suggest, bioinformatics is a science involving parts of biology and data science (i.e., informatics). Data science is affecting the progression and accuracy of processes in fields from video games to medicine and everything in between, and when coupling the analysis capabilities of data science with the research and development capabilities of a field like biology, a lot of good can be done in a short amount of time.  For something like COVID-19, for instance, the study of epidemics fused with the study of information resulted in a marriage of epidemiology and biostatistics that helped inform researches on creating vaccines, as well as distributing them efficiently. Bioinformatics is a similar marriage, with biology being the science and informatics being the data analysis.  The data industry, in general, has been steadily progressing in the past decade, more and more each year. In the last five years, the industry value has grown from $122 billion to more than $200 billion, and is expected to reach ~$275 billion by the end of 2022. With this rapid growth, investments in all sectors of the data world are abundant, and bioinformatics is very much included.  With realizations that there are many areas where bioinformatics have yet to be utilized, the market is expected to triple in size by 2025, to an estimated $19.8 billion. It is a major breakthrough in data visualizations. It?s probably no surprise that advancements in medicine are leading this charge, financially, but the Biden Administration has also made pledges to fund data science research relative to healthcare, meaning the growth in this industry could become even more exponential if it continues to prove itself as a worthy investment.  Perhaps the easiest way to understand something is to see it in action, and here are 3 ways scientists are utilizing bioinformatics today: As mentioned before, the economic growth of the bioinformatics industry is expected to be rapid, but the reason for this is the rapidness with which the industry is expected to grow regarding utilization. Though already booming, the areas of science that have yet to really be able to utilize bioinformatics (likely due to funding) outnumber those that already are, meaning a lot of potential for growth on many, many levels. © 2008–2022 - All rights reserved Our website uses  to improve your experience.

Data Coordination Platform for the Human Cell Atlas - Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; For Updates Apr 28, 2020 Researchers need a way to explore the many datasets that scientists around the world are collecting as part of the global Human Cell Atlas project. The Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform (HCA DCP) is an open-source, cloud-based platform that organizes, standardizes, and compiles accessible data from the Atlas. Having these datasets available in one place in a unified format allows researchers to quickly extract important information about various cells and tissues that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases.  Building this data coordination platform requires collaboration between experts in bioinformatics, software engineers, and members of the user community. CZI is working alongside international leaders in scientific data infrastructure to formulate, fund, and jointly build the Human Cell Atlas data portal to enable the sharing of information across researchers and research institutes.  Collaborations are underway with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the Broad Institute, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Partnership with EMBL-EBI will ensure all data standards meet the exacting international criteria for data access and data sharing — such as permanent maintenance of data through EBI and deposition of all data into the European Nucleotide Archive or the European Genome-Phenome Archive, as appropriate.

Headless chicken called Miracle Mike lived for 18 months without a head – Learnography;"Cerebellar learnography of student’s brain is very powerful in the learning transfer of knowledge chapters. In my opinion, the fast learning transfer and smart brainpage modulation of children are associated with the development of strong cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry. These students can finish the complete span (Taxshila Span) of K-1 to Master’s Degree approximately five years earlier in life, if cerebellar learnography is launched successfully in the classroom by using the knowledge transfer of brainpage theory.  A headless chicken called Miracle Mike lived for 18 months without a head. It was determined that the axe had missed the jugular vein and a clot had prevented Mike from bleeding to death. Although most of its head was severed, but most of the brainstem and one ear were left on its physical body. Sometimes it is described as no brainer to show the reality of physical connection between brain and body. Since the basic functions of life process like breathing, circulation and digestion as well as most of a chicken’s reflex actions are controlled by the circuits of brainstem, Mike chicken was able to remain quite healthy in perching, walking and crowing. This is a good example of cerebellar motor generators enabling basic homeostatic functions to be carried out in the absence of higher brain centers. In fact, this headless chicken is considered as the miracle of neuroscience in the field of cerebellar learnography. Taxshila 2020 is the universal theory of knowledge transfer. Whole education, KG to master’s degree, should be finished at the age of 20 years. This is potentially fit age for working, productivity and earning. Cerebellar agenesis is a rare condition in which a brain develops without the cerebellum of core brain. The circuits of cerebellum control smooth movement with respect to space and time and coordinate the precise functions of emotional drives as well as cognitive knowledge in learning transfer. When it does not develop from the birth, the rest of the brain parts must compensate, which cerebellum cannot do completely in brainstem circuits. The condition of no cerebellum is not fatal on its own, but people born without cerebellar parts may experience severe developmental delays, language deficits and neurological abnormalities. Walking and talking in the case of no cerebellum may be delayed in the developmental phase of children until 4 to 7 years of age. Cerebellar agenesis may also be associated with low muscle tone resulting the lack of coordination in the learning transfer of motor knowledge. Some affected individuals may have difficulty in speaking usually due to problems with the muscles that enable speech production enhancement. The ability to speak is usually delayed in affected children, sometimes significantly. These two illustrations provide factual evidences that cerebellar learnography is very powerful in the learning transfer of knowledge chapters. In my opinion, the fast learning transfer and smart brainpage modulation of children are associated with the development of strong cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry. These students can finish the complete span (Taxshila Span) of K-1 to Master’s Degree approximately five years earlier in life, if cerebellar learnography is launched successfully in the classroom by using the knowledge transfer of brainpage theory. The ventricular system of brain anatomy is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and also important to understand the functions of learning circuits. The chapter brain of learning transfer is described by the posterior and anterior lateral ventricles. Why are these ventricles very large in shape and size? It’s important for the massive knowledge transfer of sensory and motor areas that takes place in the four regions of chapter brain. The inferior lateral ventricles and third ventricle of human brain are comparatively smaller in size which support the learning transfer of limbic brain. The fourth ventricle is found in the core brain of learnography that covers the functions of cerebellum and brainstem. Humans cannot develop the theories, methods and structures of science and technology without the power and precision of upper limb which is associated with the enhanced motor systems of cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry. The motor science of knowledge transfer is based on the studies of motor cortex and subcortical sites that include the basal ganglia, cerebellum and parts of brainstem. Give the students the scientific system and process of knowledge transfer in the classroom, not the teaching performance of motivation, instruction, cognition, demonstration and inspiration. Learning is knowledge transfer to human brain. Book is the transfer source of knowledge and student’s brain is the transfer target of learning. This is the universal law of school ecosystem in which the flow of knowledge transfer describes the mechanism of learning transfer. Learning is knowledge transfer considered as the first law of learnodynamics. Ability to acquire skill, knowledge and merit depends on the functional learnography of brain. It is hard to say that school teaching can change the plasticity of grey matter to run high speed learnogram. Everything happens in the classroom to provide high class teaching even distance learning classroom during pandemic. But only one thing does not happen that is knowledge transfer to student’s brain. Book to brain motor knowledge transfer is amazing in learning process. Smartphone is available everywhere in the world but smart brainpage is not modulated in schools to produce high performing students in the classroom. Change teaching classroom into brainpage classroom to develop the controlled environment of knowledge transfer to student’s brain in school ecosystem. Intelligence develops from the processing of motor knowledge. Space learnography, pathway learnography and motor learnography are the progressive aspects of book to brain knowledge transfer. Cerebellar learnography of student’s brain is very powerful in the learning transfer of knowledge chapters. In my opinion, the fast learning transfer and smart brainpage modulation of children are associated with the development of strong cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry. These students can finish the complete span (Taxshila Span) of K-1 to Master’s Degree approximately five years earlier in life, if cerebellar learnography is launched successfully in the classroom by using the knowledge transfer of brainpage theory. Happiness Classroom ! Book is the transfer source of knowledge and student’s brain is the transfer target of learning. To be high performing students, make brainpage in collaborative classroom by applying the seven dimensions of knowledge transfer. The motor science of knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom for the learning development and brainpage modules of Autistic or ADHD students. Let the students use motor knowledge to make smart brainpage in the classroom from book to brain direct learning transfer. The cyclozeid of knowledge transfer is rehearsed in the classroom to produce high speed zeidstream in the working mechanism of brain circuits. Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:

Brainpage – Learnography;"Home learning means to make brainpage at home by applying the motor knowledge of learning mechanism. Students are given homework to practice and make the brainpage of questions/answers at home. They are also very serious in making the brainpage of subject matter before exams and for this, book to brain knowledge transfer is practiced in brainpage making process. Actually, brainpage is the software module of learning transfer which is used in reading, writing and understanding. The teacher also makes brainpage before classroom performance and asks questions by using the brainpage module of chapter topics.  Everything is learnt in brain and everything is done by brain. This is the main theme of brain learnography that deals with the system of learning transfer in school system. The neuroscience of book to brain knowledge transfer should be focused in classroom operating system (CROS). Hence, the working mechanism of human brain is significant to the system of knowledge transfer that is introduced to produce high performing students in the classroom. And brainpage is the software of working mechanism to apply in reading, writing and understanding. Individuality is defined in physical body by the working circuits of human brain. The working mechanism of physical body is controlled and regulated by the different parts of brain. Therefore, the brain science of learning circuits must be focal point to provide high class academic performance in school system. It’s true that brainpage development is everything in the classroom for high performing students. The seven dimensions of school learnography are applied in book to brain knowledge transfer to make smart brainpage in the classroom during school hours. The knowledge transfer of learnography is categorized in three parts – cognition, emotion and intuition. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd dimensions of knowledge transfer are conducted for the development of cognitive learnography. The development of learning passion, working drives and emotional attachment comes from the application of 4th, 5th and 6th dimensions, known as limbic learnography. These dimensions are very important for higher abilities and behavioral changes. Motor learnography is defined in the 5th, 6th and 7th dimensions of knowledge transfer. These dimensions are important for high speed learning transfer and significant to the generation of big ideas and new discoveries. The advancement of intuitive knowledge is rehearsed in the zeidstream of motor science for the productive ideas, functional creativity and structural innovation of high technology. Teaching won’t be necessary in the structural and functional classroom for learning and understanding if definition spectrum is properly modulated in the association cortices of kid’s brain during learning process and memory formation. The association areas of chapter brain (cerebral cortex) is highly developed and located in the forebrain. This is the large part of neocortex and the house of knowledge spectrum acquired in the learning transfer. In fact, definition spectrum is the first dimension of learning transfer which deals with the naming address and definition address of functional objects in brainpage modulating process. Zeid is the building block or unit object of subject matter formed by the encapsulation of naming address, functional behavior and definition address. Therefore, zeids are the fundamental objects of knowledge creation. The second dimension of knowledge transfer is defined by the insular learnography of human brain. This is the central hub of learning transfer for brainpage development. Question asking is simple but question formation is difficult in writing practice. Whole chapter is studied to make some sensible meaningful questions. Students are often suggested to read and learn the contents of subject matter but they may feel sudden fear while facing some academic questions. That is why, the insular system of brain heavily connected to amygdala circuitry is very important to understand the knowledge matrix of task querying. The question set of exercise is given in the last page of chapters. In learnography, the content of subject matter follows the exercise set of questions, just opposite to teaching theories. In fact, function matrix is the exploring dimension of learnography to induce learning drives and develop the standard of knowledge quality. Breaking process is launched in knowledge transfer to understand the segments of subject matter and it is defined as the differential learnography of brainpage theory. The prefrontal cortex of brain is center for the modulation of cognitive knowledge and rational thoughts. Whole knowledge is difficult in learning transfer but it is broken into segments or blocks to increase the efficiency of brainpage processing. In fact, the third dimension of knowledge transfer is block solver that improves the capacity of learning skill and knowledge application. It is useful in making the exact statements of solution and writing the right answers in the exams. The parahippocampal gyrus of temporal lobe is the home of hippocampus, the search engine of human brain. This is also the limbic part of brain system that plays vital roles in learning transfer and memory formation. In fact, hippo compass is the fourth dimension of knowledge transfer known as the search engine of learning mechanism. It helps to explore the objects, facts and events of subject matter by developing the modular brainpage of pathway learnography. Space navigation is important in brainpage making process to explore the possibilities of knowledge application and consolidate the facts, objects and instances in different memory faculties with spatial search compass. This is the fifth dimension of knowledge transfer defined by the visuo-motor learnography of cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry. It describes the building process of structural brainpage modules in the working mechanism of motor circuits. We know that all types of learning transfer are ultimately converted into the motor knowledge of brain mechanism. This is the main architecture of the learning mechanism of human brain. The cortical, limbic and motor functions of basal ganglia are crucial in learning process to prepare the complete curated set of knowledge structure through the excitatory and inhibitory pathways of thalamus. The higher abilities of learning mechanism are acquired by using module builder, the fifth dimension of brainpage theory. This is the integral learnography of knowledge transfer in which whole knowledge is defined in building process to make the complete structure of knowledge chapter. This is the sixth dimension of Einstein’s genius brain defined by the dorsal and ventral streams of visual learnography. Visual cortex should be well-developed in genius brain. Two pathways such as visual, parietal and prefrontal circuitry, and another visual, temporal and prefrontal circuitry, are very important in the processing of higher level learning transfer. Visual cortex is located in the posterior region of brain and very powerful in analysis, computation and pattern recognition. It deals with the vision or sight functions of knowledge templates and formulating faces in which formatting properties are analyzed in learning transfer to secure the possible reflections of what, how and where queries. This is the gateway to the world of new advanced ideas, creativity and innovation. In fact, task formator is the sixth dimension of learning mechanism dealing with the improvement of understanding abilities. The tool making design of science and technology has been derived from the computing power of visual cortex circuitry. This is the seventh dimension of Einstein’s genius brain defined by the visuo-spatial learnography (genius area) of precuneus, retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. The world of dark knowledge is located beyond the imagination of cognitive thoughts. Dark knowledge is the source of creativity, new ideas and innovation. This is the seventh dimension of knowledge transfer that deals with the unconscious factors of intuition, learning passion and working drives. Smart brainpage for learning, working and earning develops from the creativity, innovation and advanced intuitive ideas of dark knowledge. The theme of dark knowledge has been derived from the live and dynamic blackboard effect (LADBE) of classroom performance. Brainpage making process is simple in practice and modulation. Father teacher is the creator of source book, written for the knowledge transfer of students. First of all, the content of source page is uploaded to the brainpage of learning circuits by rehearsing 3 to 5 times on prefrontal-thalamic cyclozeid (repeat action). After that the book is closed and the content is written on the paper of motor zeidpage by extracting modules from the brainpage of learning transfer. In this way, students have to finish brainpage processing on the three types of pages such as sourcepage, brainpage and zeidpage. Home learning means to make brainpage at home by applying the motor knowledge of learning mechanism. Students are given homework to practice and make the brainpage of questions/answers at home. They are also very serious in making the brainpage of subject matter before exams and for this, book to brain knowledge transfer is practiced in brainpage making process. Actually, brainpage is the software module of learning transfer which is used in reading, writing and understanding. The teacher also makes brainpage before classroom performance and asks questions by using the brainpage module of chapter topics. Teachers are over stressed, burning out and facing the problems of massive workloads due to the ineffective system of classroom learning transfer. It’s amazing that whole world is trying to improve the techniques of teaching system but it reflects only default education in which the knowledge of subject matter is not transferred to student’s brain circuits. Technology is also working to develop the advanced methods of pedagogy but all efforts are going in vain. Why is training given to the teachers? Of course, they need an effective system of learning transfer for their students that will be prescribed for the learnography of collaborative classroom. Certainly, that won’t be the teaching system of default education. Students should be trained and skilled in the seven dimensions of knowledge transfer, especially for the chapters of mathematics. Book learning transfer goes to brain circuits, so the school system of knowledge transfer should be based on the neurological studies and learning mechanism of human brain. Insular brain (Zeid brain) is the central hub of learning transfer to modulate the brainpage of knowledge chapters through the working dimensions of student’s brain. Everything is learnt in brain and everything is done by brain. Hence, brain learnography is crucial to the learning transfer management system (LTMS) of collaborative classroom.

To finish whole education at the age of 20 years – Learnography;"Students are trained and skilled in the seven fields of school learnography to launch the brainpage theory of knowledge transfer in the classroom. Brainpage theory of student’s learnography is the neuroscience of knowledge transfer based on the working mechanism of brain circuits. Therefore, book to brain direct knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom instead of teaching performance.  Brain is the school of knowledge transfer that defines our humanity, ability and qualification. It makes us individuals what we are. Brain parts are responsible for the generation of language and thoughts, attention and memory, behavior and imagination. A classroom of small teachers is defined in school learnography to make high speed brainpage modules in book to brain learning transfer. Taxshila 2020 is the universal theory of knowledge transfer. Whole education, KG to master’s degree, should be finished at the age of 20 years. This is potentially fit age for working, productivity and earning. Learnography is the school of knowledge transfer in which the learning fields of brainpage theory are launched in the classroom like the workplace of knowledge transfer. Teaching is not necessary because students learn from source books by applying the working dimensions of brain circuits. Everything is finished in school hours and homework is not required for practice. Learning from teaching activities is the pedagogy of education system while learning from brainpage making process is the brainpage theory of school system. That is why book to brain knowledge transfer is focused in learnography. School is the place where knowledge transfer takes place for the development of student’s working brainpage. Whole education should be finished at the age of 20 years and also students must be free to work at the age of 20 years. We know that teaching is everything in school education and it is universal truth as the sun rises in the east. Students receive learning from teaching performance but the brainpage development of subject matter is not obtained in the classroom. Learning mechanism of brain doesn’t support teaching theories to transfer knowledge efficiently in the learning process of subject chapters. Teachers are making their own brainpage in school education but students are modulating their brainpage in school learnography. Learning from the brainpage of knowledge transfer is the universal theory of school ecosystem. It is fact that knowledge transfer involves the application of previously learned knowledge while students are completing tasks or solving problems in the classroom. Motor science is related to the neurological studies of motor circuits of human brain but it also deals with the school of knowledge transfer for high performing students. Brain learnography brings changes in plasticity to transfer skill, understanding and subject matter for the improvement of working capabilities and future building factors. Cerebellar learnography is the ultimate learning of knowledge chapters. Functions of amygdala and hippocampus have been discovered in the field of neurological studies. Thus, brainpage theory of knowledge chapters is everything in the classrooms of school learnography. Brainpage development is everything in the classroom that produces high performing students in school ecosystem. Home learning means to make brainpage at home by applying the motor knowledge of learning mechanism. Students are given homework to practice and make the brainpage of questions/answers at home. They are also very serious in making the brainpage of subject matter before exams and for this, book to brain knowledge transfer is practiced in brainpage making process. Actually, brainpage is the software module of learning transfer which is used in reading, writing and understanding. The teacher also makes brainpage before classroom performance and asks questions by using the brainpage module of chapter topics. Pencil power is the motor finger mapping of brain learnography that facilitates the advancement of knowledge chapters in the field of science and technology. Students are trained and skilled in the seven fields of school learnography to launch the brainpage theory of knowledge transfer in the classroom. Brainpage theory of student’s learnography is the neuroscience of knowledge transfer based on the working mechanism of brain circuits. Therefore, book to brain direct knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom instead of teaching performance. Happiness Classroom ! Book is the transfer source of knowledge and student’s brain is the transfer target of learning. To be high performing students, make brainpage in collaborative classroom by applying the seven dimensions of knowledge transfer. The motor science of knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom for the learning development and brainpage modules of Autistic or ADHD students. Let the students use motor knowledge to make smart brainpage in the classroom from book to brain direct learning transfer. The cyclozeid of knowledge transfer is rehearsed in the classroom to produce high speed zeidstream in the working mechanism of brain circuits. Taxshila 2020 My daughter wants to get her high school equivalence at 15 or 16 and get into college right away so she can finish college young. We’ve been homeschooling for years now and it’s getting closer and closer to becoming a reality 🙂 LikeLiked by 2 people It’s reality that brainpage development is focused in homeschooling. I am very glad to know about the success of your daughter. She will certainly finish her education at early age. Thanks ! Be happy.

Role of phase superior in personalized knowledge transfer – Learnography;"Book to brain direct knowledge transfer is conducted in happiness classroom by the cyclozeid of sourcepage, brainpage and zeidpage. This is the brainpage theory of book to brain transfer and teaching is not necessary in the classroom. The learning mechanism of brain is mainly based on the neuroscience of insular system and cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry but it is not followed in cognitive school system.  Collaborative classroom is divided into the seven groups of students to focus personalized knowledge transfer. Each group is formed by seven students and led by one miniature teacher (small teacher). Altogether there are (7×7+1), 50 students in the classroom including one phase superior. Miniature school runs on goal oriented task operation (GOTO) and the fundamental tasks of individual achievement are singular focus, knowledge transfer, brainpage development, pencil power and future workplace. Phase superior (small teacher) is trained in the seven fields of school learnography. This teamwork is formed to conduct book to brain knowledge transfer in the collaborative classroom and does not interfere in the functions of school’s administration. The head of miniature teachers in a structured classroom is phase superior that is a student qualified and skilled in leadership, teamwork and brainpage modulation. He manages the system integration of learnography and looks out the administration of classroom performance. The phase superior makes seven groups in the classroom and appoints seven miniatures to lead each group of the students. The collaborative team of seven miniature teachers constitutes the basic design of knowledge transfer in the happiness classroom of School 2020. Seven miniatures are reported to their phase superior but all the phase superiors are reported to the superior general of school learnography. The selection of superior general is decided by the principal’s office on the basis of high academic performance from the topmost class of the institution. The principal also appoints phase superiors on the basis of singular focus, pencil power and brainpage modulation. The superior general acts as the coordinator of phase superiors to develop high performing classrooms and is also reported to the principal. The core team of happiness classroom is formed by a group of three small teachers (skilled students). They are phase superior (class head), class operator (first miniature) and system modulator (second miniature). Other five members of happiness classroom are the subject heads of classroom, skilled in the learning dimensions of knowledge transfer. Matrix book, spectrum book and five source books are launched in the classroom by class operator, system modulator and five subject heads respectively. They are responsible to conduct the brainpage processing of book to brain learning transfer to produce high performing students in the classroom. Seven miniature schools of happiness classroom can create the environment of learning transfer for the classroom operating system (CROS) of brainpage school. Phase superior is the head of happiness classroom and it is formed by the teamwork of seven small teachers (skilled students). They are operator, modulator and five subject heads. Class operator (M11) assists the subject moderator (big teacher) to create the environment of learning development (ELD) in the classroom and system modulator (M21) scrutinizes the quality control of brainpage learning. In fact, class operator is assistant to subject moderator and phase modulator is qualified in the implementation of motor science and brainpage theory. Subject head becomes active in specific period to launch the modulation of topics in classroom learnography, but the other four subject heads perform the work of opposition learning forces for updates and improvements. If a miniature is absent in happiness classroom, the phase superior will take his place and launch the brainpage modulation of concerned chapter. The collaboration of miniature schools can explain the system integration of learning science. In fact, it may help students to become leading persons in the learnography of mathematics, science, research, technology, business or politics. Teaching system of education is the MS-DOS of classroom operating system (CROS), while learnography is the Windows System of book to brain direct knowledge transfer. All the students of a country will be produced as science graduates, the key source of future workforce. Book to brain direct knowledge transfer is conducted in happiness classroom by the cyclozeid of sourcepage, brainpage and zeidpage. This is the brainpage theory of book to brain transfer and teaching is not necessary in the classroom. The learning mechanism of brain is mainly based on the neuroscience of insular system and cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry but it is not followed in the cognitive model school system of global education.

Pencil power brings remarkable changes in the structure and function of student’s brain regions – Learnography;"Knowledge transfer and pencil power of school system must be efficient and productive to provide learnography, food, houses, jobs and medicine for the livelihood of people. Learning without physical activities is useless and non-functional in the knowledge transfer of classroom. Neuroscience describes that the learning efficiency of cognitive and academic studies improves by the motor knowledge of physical activities.  Physical activity brings remarkable changes in the structure and function of brain regions. Academic learning of the classroom can be converted into the processing of motor knowledge through physical activities during the learning process of knowledge transfer. Hence, students must be physically active in classroom and involve in learning process by using the learning dimensions of brain learnography. Motor knowledge can promote plasticity in the learning regions of brain by improving executive functions, cognitive ability and memory formation. Pencil power is the most important knowledge tool to change the world of science and technology with creativity, innovation and high academic success. It develops from the finger mapping knowledge transfer (FMKT) of school system. Book to brain direct learning must be launched in classroom to use pencil power for high achievement. Pencil power is observed during skill development and it is an important tool in knowledge transfer. Education is a school system that deals with the teaching theories of knowledge chapters. But learnography is a branch of neuroscience which deals with the brainpage theory of knowledge transfer in school system. We can conclude that the pencil power of working mechanism is the finger mapping of brain learnography that writes the advancement of knowledge chapters in science and technology. Learnography is a new frontier of applied neuroscience. The pencil power of learning skill is provided in learnography while listening power develops from educational teaching. It is fact that the pencil power of knowledge transfer comes from brainpage development and motor finger mapping. This is the world of creativity, innovation and advancement. The pencil power of brainpage theory returns the advancement of science and technology. System of direct school explains that knowledge segments are uploaded to brain circuits from the source page of knowledge transfer and modular brainpage is prepared to process on the cyclozeid of brain-part thalamus for rehearsing and understanding. Teaching performance is an easy process of the classroom but it activates working mechanism of the teacher’s brain circuits. Student’s brain is motivated only to listening and watching. Learning brain doesn’t observe any physical activities and remains in passive mode. What type of neuroscience is running in the teaching theories of education system? Knowledge transfer of subject learning is most effective when practice sessions run in proper learning environment with physical movement to replicate target skill level and context for the performance of pencil power. This mechanism of brain circuits is efficient to launch pencil potentials and productive knowledge transfer in classroom learning by applying the brainpage theory and dimensions of learnography. Parents believe that the sweet fruit of skill, knowledge and merit is the high earning job of working learnodynamics. Obviously, learning outcome and pencil power are tested at workplace. Most people can’t make a good paragraph to express their feelings, emotions and thoughts. Writing inefficiency can be observed on interactive social media. In fact, good writing requires the standard quality of pencil power and high speed modular brainpage. Teaching science of knowledge transfer is running in classroom, but no room for learning science. Then homework is given to students so learning science runs at home to develop the pencil power of brain. The motor circuit of knowledge transfer provides pencil power in learning process. Writing page or procedural activity is the finger mapping of brainpage imaging and cognitive thinking. In fact, pencil power is the finger mapping of brain learnography that writes the advancement of knowledge chapters in science and technology. We must have good working habits to keep the good health of our brain and body. The proverb “Slow and steady wins the race” emphasizes the problem of over hastiness. Even a person with average talent can achieve great success in life through goal oriented focus and persistent effort. This is pencil power race of the Tortoise and the Hare. Knowledge transfer and pencil power of school system must be efficient and productive to provide learnography, food, houses, jobs and medicine for the livelihood of people. Learning without physical activities is useless and non-functional in the knowledge transfer of classroom. Neuroscience describes that the learning efficiency of cognitive and academic studies improves by the motor knowledge of physical activities.

Transformation of Motor Knowledge – Learnography;"Motor science is the backbone of brainpage school while cognitive science can provide talking schools in the name of high class teaching and quality education. In reality, teaching is not necessary in school system. The working mechanism of human brain is significant to the system of knowledge transfer. Teaching mechanism is not effective in the classroom for the brainpage development of knowledge spectrum. In learnography, motor science provides high speed learning transfer to make smart brainpage in the classroom.  Posture means an intentionally or habitually assumed position in working, learning or standing. We know that bearing refers to the manner of posture as well as the motor dynamics of gestures and other aspects of the conduct taking place in body, brain and behavior. I have watched many international speakers who deliver the motivational cognitive lecture by exhibiting different postures and body language, motorized hand and head gestures. It’s amazing that speaker’s lips speak, fingers speak, eyes speak, face reflects emotional translation and neck muscles describe specific ideas during performance. This is a salient evidence that cerebellum circuit translates motor knowledge into related subject matter to show the learnography of the speaker’s thoughts and ideas. In fact, cerebellum translates relative motor knowledge into corresponding academic or cognitive knowledge to demonstrate the working mechanism of brain. It also helps us to coordinate our thoughts in much the same way it helps us to coordinate our movements. It is obvious that the cerebellar learnography of student’s brain helps to decrease the academic period of knowledge transfer in learning process. In addition to this period, learning efficiency also improves by the working mechanism of cerebellar learnography. Everything is learnt in brain and everything is done by brain. This is the main theme of school learnography. The working mechanism of student’s brain is significant to the school system of knowledge transfer. And brainpage module is the software of working mechanism to apply motor science in reading, writing and understanding. Cerebellum is a structure of hind brain that usually contains about half of the brain’s total neurons. Jonathan was born without cerebellum and he was suffering from many learning disorders. This exceedingly rare condition has left him with a distinctive way of speaking and a walk that is slightly awkward. For the first few years of childhood, the learning milestones of motor knowledge were late and his future looked highly uncertain. Standing up, walking, running and talking all physical abilities were not developed at right time. So Jonathan got special education, speech therapy and also physical therapy. His father even decided some training for walk and managed a sort of beach therapy for Jonathan. He doesn’t really show initiatives in talking behavior and can’t get into the deeper level of conversation. We know that interactive attitude requires cognitive ability that builds strong connection which is necessary for deep enduring friendships. Once Jonathan faced a great problem when he was driving a car. There was a bus behind him, cars whizzing by and his brain simply couldn’t coordinate all the information. So, he totaled his father’s car and got a reminder of this at a busy intersection soon after he got his driver’s license. It is fact that he was lack of cerebellum and motor knowledge was not translated into rational knowledge to handle the critical situations of road traffic and car driving. A woman in China was also found that she was born with no cerebellum. She apparently started walking late at age of seven years. She walks unsteadily as an adult and has slurred speech. It’s amazing that she is able to walk and talk at all. She is fully oriented and married with a daughter. There was mild intellectual impairment on her behavior but word comprehension was normal and she had a normal sense of time and place. Fast learning is impossible without cerebellar learnography because brainpage making process might retard in the absence of motor translation. Jonathan and this woman both started walking and talking late by five years. It means that learning efficiency depends on cerebellar learnography. We can also reduce the total academic period of complete education by five years if cerebellar learnography is launched successfully in the classroom. In this way, the learning efficiency of students and total period of school and university education can be managed effectively by enhancing the motor knowledge and brainpage theory of knowledge transfer. Knowledge, understanding, application and higher ability are the four main merits of academic performance. These merits are the modifications of motor knowledge acquired during the academic learning of school courses. It is believed that cognitive ability and rational thoughts develop from the classroom teaching of school system. But the ultimate learning of knowledge chapters is high class motor knowledge that will help to achieve excellence in exams or to get a workplace for good earning job. Learning chapters of mathematics, science, technology and literature all are known as the academic knowledge of students and it should be converted to the motor knowledge of cerebellar learnography for higher performance. Chapters are taught in classroom but quality education is evaluated on the basis of questions asked in exams. Listening of teaching performance can’t transform academic knowledge into the cerebellar motor knowledge of our children to face hard questions with the procedural knowledge of space and time. This is main neurological concept that cognitive, emotional, rational and intuitive chapters are processed and stored separately in the cortical and subcortical parts of student’s brain. But these learning chapters must be converted into the smart brainpage of motor knowledge. Our kids have advanced motor systems in their brain such as motor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Knowledge is motorized in the three parts of brain. The motor cortex of frontal lobe is the first part of brain to translate academic knowledge into motor knowledge. The second part is subcortical basal ganglia where procedural motor knowledge is defined by target, space and navigation. Finally it goes to cerebellum for the modulation of enhanced motor knowledge. Use of tools, time and fire is a great evidence for the advanced cerebellar learnography of human brain. This cerebellum of brain is connected with the entire central nervous system through millions of connections. It influences all of our cortical functioning and output. This is the part of hind brain and it has a particular influence on motor functions. Cerebellum receives information about our muscles and joint positions. It also deals with propioceptive information, balance or vestibular information as well as vast connections to and from the cerebral cortex of human brain. This makes cerebellum the coordinator and predictor of cortical output. It is responsible for the sort of quality control and constant error correction. The knowledge of mathematics, science and technology is transformed into motor knowledge during learning process. Cerebellum translates relative motor knowledge into corresponding academic or cognitive knowledge to demonstrate the working mechanism of brain. It also helps us to coordinate our thoughts in much the same way it helps us to coordinate our movements. The knowledge transfer of machine learning also comes from the enhancement of motor knowledge. In fact, cerebellar learnography helps to decrease the academic period of knowledge transfer. The learning efficiency of student’s brain also improves by the working mechanism of cerebellar learnography. I have watched many international speakers who deliver the lecture by exhibiting body language and hand gestures. It’s amazing that speaker’s lips speak, fingers speak, eyes speak, face reflects emotional translation and neck muscles describe specific ideas during presentation. This is a salient evidence of motivation to grab the attention of audience in which cerebellum circuit translates motor knowledge into related subject matter to show the learnography of the speaker’s thoughts and ideas. The cerebellum of brain does not initiate movement but contributes to coordination, precision and accurate timing. It receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain and integrates these inputs to fine-tuned motor activity. In humans, cerebellum plays an important role in motor control and it may also be involved in some cognitive and rational functions such as attention, prediction and language. Emotion is coordinated in regulating fear and pleasure responses but its movement related functions have been well established because of motor knowledge processing. The smart brainpage of solutions will produce high performing students in the classroom of high speed learning transfer. In fact, the dimension of module builder launches the solution building process of chapter tasks in the collaborative classroom. The cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry of human brain describes the visuo-motor learnography of knowledge transfer which is very powerful to reflect positive changes in the attitude and behavior of student’s brain. Book to brain motor knowledge transfer is amazing in learning process. Change teaching classroom into brainpage classroom to develop the controlled environment of knowledge transfer to student’s brain in school ecosystem. Happiness Classroom ! Book is the transfer source of knowledge and student’s brain is the transfer target of learning. To be high performing students, make brainpage in collaborative classroom by applying the seven dimensions of knowledge transfer. The motor science of knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom for the learning development and brainpage modules of Autistic or ADHD students. Let the students use motor knowledge to make smart brainpage in the classroom from book to brain direct learning transfer. The cyclozeid of knowledge transfer is rehearsed in the classroom to produce high speed zeidstream in the working mechanism of brain circuits. Very useful information as a Speaker . . . knowing that what is driving my physical gestures is related to how the listener receives/interprets them. LikeLiked by 1 person It’s absolutely true ! I have studied the neuroscience of high performing international speakers and it supports the transformation of motor knowledge into the physical gestures of effective performance. For instance, bending head toward left side increases blood flow in the left hemisphere of brain showing the tendency of relaxation or fun. But bending head toward right side reflects the state of seriousness. In the same way, strong gestures maintain blood flow in the speech centers of frontal and temporal lobes. It is fact that motor cortex needs good supply of blood to keep the fluency, articulation and pitch of voice. Pointing index finger increases blood supply in prefrontal cortex showing emphasis. Every gesture has specialized meaning in the anatomy of human brain. The most important fact of physical gestures is focus which develops from the transformation of motor knowledge. A speaker keeps focus on the audience through the motor science of physical activities. In education system, teachers are showing the transformation of motor knowledge in the classroom and students are deprived of motor knowledge in learning process. They keep listening and watching for 12 years in school system. High class teaching is provided in the institution but nothing is transferred to student’s brain. Thanks for valuable comments
Be happy and stay safe.

Taxshila Model – Learnography;"Primary school system deals with the development of the motor cortex of student’s brain known as motor learnography. Secondary school system is designed to develop the proficiency of object language in the basal ganglia regions of brain known as basal learnography. High level learning transfer occurs in university knowledge transfer system known as cerebellar learnography. Students make brainpage modules in the learning process of classroom using the cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry of core brain.  Taxshila Span (545) describes school learnography of 15 years for complete knowledge transfer. Primary learnography takes five years of the academic span and the period of four years is given to the secondary learnography of knowledge transfer. The graduation of university learnography is completed in five years’ time span, such as three years’ bachelor degree and two years’ master degree. One year is arranged for the apprenticeship of workforce skill development program considered as the third year of master’s degree. Kindergarten level should be finished before the age of five years. Cognitive science of the teaching theories may finish whole education at the age of about 30 years while the motor science of knowledge transfer can secure complete education at the age of 20 years. In this way, an individual can complete the graduation of university course at the age of 20 years and will be transformed into the small teacher of Taxshila Model. In fact, the core academy of School 2020 runs on the knowledge transfer of science courses, therefore, the whole workforce of a country will be produced as the science graduates of school ecosystem. There are five fundamental themes of the knowledge transfer categorized in school learnography such as kindergarten course, foundation course, culture course, proficiency course and specialization course. The time period of knowledge transfer from kindergarten to master’s degree is defined as Taxshila Span (1+2+3+4+3+2+1) which will be completed at the age of 20 years. The time pattern of taxshila span is described as kindergarten 1 year, foundation 2 years, culture 3 years, proficiency 4 years, bachelor’s degree 3 years, master’s degree 2 years and apprentice 1 year. School learnography is always focused on the brainpage theory of motor science based on the learning circuits, anatomical facts and functional findings of neurological studies. There are three main levels of the knowledge transfer in the academic system of School 2020 such as primary learnography, secondary learnography and university learnography. The distribution of time period may be arranged in the following taxshila design such as Primary – 5 years, Secondary – 4 years and University – 5 years. One year is provided for apprenticeship. In this way, the total period of time required is 15 years span for the complete knowledge transfer of student’s master learnography. It’s amazing that the average span of modern education is very long, more than the period of 20 years and it lasts till the age of 25 years to 30 years. One of the bloggers wrote, “If students finish complete education at the age of 20 years and achieve mental, financial and living freedom, it is very likely that they will be able to create new innovations, establish great projects and manufacture good things in building the future.” Primary learnography consists of two parts – foundation course and culture course. Foundation course is the first part of primary learnography and it takes two years to practice and apply the first and second dimensions of knowledge transfer. The period of 3 years is provided for culture course to focus on the third dimension of learnography. Primary children have unique behavior to explore and learn new things. These dimensions can direct subject contents in making the brainpage of matrix and spectrum for smart learning transfer. The third dimension of brainpage theory will promote the block learnography from worked out examples in which the mirror neurons of student’s brain will emulate objects, formats and methods to develop the speed and techniques of book to brain direct knowledge transfer. The collaboration of miniature schools has been designed for the learnography of Taxshila School. Adolescence is the period of children’s physical and mental development following the onset of puberty during which a young person develops from a limbic child into a cognitive adult. This is the transitional stage of physical, limbic and cognitive development that generally occurs during the period of biological changes from puberty to adulthood maturity. Taxshila School is the core academy of proficiency small teachers for the age group of 10-14 years (pre-adolescence). The core academy of knowledge transfer means the learnography of five core subjects such as biology, chemistry, innovation, mathematics and physics. Secondary learnography is the core academy of Taxshila Model. It deals with the proficiency course of knowledge transfer and it takes four years to finish this level by applying the 4th, 5th and 6th dimensions of brainpage theory. University learnography deals with the professional as well as specialization courses of work learnography and these classrooms are conducted on the 5th, 6th and 7th dimensions of knowledge transfer. The first part of university learnography runs for the bachelor’s degree and the period of 3 years is given to finish undergraduate courses. And the period of 2 years is suitable for the master’s degree and one year is provided for the apprenticeship of post-graduate courses. Hence, the academic performance of students from school to university will be completed at the age of 20 years and the workforce of young brains will be ready to join hands in the progress of national economy. Weekly doctoral camp runs thrice in a year as the open source platform of small teachers under the guidance of PhD Moderators. It may be arranged in the university to conduct research work and thesis writing for Specialization and PhD degree. We must realize that the working life of our children can’t be sacrificed in the name of higher specialized academic degrees. They will be successful to achieve doctoral degree while working and earning. The middle section of school system is not necessary in the brainpage school of Taxshila Model. Actually, this is the taxshila design of school system in which brainpage is modulated for book to brain knowledge transfer and the learning mechanism of brain is applied to increase the understanding efficiency of knowledge chapters. Learning from teachers and learning from brainpage modulation both are different approaches in school system. School learnography is not school education. It deals with the science of learning mechanism to prepare the brainpage modules of knowledge chapters in the classroom. The learnography of book to brain knowledge transfer can draw the sketch of pathways that leads to the destiny of progressive working life. Education and work are the two basic phases of human life. Education takes long span of time and work is the necessity of livelihood. It’s not easy to find a good job even after completing specific degree in the university. Sometimes it is observed that work becomes more important than education. Students can’t complete the particular course of university degree on time, so it takes extra years to achieve a degree in higher education. Thus, complete education takes about the period of 25 years. If students start primary education at the age of 5 years, they will finish university education most probably at the age of 30 years. Whole education and its total years are related to the progress of learning individuals. Higher education is expensive so academic expenses may go up with the increase in years. The calculation of academic time span shows primary 5 years, secondary 7 years, bachelor’s degree 4 years and master’s degree 3 years. In this way, total time span for complete education may be 19+1 years. So students may finish university degree at the age of 25 years. Doctoral degree may take 3 to five years and the years of kindergarten are not added in this span. In reality, it is difficult to predict the total period of time that the institutions may take to finish the complete education of our children. Workforce is essential for the growth and development of a country, so education must be complete at the age of 20 years. The working potentials and productive drives of human brain are observed very high between 20 to 30 years’ age. Working drives of the brain may be lost in the courses of higher education because university education is completed at the age of 30 years. Students are seen fighting to compete in the race of working and earning, however, education takes long span to provide academic degrees for progressive future and better placement. If students start schooling at the age of five years, whole education should be finished within the period of 15 years. Then they will be free to work at the age of 20 years. It’s true that the creativity, will power and working passion are found very high at the age of 20 years. Average active age span of 80 years can be calculated to describe the structural life of human beings. Age of 1-20 years is spent on the learning development of brain to achieve skill, knowledge and experience. Age of 20-60 years is suitable for the working and earning life of people. Retired age is 60-80 years and above 80 years, brain requires full care and rest for peaceful living. In this way, a person can manage the time span of his life like 15 years in knowledge learnography, 40 or 50 years at workplace and 20 years at home as the retired part of life. He will need extensive care and peaceful environment above 80 years of age, as cerebellar learnography begins to deteriorate and cognitive functions may decline because of brain’s shrinkage, poor memory and loss of gray matter. Primary school system deals with the development of the motor cortex of student’s brain known as motor learnography. Secondary school system is designed to develop the proficiency of object language in the basal ganglia regions of brain known as basal learnography. High level learning transfer occurs in university knowledge transfer system known as cerebellar learnography. In this way, the cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry of student’s brain is exercised in the classroom to modulate cognitive knowledge into motor knowledge for high speed learning transfer. Visuo-motor learnography develops from the fifth dimension of knowledge transfer which is projected in learning process by the cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry of core brain. It is essential for goal oriented task operation (GOTO) to achieve great success in problem solving activities. Understanding from the brainpage modules of knowledge transfer is the universal theory of school ecosystem. It is fact that knowledge transfer involves the application of previously learned knowledge while students are completing tasks or solving problems in the classroom. Happiness Classroom ! Book is the transfer source of knowledge and student’s brain is the transfer target of learning. To be high performing students, make brainpage in collaborative classroom by applying the seven dimensions of knowledge transfer. The motor science of knowledge transfer should be launched in the classroom for the learning development and brainpage modules of Autistic or ADHD students. Let the students use motor knowledge to make smart brainpage in the classroom from book to brain direct learning transfer. The cyclozeid of knowledge transfer is rehearsed in the classroom to produce high speed zeidstream in the working mechanism of brain circuits. Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:

Learnography – Book to brain knowledge transfer;"Biologically, learning is knowledge transfer to one’s brain regions. High class teaching is provided in the classroom but nothing is transferred to student’s brain circuits in listening and watching. Take an academic test just after teaching and you will find the truth that teaching is the waste of school hours. Actually, our brain is the school of knowledge transfer that defines our humanity, working ability and productive graduation. It makes us individuals what we are doing in our lives. Brain-parts are responsible for the generation of language and thoughts, attention and memory, behavior and imagination, and in this way for failure and success.  This is the school of knowledge transfer in which the learning fields of brainpage theory are launched in the classroom like the workplace of knowledge transfer. Teaching is not necessary because students learn from brainpage books by applying the mathematical dimensions of learning mechanism. Everything is finished in school hours, so homework is not required for learning and writing at home. A classroom of small teachers is defined in school learnography to make high speed brainpage modules in book to brain learning transfer. Transformation of motor knowledge runs on the cerebellar learnography of learning transfer. Whole education should be finished at the age of 20 years and also students must be free to work at the age of 20 years. That’s the theme of School 2020 ! A student may be transformed into a small teacher if he attains the singularity of zeid knowledge during brainpage memory modulation. Learning is knowledge transfer to student’s brain regions. All types of knowledge transfer are transformed into the single behavioral output of composite motor knowledge in the basal ganglia circuitry of student’s brain. This is the singularity of brainpage theory based on the fifth dimension of knowledge transfer. Children are intelligent in the motor science of knowledge transfer but they are bad in the application of cognitive science. In children, the motor circuits of brain are more developed than the logic and cognitive circuits of prefrontal cortex. Students should be allowed to make brainpage in the classroom using the motor science of knowledge transfer. Learnography is the school of knowledge transfer in which the learning fields of brainpage theory are launched in the classroom like the workplace of knowledge transfer using motor learning skills. Teaching is not necessary because students learn from spectrum book, matrix book and source books by applying the working dimensions of brain circuits. Everything is finished in school hours and homework is not required for parenting, memorizing and home learning. A classroom of small teachers is defined in school learnography to make high speed brainpage memory modules in book to brain learning transfer. Taxshila 2020 is the universal theory of knowledge transfer to be applied in school ecosystem. Whole education, KG to master’s degree, should be finished at the age of 20 years. This is potentially fit age for working, productivity and earning. Brainpage modular theory of kid’s learnography is the neuroscience of knowledge transfer based on the working mechanism of brain circuits that should be launched in the structural and functional classroom instead of pedagogical teaching performance. Learning from the contents, formats and methods of teaching activities is the pedagogy of education system. While learning from the brainpage making process of modulation, evolution and personalization is the brainpage theory of Taxshila Model School System. That is why book to brain knowledge transfer is focused in kid’s learnography. We know that teaching is everything in school education and it is universal truth as the sun rises in the east. Students receive learning from teaching performance but the brainpage development of subject matter is not obtained in the pedagogical classroom. The learning mechanism of student’s brain doesn’t support teaching theories to transfer knowledge efficiently in the learning process of subject chapters. Class learnography of student’s school system means goal-oriented task learning, concept writing in object language and making brainpage associaton modules in book to brain motor knowledge transfer. The homework of school culture is assigned to kids for the practice and learning of chapter tasks in home learning under parental guidance. It is fact that home is not an academic school and the parents are not professional teachers to help kids in learning process. Neuroscience has revealed important facts and findings about the learning and working mechanism of human brain. These facts and findings are not utilized in the pedagogical methods and classroom techniques of education. It is clear that pedagogy has been developed for the teacher’s working brain, not for the learning mechanism of student’s brain. Teachers are making their own brainpage modules in school education but students are modulating their brainpage personalization in the structural, functional and collaborative classrooms of school learnography. Cerebellar learnography of the kid’s brain is the ultimate learning transfer of knowledge chapters. The functions of amygdala and hippocampus have been widely discovered in the field of neurological studies. The amygdala circuitry of student’s brain is hijacked and hippocampus is blocked in the teaching system of education. These subcortical functions of student’s brain are activated to conduct knowledge transfer in the structural and functional classroom. Thus, the brainpage modular theory of book to brain direct knowledge transfer is everything in the miniature schools of classroom learnography. Knowledge learning is the first priority of school system. We do not care of learning skill needed to understand the subject matter of chapter. This is the skill of learnography to apply the dimensions of learning mechanism in thinking, processing and writing. Brain learnography brings changes in plasticity to transfer skill, understanding and subject matter for the improvement of working capabilities and future building factors. Motor science is related to the neurological studies of motor circuits of human brain but it also deals with the school of knowledge transfer for high performing students. Education depends on the teaching of courses while learnography comes from the practice of brainpage modulation. The architecture of brainpage is hidden in intuitive knowledge and smart learning is derived from the cyclozeid of brain working mechanism. High academic performance requires the smart brainpage of skill, knowledge and experience to get success in the advancement of science and technology. Requirements are well-defined space, task, time, voice and moderation to invite proper changes in aptitude, behavior and thinking. So the discipline of brainpage making is needed in classroom learnography. Brain defines our humanity. It makes us individuals what we are. It is responsible for the generation of language and thoughts, attention and memory, behavior and imagination. Brainpage theory of learnography is the neuroscience of knowledge transfer based on the working mechanism of brain circuits that should be launched in classroom instead of teaching performance. Students become small teachers to make brainpage in the learning transfer of mathematics. Training is not essential for teachers in learnography but students are trained in learning dimensions and brain mechanism to apply spectrum, matrix, block, compass, module, format and intuitive ideas in knowledge transfer. School 2020 is the concept of big teacher and small teacher in which the quality of big teacher is standard evaluation applied to observe the outcome of learning process. Learning must bring the standard quality of a teacher into student’s achievement through brainpage modulation and personalization. This is the brainpage theory of learning mechanism. Homework is not required and children may be free at home to finish other tasks. Brain science is practiced in learning process to maintain procedural and declarative methods. It can promote self-learning for confidence building but pedagogy always gives dependent learning and confidence building factor is lost in teaching. Brainpage school runs on the open source collaborative classroom of learning transfer management system (LTMS). We know that open and free learning transfer is better than the closed and controlled learning resources of classroom. It contributes to build miniature school in the structural, functional and collaborative classroom as a brainpage module development platform (BMDP) accessible to all students, moderators (teachers), parents and school principal. How is the place of knowledge transfer and brainpage learnography described in school ecosystem? Brainpage school promotes choice and transparency, and gives students and teachers more control over their teamwork performance, learning transfer system and brainpage making process. Obviously, open source structural, functional and collaborative classroom is the basic design of miniature school and zeid factors (learning passions and working drives) to launch the brainpage theory of knowledge transfer in school system. Drawbacks of Education System Biologically, learning is knowledge transfer to one’s brain regions. High class teaching is provided in the classroom but nothing is transferred to student’s brain circuits in listening and watching. Take an academic test just after teaching and you will find the truth that teaching is the waste of school hours. Actually, our brain is the school of knowledge transfer that defines our humanity, working ability and productive graduation. It makes us individuals what we are doing in our lives. Brain-parts are responsible for the generation of language and thoughts, attention and memory, behavior and imagination, and in this way for failure and success. Happiness Classroom !

School 2020 runs on the knowledge transfer of motor science, brainpage theory and learnodynamics – Learnography;"Our kids need the creative skills of pencil power for innovation and production to meet the requirements of working, earning and living. Whole education should be finished at the age of 20 years and also students must be free to work at the age of 20 years. December 20, 2020 is important day for School 2020 and Taxshila Model. The motor science of knowledge transfer can create high performing classrooms in school ecosystem.  Physical activity brings remarkable changes in the structure and function of brain regions. Academic learning of the classroom can be converted into the processing of motor knowledge through physical activities during the learning process of knowledge transfer. Hence, students must be physically active in classroom and involve in learning process by using the learning dimensions of brain learnography. Motor knowledge can promote plasticity in the learning regions of brain by improving executive functions, cognitive ability and memory formation. We must have good working habits to keep the good health of our brain and body. The proverb “Slow and steady wins the race” emphasizes the problem of over hastiness. Even a person with average talent can achieve great success in life through persistent effort. This is pencil power race of the Tortoise and the Hare. It is suggested that regular physical activity lasting for 40 minutes five times a week can improve sound mental health. The volume of gray matter in brain circuits increases from physical exercise. Students can also achieve good learnography of the knowledge transfer if learning in school is finished with physical activities like reading, writing, mapping or answering. All types of activities are found to improve mental health no matter people’s age or gender, including doing the housework and looking after the children. Exercise is already known to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Students need the creative skills of pencil power for innovation and production to meet the requirements of working, earning and living. From the regular rehearsals of physical activities, structural and functional improvements are observed in brain structures and pathways associated with cognitive control and memory formation. Physical activity means the processing of motor knowledge. The neurobiological effects of physical exercise are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated effects on the structure, function and cognition of brain parts. Motor knowledge of physical activities can induce neurogenesis (birth of new brain cells) and increase the volume of gray matter in hippocampus. It is associated with measurable improvements in spatial pathway memory and related cognitive functions for high speed knowledge transfer. Reviews of neuroimaging studies indicate that consistent aerobic exercise increases the volume of gray matter in nearly all regions of the brain. More pronounced increase in the volume of gray matter is occurring in brain regions associated with memory processing, cognitive control, motor function and reward factors. The most prominent gains in gray matter are seen in prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus, which support cognitive control and memory processing with other cognitive functions. The left and right halves of prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cingulate cortex appear to become more functionally interconnected in response to the consistent processing of motor knowledge. Higher grades and qualifying scores are associated with better executive function, faster information processing speed and the greater gray matter volume of hippocampus, caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens. Brainpage theory of knowledge transfer requires students’ initiatives in classroom with physical activities to activate the brain circuits of motor knowledge. Physical activity is also associated with persistent beneficial epigenetic changes that result in improved stress coping, improved cognitive function and increased neuronal activity like c-Fos and BDNF signaling. Pencil power develops from the motor knowledge of brain circuits. Brain structures that show the greatest improvements in the volume of gray matter in response to aerobic exercise are prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Less significant increase in the volume of gray matter occurs in anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum and nucleus accumbens. Prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex are among the most significant brain structures in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine systems that give rise to cognitive control. Learnography is a new branch of neuroscience which deals with the brain circuits of learning mechanism in the knowledge transfer of school system. Neuroplasticity is the process by which neurons adapt to a disturbance over time. It most often occurs in response to repeated exposure to stimuli. Aerobic exercise such as walking and running increases the production of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, IGF-1 and VEGF. These factors mediate improvements in cognitive functions and various forms of memory by promoting blood vessel formation in the brain, adult neurogenesis and other forms of neuroplasticity. Consistent aerobic exercise over a period of several months induces clinically significant improvements in the executive functions of brain. It also increases the volume of gray matter in nearly all regions of the brain, with the most marked development occurring in brain regions that give rise to executive functions. In healthy adults, aerobic exercise has been shown to induce transient effects on cognition after a single exercise session. But the persistent effect on cognition is observed by following regular exercise over the course of several months. People who regularly perform aerobic exercise such as running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming and cycling have greater scores on neuropsychological function and performance tests. Physical activity improves certain cognitive functions such as attentional control, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. It also enhances working memory, updating capacity, declarative memory, spatial memory, and information processing speed. The effects of exercise on cognition have important implications for improving academic performance in children and college students. It also helps in improving productivity at workplace, preserving cognitive function in old age, preventing or treating certain neurological disorders and improving overall quality of life. Research has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise such as 30 minutes per day induces persistent improvement in the cognitive functions of brain, healthy alteration in gene expression and beneficial forms of neuroplasticity as well as behavioral plasticity. Some of these long-term effects include increased neuron growth, increased neurological activity like c-Fos and BDNF signaling, improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control of behavior, improved declarative, spatial and working memories. Our kids need the creative skills of pencil power for innovation and production to meet the requirements of working, earning and living. Whole education should be finished at the age of 20 years and also students must be free to work at the age of 20 years. December 20, 2020 is important day for School 2020 and Taxshila Model. The motor science of knowledge transfer can create high performing classrooms in school ecosystem. In fact, the pencil power of knowledge transfer is crucial to brainpage development and effective learning in the classroom. It develops from the motor knowledge of student’s brain circuits. Learning without physical motor activities is useless and non-functional in the knowledge transfer of happiness classroom. Development of gray matter happens in the brain circuits of learning mechanism to launch motor plasticity for reading, writing and understanding.

Brain, body and behavior – Learnography;"Students will process book to brain knowledge transfer by applying the working dimensions of brain circuits. The motor science of cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry can project high speed learning transfer to make the smart brainpage of subject matter in the classroom.  A teacher uses motor knowledge in performance, so knowledge transfer goes to the teacher’s brain. If students apply motor knowledge in brainpage processing, learning transfer will go to student’s brain. This is the brainpage theory of motor science. Learning transfer to the student’s brain may not occur in the classroom if cognitive knowledge is not transformed into the motor knowledge of reading, writing and understanding. Brainpage school is the future of education in which students will modulate brainpage from book to brain knowledge transfer by applying the working dimensions of brain learnography. Feed student’s brain with motor science of knowledge transfer, focus the goal-oriented action of physical body and fix the reactance of kid’s well-defined behavior to develop happiness classrooms in school ecosystem. Motor science deals with the functional connectivity and neural projections of brain, body and behavior. Cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry regulates all our learning activities in brain, coordinates all our physical movements of the body, and finally converges all our knowledge transfer into one working behavior. It also provides therapeutic values for the effective treatment of many mental disorders. All our cortical outputs of learning transfer are integrated in the basal ganglia of limbic brain to activate cerebellar circuitry with respect to space, object and time. None of these basal ganglia loops such as association, limbic and motor loops works independently for learning transfer. Everything is needed in cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry to know right module and feel comfortable in order to have perfect performance in learning transfer. The group of basal ganglia is like a conical funnel that takes all our activities of knowledge transfer with learning passion, general mood and working drives, and results in one behavioral output of the goal oriented task operation (GOTO). All our cortical activities of learning transfer are consolidated as brainpage modules in the association areas of chapter brain. One circuit is primarily involved in the integration of motor output and another circuit plays a major role in learning and cognition. And finally, a third circuit regulates the emotional aspect of behaviour to project zeid factors for the induction of learning passion and working drives. Caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus are the four main nuclei of basal ganglia and other two associated structures are substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Cerebellum is an important part of core brain coordinating cognitive, limbic and motor functions to develop smart brainpage in knowledge transfer. Cognitive knowledge must be transformed into motor knowledge in school system. Education runs on cognitive science in classroom, but motor science is described at workplace to manufacture competitive products for the market. Students will process book to brain knowledge transfer by applying the working dimensions of brain circuits. The motor science of cerebellar basal ganglia circuitry can project high speed learning transfer to make the smart brainpage of subject matter in the classroom. Taxshila 2020 Visual and hands on learners miss out on virtual learning settings since many of them may not be auditory learners. I agree with year earlier assessment that putting pencil to paper is essential for young learners. It is so necessary for eye hand co-ordination just like coloring is for preschool and primary students.
Dwight LikeLiked by 1 person Eye-hand coordination is known as the visuo-motor learnography of knowledge transfer and it is carried out by the cerebellar basal ganglia motor circuitry of student’s brain.

Data Scientists Break Down the AI Universe;Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet! 04/27/2021 Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will undoubtedly shape the course of technology across fields ranging from health care to self-driving cars to financial investing. Data scientists and statisticians remain the oft-unsung heroes of the AI boom as they play a key role in extracting insights from complex datasets to design the algorithms and data processing methodologies that – put simply – make AI more intelligent. But what draws someone to data science in the first place? Is a childhood love of math enough to drum up dreams of data mining and analysis?  Probably not. “If you talk to middle school kids and ask them what they want to do when they grow up, surprisingly, nobody [would raise] their hand and say, ‘Data scientist!’ It’s not necessarily on their radar,” said Delfi Diagnostics co-founder and Head of Data Sciences Robert Scharpf during a recent webinar hosted by the University of Maryland’s Biocomputational Engineering degree program. “I started out more in traditional biology in basic science research and became more interested in data analysis than in laboratory experiments that were used to generate the data. And, that led me to a biostatistics program.”  Delfi Diagnostics is a Baltimore-based company committed to developing high-performing, affordable blood tests for early detection of cancer across multiple tumor types. Delfi’s technology utilizes low-cost, widely available sequencing technology and taps cell-free DNA fragments in the bloodstream for clues about whether a person may have early-stage cancer. As manager of biomedical engineering & sciences at Exponent Christie Bergerson described in the same event – artificial intelligence represents the wider universe, and machine learning a portion of that universe. “Machine learning can be what’s considered supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised depending on the algorithms,” she said. “‘Unsupervised learning’ is where you let the algorithm find patterns for itself, and it’s potentially the scariest because it is the least controlled. But, it is also potentially the most useful because computers see things differently than humans. They have access to different data points.” Want to learn more about how Drs. Scharpf and Bergerson describe the future of AI in health care? Watch the full webinar online. For those looking to branch into the world of AI and machine learning, a degree that merges biology, data science, and programming could be the gateway. “The foundations of machine learning have their roots in statistics and computer science,” Bergerson said. “I encourage people to think beyond their bachelor’s degree about what would present them with the most opportunities for collaboration and mentorship from faculty – such as [deciding between] in-person and online programs. [Students in the latter] might miss out on those opportunities.” If you’re interested in enrolling in a program that could set you on the path to a career in AI, the University of Maryland’s Biocomputational Engineering B.S. degree program may be the perfect fit for you!  By enrolling in this cutting-edge program, you’ll work toward your University of Maryland bachelor’s degree while studying at The Universities at Shady Grove campus – home to the new, state-of-the-art Biomedical Sciences and Engineering Education Facility.

How are deep learning and neural networks used to analyze marine biology data? - Actu IA;"Quebec researchers have harnessed artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning, to better understand the diet of the Northern Gannet, a seabird native to the North Atlantic. They connected a miniature camera, a GPS and a dive recorder to some of the animals in Bonaventure Island and Rocky Mountain National Park. These three tools allowed them to obtain precise information on the marine animals.
 How can we speed up the detection and identification of the fish that appear in the astronomical quantities of video images captured by the cameras attached to gannets? This is the central problem of the research project by David Pelletier, researcher and teacher at the Cégep de Rimouski, Pauline Martigny, doctoral student at the same Cégep, Magella Guillemette, researcher at the Université du Québec à Rimouski, and Olivier Leclerc, computer scientist at the Centre de développement et de recherche en intelligence numérique (CDRIN) in Matane. Their project is called “Digital Gannet” and its objective is to capture gannets, Europe’s largest seabird, and then attach a miniature camera, a GPS and a dive recorder to these animals. All of this equipment weighs a maximum of 75 grams. Each has a task to perform: After installing these devices, the researchers release the birds, leave them in captivity for 24 hours and then recapture them to remove the devices, which will then be placed on other individuals. With this method, the researchers hope to follow about 60 gannets with their five cameras. With eight hours of recordings per camera and sixty birds, that’s 480 hours of potential film to analyze. This is a huge amount of video that will have to be analysed, and this is where artificial intelligence comes into play. Working with Olivier Leclerc, the researchers were able to develop an artificial neural network capable of recognizing five species of fish eaten by gannets: mackerel, herring, capelin, sand lance and redfish. This neural network first had to be trained to enable the computer to recognize fish in images. This training was done by presenting the algorithm with thousands of images first labelled by an expert, who had previously indicated the elements corresponding to the fish to be recognised and the species to which it belongs. Isabelle Cayer, executive director of CDRIN, gives more details on how the deep learning model works: “The person annotating must be an expert who knows how to recognize the distinctive characteristics of species. [The machine must learn, for example, that the fin of one species is sharper than that of another. For example, the machine will mathematically discover that mackerel with black and blue stripes on their backs have alternative patterns of black and blue: the algorithm creates analysis rules like that for itself, which it will then apply in other photos.”
 To retrieve all the data needed to train the neural network, David Pelletier installed cameras in aquariums at the Exploramer museum in Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, obtained data sets on redfish in the Maurice Lamontagne Institute’s tanks and photos of mackerel from fishermen on the docks. He says that his network is accurate eight times out of ten at the moment and that the task for him is not easy because the fish move quickly and when the bird dives, it creates broth, a multitude of small air bubbles that the tool can interpret as fish. With these three devices and artificial intelligence to analyze all of the data collected, the research team hopes to improve their model to fill in some of the gaps in studying lesser-known fish.

 You have full access to this article via your institution.  Accepting a Nobel prize nearly two decades ago, my old friend Sydney Brenner had a warning for biology. “We are drowning in a sea of data and starving for knowledge,” he said. That admonishment, from one of the founders of molecular biology, who established the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, is even more relevant to biology today. Rather often, I go to a research talk and feel drowned in data. Some speakers seem to think they must unleash a tsunami of data if they are to be taken seriously. The framing is neglected, along with why the data are being collected; what hypotheses are being tested; what ideas are emerging. Researchers seem reluctant to come to biological conclusions or present new ideas. The same occurs in written publications. It is as if speculation about what the data might mean and the discussion of ideas are not quite ‘proper’. I have a different view: description and data collection are necessary but insufficient. Ideas, even tentative ones, are also needed, along with the recognition that ideas will change as facts and arguments accumulate. 

Life’s code script
 Life’s code script Why are researchers holding back on ideas? Perhaps they are worried about proposing an idea that turns out to be wrong, because that might damage their chances of getting promotion or funding. But as Charles Darwin put it: “False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path towards error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened.” To wit, it’s important to get the facts right, but new ideas are useful, as long as they are based on reasonable evidence and are amenable to correction. Don’t get me wrong. We need data produced from new technologies to advance understanding. The importance of ’hypothesis-free research’ is well established: the philosopher Francis Bacon proposed it as part of his ‘empirical method’ in 1620. In his book Novum Organum, he argued that the first step in establishing scientific truth should be the description of facts through systematic observations. But this is only the first step. For example, it would have been rather a pity if Darwin had stopped thinking after he had described the shapes and sizes of finch beaks, and had not gone on to propose the idea of evolution by natural selection. The next step is to extract knowledge from the data. To refocus on that goal, we must improve our working processes, placing a greater emphasis on theory and shifting our research culture. 

Better methods can’t make up for mediocre theory
 Better methods can’t make up for mediocre theory How? Embed engineers and experimentalists who are developing new technologies and methods deeply into the biological problems. It is through deep familiarity with the biology — not simply a drive to collect more and more data — that important questions will be asked. Such questions will sustain the investigators’ passion to keep probing data until patterns and knowledge emerge, and will also influence the data that are gathered. There are other necessary steps. Develop appropriate analytical tools, including programs for data mining and machine learning. Make certain that data are usable, properly annotated and openly shared. Model the molecular and cellular components involved in a biological phenomenon, to allow analysis of dynamic behaviours and interactions. Sometimes just writing down the equations without seeking solutions can be helpful, simply because it imposes greater rigour on model building. More theory is needed. My exemplars for this include the evolutionary biologists Bill Hamilton and John Maynard Smith, and the geneticists Barbara McClintock and Francis Crick. Their papers are permeated with richly informed biological intuition, which makes them a delight to read. This sort of thinking will accelerate a shift from description to knowledge. Theorists can find fertile ground in considering the flow of information through living systems, which can help them to make better sense of the flood of biological data. Seeking to be led by theory and knowledge will probably require shifts in research culture. Theorizing should be encouraged, and theories should be included in experimental papers to put data in context. Attempts to do this should not be dismissed by editorial and funding processes as idle speculation. As Darwin said, it allows ideas to be attacked and either dismissed or modified. A sort of ‘tyranny of the field’ sometimes inhibits the generation of explanations different from the current consensus, but this is a mistake. If the new ideas are not satisfactory, then they will soon be eliminated and progress will be made. False facts should not be tolerated, but journals and research funders should be open to reasonable new ideas and interpretations, particularly if they differ from the current consensus. Evaluation committees should be tolerant when some of the ideas of people they are considering for promotion or funding are shown to be incorrect. Such approaches will advance not only research, but also teaching. Students will be better motivated and will feel more inspired if they are taught that biology has ideas — and that they are worth talking about.

20 Best MySQL Tools That You Can Use - Geeky Humans;"Vyom Srivastava | Oktober 31, 2020Oktober 31, 2020 | Dev Tools
 Are you aware of the term MySQL or MySQL tools? The word itself is basically a combination of two words My+ SQL where “My” is the name of the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius and “SQL” stands for the Structured Query Language. I hope you are familiar with the word SQL that is basically a standard language that stores, manipulates, and retrieves data of the database. SQL is having three parts named as Data Definition, Data manipulation, and Data Control. Ok, let’s first understand the database and its basics. A database is basically considered as an application that stores data collection. There are other ways to store the data are also available like File System or Hash tables. Rather we do use database more as data fetching is quite easy and fast in it. For example, the photo gallery present in your mobile phone is a type of database, the documents saved in your phone system in form of My files or either on a laptop comes under the category of the database. So we can say we can find databases around us. But in the recent scenario, we do use RDBMS that is a Relational database Management system that helps you in managing and storing a large amount of data. Now the question arises if it is RDBMS then how it is different from DBMS. The answer is quite simple database generally stores the data but the RDBMS is software that does the same task of storage by storing data into different tables and all these tables are related to each other through primary key or foreign key concept or one to one or many relationships. Here the table in the database is one that has rows and columns and looks like a spreadsheet. Now move back to our topic MySQL. MySQL is software that is completely open-source, free, fast enough, and easy to use relational database management systems used by many companies. It is owned by a Swedish company named MySQL AB. MySQL allows users to access databases using SQL. Many web applications or CMS (Content Management system) that are database oriented use MySQL. For example Joomla, Drupal, WordPress, and PhpBB. Also, MySQL is used by various websites named Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Contents Now let’s talk about some of the best MySQL tools. As I discussed MySQL already now you know well that if there is a database then there is also a need for tools so that we can design, create, and administrate the database. These tools are quite useful for web developers and help in enhancing the functionality of web apps. MySQL can be managed by either the command line or the GUI tool. In this discussion, I will talk about only GUI tools as they save the user time and easy to operate. We are also having many MySQL tools options that are why it isn’t easy for choosing the best one. So I am going to discuss a variety of options of MySQL tools so that anyone can choose the tool according to their requirement. Let me give you a clear understanding of each of these tools.                      I tried to provide you detailed features of various GUI tools. These MySQL tools can be used as an alternative that works quite well with MySQL. Besides, they are providing database development and management but still, some of them are paid ones. It is only up to you that what type of requirements you are having so that you can choose either paid or a free one. Let me try to help you to find better options for you as well. Say you are a beginner in the area of database and you cannot pay much amount in that case if your only need is the basic functionality of the database you can choose free MySQL tools as mentioned earlier. You can even improve your skills using such tools as HeidiSQL, SQL Workbench, and Sequel Pro. If your requirement is related to high-quality development or advanced functionality of the database then you should prefer some other tools like DB forge Studio, Navicat, Toad Edge, and many more providing different features. Hope you understood well this topic. Don’t forget to do a detailed survey of tools that you want to use. Do ask your queries by posting or you can also ask about your doubts related to any tool. Even if I am wrong at any point do correct me so that we can together spread valuable knowledge. You can also check out our article on MySQL vs MongoDB.

Nucleic Acids Research, Database Issue (2020) PDBe entry pages traditionally focus on single PDB entries, with limited information on entries that are related to the same macromolecule. The PDBe-KB team is proud to present a new type of entry page, that focuses on full length proteins instead of single PDB entries. Currently, you can use PDB or UniProt identifiers of proteins to display all the related PDB data, from the list of all the available PDB entries, to functional annotations of ligand binding sites, macromolecular interaction interfaces, and related publications.

                                                 Cofactors are essential for many enzyme reactions. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains several enzyme structures, many bound to cofactor or cofactor-like molecules. In collaboration with the Thornton team, we have implemented a semi-automated annotation process that identifies such molecules in the PDB. The information is updated weekly with each PDB release and is stored in the PDBe database. The up-to-date information is made available via the PDBe REST API and query system, and can be visualised on the PDBe entry pages.

                                             The goal of the Genome3D project is to provide predicted macromolecular structures for structurally uncharacterised protein sequences, thereby helping biologists exploit structural data to understand protein functions. As part of the project, one of the current objectives is to increase the volume of predicted structural data (i.e. map CATH and SCOP protein superfamilies, determine evolutionary conserved residues) and integrate it into the major central data repositories InterPro and PDBe.

                                             The PepVEP project aims to use existing services from UniProt, the EBI Variation team, the Thornton team and PDBe to implement an integrated platform for interpreting the functional effects of variants. The project concentrates mainly on developing user interface to depict variation data on protein sequence and structure. PDBe is adding additional API calls to its existing API to provide structural residue information for the platform and aims to extend the sequence feature viewer to provide these data on PDBe pages. Finding RNA molecules in the PDB has previously been difficult due to the lack of standard naming and classification, compared to proteins. Many RNA molecules are classified by Rfam, a database of non-coding RNA families based at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). We’ve worked together with our colleagues at Rfam to make use of their mappings of RNA molecules present in the PDB. As part of PDBe-KB, we are continuing to work on other features that will improve representation of RNA molecules at PDBe.";http://pdbekb.org;
Machine Learning Helps Reveal Cells’ Inner Structures in New Detail | HHMI;"HHMI is a science philanthropy whose mission is to advance basic biomedical research and science education for the benefit of humanity.  HHMI supports people, rather than projects, because it’s individual scientists who break barriers to advance knowledge. HHMI empowers exceptional scientists and students to pursue fundamental questions in basic science. HHMI believes every student and citizen can experience science in a meaningful way. HHMI shares the latest on our research, education, and organizational news. HHMI is advancing academic science by creating opportunities for everyone to learn, contribute, and thrive. Janelia’s COSEM Project Team has created a set of tools to make annotated 3D images of cells, showing the relationships between different organelles. Open any introductory biology textbook, and you’ll see a familiar diagram: A blobby-looking cell filled with brightly colored structures – the inner machinery that makes the cell tick. Cell biologists have known the basic functions of most of these structures, called organelles, for decades. The bean-shaped mitochondria make energy, for example, and lanky microtubules help cargo zip around the cell. But for all that scientists have learned about these miniature ecosystems, much remains unknown about how their parts all work together. Now, high-powered microscopy – plus a heavy dose of machine learning – is helping to change that. New computer algorithms can automatically identify some 30 different kinds of organelles and other structures in super high-resolution images of entire cells, a team of scientists at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus reports October 6, 2021, in the journal Nature. The detail in these images would be nearly impossible to parse by hand throughout the entire cell, says Aubrey Weigel, who led the Janelia Project Team, called COSEM (for Cell Organelle Segmentation in Electron Microscopy). The data for just one cell is made up of tens of thousands of images; tracing all a cell’s organelles through that collection of pictures would take one person more than 60 years. But the new algorithms make it possible to map an entire cell in hours, rather than years. “By using machine learning to process the data, we felt we could revisit the canonical view of a cell,” Weigel says. In addition to two companion articles in Nature, Janelia scientists also released a data portal, OpenOrganelle, where anyone can access the datasets and tools they’ve created. These resources are invaluable for scientists studying how organelles keep cells running, says Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, a senior group leader and interim head of Janelia’s new 4D Cellular Physiology research area who is already using the data in her own research. “What we haven’t really known is how different organelles and structures are arranged relative to each other – how they’re touching and contacting each other, how much space they occupy,” she says. For the first time, those hidden relationships are visible. The COSEM team’s journey started with data collected by high-powered electron microscopes housed in a special vibration-proof room at Janelia. For the past ten years, these microscopes have been churning out high-resolution snapshots of the fly brain. Janelia senior scientist Shan Xu and senior group leader Harald Hess have engineered these scopes to mill off super-thin slivers of the fly brain using a focused beam of ions – an approach called FIB-SEM imaging. The scopes capture images layer by layer, and then computer programs stitch those images together into a detailed 3D representation of the brain. Based on these data, Janelia researchers released the most detailed neural map of the fly brain yet. Credit: COSEM Project Team  In the midst of imaging the fly brain, Hess and Xu’s team also looked at other samples. Over time, they amassed a collection of data from many kinds of cells, including mammalian cells. “We thought that this detailed imaging of whole cells might be of larger interest to cell biologists,” Hess says (findings from Xu and Hess also published October 6, 2021, in Nature). Weigel, then a postdoc in Lippincott-Schwartz’s lab, began mining those data for her own research. “The resolving power of the FIB-SEM imaging was amazing, and we were able to see things at a level we couldn’t have imagined before,” says Weigel, “but there was more information in one sample than I could analyze in several lifetimes.” Realizing that others at Janelia were working on computational projects that might speed things up, she began organizing a collaboration.  “All of the pieces were here at Janelia,” she says, and forming the COSEM project team aligned them towards a common goal. Larissa Heinrich, a graduate student in group leader Stephan Saalfeld’s lab, had previously developed machine learning tools that could pinpoint synapses, the connections between neurons, in electron microscope data. For COSEM, she adapted those algorithms to instead map out, or segment, organelles in cells. Saalfeld and Heinrich’s segmentation algorithms worked by assigning each pixel in an image a number. The number reflected how far the pixel was from the nearest synapse. An algorithm then used those numbers to ID and label all the synapses in an image. The COSEM algorithms work in a similar way, but with more dimensions, Saalfeld says. They classify every pixel by its distance to each of 30 different kinds of organelles and structures. Then, the algorithms integrate all of those numbers to predict where organelles are positioned. Using data from scientists who have manually traced organelle boundaries and assigned numbers to pixels, the algorithm can learn that particular combinations of numbers are unreasonable, Saalfeld says. “So, for example, a pixel can’t be inside a mitochondrion at the same time it’s inside the endoplasmic reticulum.” To answer questions like how many mitochondria are in a cell, or what their surface area is, the algorithms need to go even further, says group leader Jan Funke. His team built algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge about organelles’ characteristics. For example, scientists know that microtubules are long and thin. Based on that information, the computer can make judgments about where a microtubule begins and ends. The team can observe how such prior knowledge affects the computer program’s results – whether it makes the algorithm more or less accurate – and then make adjustments where necessary.  After two years of work, the COSEM team has landed on a set of algorithms that generate good results for the data that have been collected so far. Those results are important groundwork for future research at Janelia, says Weigel.  A new effort headed by Xu is taking FIB-SEM imaging to even greater levels of detail. And another soon-to-launch project team named CellMap will further refine COSEM’s tools and resources to create a more expansive cell annotation database, with detailed images of many more types of cells and tissue. Together, those advances will support Janelia’s next 15-year research area, 4D Cellular Physiology – an effort led on interim basis by Lippincott-Schwartz to understand how cells interact with each other within each of the many different kinds of tissue that make up an organism, says Wyatt Korff, Director of Project Teams at Janelia. With new resources like those created by the COSEM team and the Enhanced FIB-SEM Technology group, Korff says, “we can actually begin to answer those questions, in a way that we haven’t had access to in the past.” ### Citation Larissa Heinrich, Davis Bennett, David Ackerman, Woohyun Park, John Bogovic, Nils Eckstein, Alyson Petruncio, Jody Clements, Song Pang, C.

The IUCr stable of journals are proponents of the FAIR and FACT principles of publishing: data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (Wilkinson et al., 2016) and Fair, Accurate, Confidential and Transparent (van der Aalst et al., 2017; Helliwell, 2019). This has been manifested by a number of leading contributions to the field of structural biology including publication standards for a variety of data types (Kroon-Batenburg & Helliwell, 2014; Adams et al., 2019; Guss & McMahon, 2014) as well as mandatory deposition of coordinates, and subsequently structure factors, for publication of macromolecular crystal structures. This approach has largely satisfied the FAIR and FACT principles. However, a further step is required to ensure that the data deposited in a third-party database fully support the conclusions drawn from those data. This step requires the mandatory submission of data (e.g. coordinates and reduced diffraction data, discussed further below) to accompany the manuscript describing the work. This action does not imply that the various databases [PDB (Burley et al., 2019), EMDB (Lawson et al., 2016), SASBDB (Kachala et al., 2016), BMRB (Ulrich et al., 2008) etc.] are not doing a good job of validating data submitted to them. Indeed, the validation reports produced by databases are an important pillar in the FAIR approach to structural biology. Nevertheless, it is not the role of the databases to test the extent to which the interpretations and conclusions of a manuscript incorporating structural biology research (possibly by multiple methods) are supported by the deposited data. This role belongs in the manuscript review cycle. Authors may ask why submission of data needs to be made mandatory. After all, the Notes for Authors for Acta Cryst. D, Acta Cryst. F and IUCrJ all indicate that editors may request such data from the author. However, the current system causes delays in the review system when editors have to request data. The added inconvenience increases the possibility of poorly supported interpretations avoiding scrutiny and being published. In order to clarify the situation, and maintain the IUCr's position leading the field in data quality standards in structural biology, submission of deposited data for review is best practice. Historically there has been reticence to provide data for review as this might provide a competitor with an advantage. This concern has reduced substantially over recent years as increasing numbers of macromolecular structures are released prior to publication, and complementary methods such as accurate and precise computational predictions are more widely used. Indeed, the increasing prevalence of preprint versions of papers has further expedited the release of non-peer-reviewed data. Data submitted to IUCr Journals will be mandated for review purposes only, and thus the ethical position of a reviewer receiving them is clearly defined. The concept of data deposition can be extremely broad, so it is important that we clarify what is mandated and what is recommended. The non-negotiable starting point is that for any manuscript containing conventional structures determined by the most common techniques (crystallography, NMR, cryoEM, SAXS) the data that are deposited with the relevant database to obtain the accession code and validation reports must be uploaded prior to editorial review. This set of standard files (which may include coordinate files, reduced diffraction data, restraint lists, electron-density maps, buffer-subtracted scattering curves, along with any validation reports) should already be immediately at hand to the submitting author. Additionally, depending on the manuscript in question there are cases where additional data should be provided. For example, many crystal structures may have indications of space-group ambiguity, twinning, anisotropy, alternate unit cells or other pathologies for which the review process would benefit from the submission of scaled but unmerged intensity data. We do not mandate submission for review of primary data as this is not practicable, however we continue to recommend that such data be made publicly available (Guss & McMahon, 2014). To accompany the requirement for data, which will apply from the start of 2022, the journals Acta Cryst. D, Acta Cryst. F and IUCrJ are unifying their requirements for information to be included in the standard tables for various experiment types (colloquially Table 1 for crystal structures). These new requirements will be described in detail in the revised Notes for Authors for the journals. Adams, P. D., Afonine, P. V., Baskaran, K., Berman, H.

Taxon names matter - GTDB Forum;"Taxonomy involves naming, delimiting and organizing groups of organisms (taxa) on the basis of shared traits that, ultimately, reflect their evolutionary history. Taxonomy itself evolves and revising old taxonomic schemes is necessary. The GTDB aim to produce a more uniform and stable genome-based taxonomy is laudable and extremely useful. However, despite some improvements, there is still an important problem in the current GTDB nomenclature: several standing taxon names are being reused for a new phylogenetic delimitation (a different extent of organisms). This introduces confusion and prevents meaningful comparison with long-accumulated knowledge, especially for groups with a long history in microbiology science. I previously raised the problem (to Phil) and suggested to give new names to newly circumscribed taxa. This was fortunately done for some archaeal taxa. Thus, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, which encompassed clades of very different breadth in various GTDB releases as compared with classical taxonomic schemes since Woese’s formal definition in 1990, disappeared as GTDB phyla and were replaced by several phyla with different new names (Thermoproteota, Halobacterota, Methanobacteriota, etc.). Unfortunately, the problem still affects some important classical taxa within Bacteria. I will mention two such cases. The first concerns the Proteobacteria, traditionally encompassing Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon- and Zetaproteobacteria. In the current GTDB release, Proteobacteria is reused to refer to only a subset of those clades excluding former Delta- and Epsilonproteobacteria clades (Desulfobacterota, Myxococcota, Bdellovibrionota, Campylobacterota, etc.). This is extremely confusing, since Proteobacteria is among the most diverse and studied taxa. A large body of knowledge about Proteobacteria integrate clades that are now excluded in the GTDB ‘Proteobacteria’. Could you consider changing the name of the GTDB ‘Proteobacteria’ phylum to a new name to prevent that confusion? A similar situation affects the GTDB taxon Cyanobacteria, which classically corresponds to the clade including only ancestrally oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (GTDB Cyanobacteriia) but that in the GTDB taxonomy includes also two taxa of related non-photosynthetic bacteria. Accumulated knowledge on cyanobacteria exclude those other taxa. In addition, this taxon also exists in the botanical code, such that it is likely that the same name, Cyanobacteria, persists in the future to refer to two different clades of organism, which complicates and obscures scientific progress. Again, would it be possible to simply give a different name to the clade formed by classical Cyanobacteria and its two related clades? In general, renaming taxa differently rather than changing the semantics (the extent of organisms) of a given name would be extremely important for clarity in the (micro)biology community. Would you consider this element for future releases? Thank you for the GTDB initiative, best wishes Puri Lopez-Garcia Hi Puri Thanks a lot for expressing your concerns.
I will do my best to reply asap. Kindest regards,
Masha Thanks Puri, it sounds like you might be making a case for using the name Pseudomonadota to encompass the group GTDB defines as Proteobacteria…
Bw, Phil Pseudomonadota or any other name that avoids confusion would be great. Thank you for considering it and help make things clear. We need it so much!
Cheers @purilopez  “Pseudomonadota or any other name…” no, please not any other name, and not the utterly confusing Pseudomonadota, for the sake of some continuity that can be easily communicated. as @sharmaG30 suggested on twitter (https://twitter.com/sharmaG30/status/1469938195332677634?s=20)  “Proteobacteriota” would do: the “-ota” suffix signals the new taxonomy and the “Proteo-” signals the continuity. Proteobacterota would also be confusing exactly because it seems in continuity with  the GTDB ‘Proteobacteria’ and classical Proteobacteria encompass many more groups than those named ‘Proteobacteria’ by GTDB.
The problem is using the same name (here Proteobacteria) to refer to different groups of organisms. Microbial taxonomy looks every day more like The Tower of Babel yes, puri, “we’re en ruta babilon” as manu chao sings 
and no, I don’t think that Proteobacteriota (with the “i”, mind you) would be confusing but, on the contrary, could be easily communicated to e.g. students as successor of the former Proteobacteria lacking two groups, delta+epsilon, that were sort of taxonomic junk drawers anyway. call it descent with modification, if you like. Well, I think it is actually chaos because there are several decades of research (I know people think that research done last year is already obsolete) on Proteobacteria that include Delta+Epsilon. Whether they deserved or not to be in that group is another thing. But if you want not to introduce confusion, giving another name to the descending group would be the best thing to do. Taxonomists can find the name that suits best. I am witnessing perplexity around just now.
Actually, that is the solution (thanks!!!) adopted by GTDB in the case of archaea: excluding Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota as GTDB terms and giving new names to their different descending phyla. You might like the new names or not, but the clade they refer to is clear. This is the first step, to understand each other when we use a term, to speak the same language. The rest is Babel. Dear Puri Thanks again, the issue that you brought is not something that GTDB should or could deal with. There are official nomenclature rules that dictate how taxa should be named and when those names should be changed.
Changes in circumscription whether or not they modify the nature of the taxon are not leading to change in the name of that taxon. This has always been the case, please see Section 7 of the ICNP. It is the nomenclature type that determine the application of name to the taxon.
Furthermore, when alteration of circumscription modifies the nature of the taxon, one could simply suggest an emendation but name stays the same. Otherwise, if one would change the name based on every single change in circumscriptions, there won’t be any nomenclature stability…This is one of the essential principles of the official prokaryotic nomenclature “Aim at stability of names”, and your concerns are not falling under its other principles such as “Avoid or reject the use of names which may cause error or confusion” since changing a name while retaining the same type would lead directly to confusion if there is no sufficient reason for this… Thank you for your answer. The stability of taxon names is a good thing if it helps clarifying and rationalizing the classification system. Unfortunately, not only the circumscription of some names is regularly changing but we now assist to the emergence of dual meaning for some taxon names. This is most unfortunate. Thank you for this discussion, and I could totally understand your concerns but it wasn’t different before GTDB. I meant in terms on nomenclature principles and rules. Taxonomy is changing with growing knowledge and this is normal, and some taxa might be affected more than others. The nomenclature system is designed in a way that allows to express those changes with minimal disturbance to the whole system and to track changes thanks to the nomenclature types. Perhaps we could have a similar kind of forum on the ICSP website. I believe that it would be a better place for such discussions…
Thank you,

The IUCr stable of journals are proponents of the FAIR and FACT principles of publishing: data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (Wilkinson et al., 2016) and Fair, Accurate, Confidential and Transparent (van der Aalst et al., 2017; Helliwell, 2019). This has been manifested by a number of leading contributions to the field of structural biology including publication standards for a variety of data types (Kroon-Batenburg & Helliwell, 2014; Adams et al., 2019; Guss & McMahon, 2014) as well as mandatory deposition of coordinates, and subsequently structure factors, for publication of macromolecular crystal structures. This approach has largely satisfied the FAIR and FACT principles. However, a further step is required to ensure that the data deposited in a third-party database fully support the conclusions drawn from those data. This step requires the mandatory submission of data (e.g. coordinates and reduced diffraction data, discussed further below) to accompany the manuscript describing the work. This action does not imply that the various databases [PDB (Burley et al., 2019), EMDB (Lawson et al., 2016), SASBDB (Kachala et al., 2016), BMRB (Ulrich et al., 2008) etc.] are not doing a good job of validating data submitted to them. Indeed, the validation reports produced by databases are an important pillar in the FAIR approach to structural biology. Nevertheless, it is not the role of the databases to test the extent to which the interpretations and conclusions of a manuscript incorporating structural biology research (possibly by multiple methods) are supported by the deposited data. This role belongs in the manuscript review cycle. Authors may ask why submission of data needs to be made mandatory. After all, the Notes for Authors for Acta Cryst. D, Acta Cryst. F and IUCrJ all indicate that editors may request such data from the author. However, the current system causes delays in the review system when editors have to request data. The added inconvenience increases the possibility of poorly supported interpretations avoiding scrutiny and being published. In order to clarify the situation, and maintain the IUCr's position leading the field in data quality standards in structural biology, submission of deposited data for review is best practice. Historically there has been reticence to provide data for review as this might provide a competitor with an advantage. This concern has reduced substantially over recent years as increasing numbers of macromolecular structures are released prior to publication, and complementary methods such as accurate and precise computational predictions are more widely used. Indeed, the increasing prevalence of preprint versions of papers has further expedited the release of non-peer-reviewed data. Data submitted to IUCr Journals will be mandated for review purposes only, and thus the ethical position of a reviewer receiving them is clearly defined. The concept of data deposition can be extremely broad, so it is important that we clarify what is mandated and what is recommended. The non-negotiable starting point is that for any manuscript containing conventional structures determined by the most common techniques (crystallography, NMR, cryoEM, SAXS) the data that are deposited with the relevant database to obtain the accession code and validation reports must be uploaded prior to editorial review. This set of standard files (which may include coordinate files, reduced diffraction data, restraint lists, electron-density maps, buffer-subtracted scattering curves, along with any validation reports) should already be immediately at hand to the submitting author. Additionally, depending on the manuscript in question there are cases where additional data should be provided. For example, many crystal structures may have indications of space-group ambiguity, twinning, anisotropy, alternate unit cells or other pathologies for which the review process would benefit from the submission of scaled but unmerged intensity data. We do not mandate submission for review of primary data as this is not practicable, however we continue to recommend that such data be made publicly available (Guss & McMahon, 2014). To accompany the requirement for data, which will apply from the start of 2022, the journals Acta Cryst. D, Acta Cryst. F and IUCrJ are unifying their requirements for information to be included in the standard tables for various experiment types (colloquially Table 1 for crystal structures). These new requirements will be described in detail in the revised Notes for Authors for the journals. Adams, P. D., Afonine, P. V., Baskaran, K., Berman, H.

AI cracks the code of protein complexes—providing a road map for new drug targets | Science | AAAS;The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in protein structure prediction continues. Only 1 year ago, software programs first succeeded in modeling the 3D shapes of individual proteins as accurately as decades-old experimental techniques can determine them. This summer, researchers used those AI programs to assemble a near-complete catalog of human protein structures. Now, researchers have upped the ante once again, unveiling a combination of programs that can determine which proteins are likely to interact with one another and what the resulting complexes— crucial engines of the cell—look like. “It’s a really cool result,” says Michael Snyder, a systems biologist at Stanford University. “Everything in biology works in complexes. So, knowing who works with who is critical.” Those relationships were hard to reach with previous techniques. The new ability to predict them, he says, should yield an array of insights into cell biology and possibly reveal new targets for the next generation of therapeutic drugs. Mapping proteins’ shapes down to the atomic scale has until recently required costly and slow experimental techniques, such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Those experimental techniques, if they work at all, typically only produce individual protein structures. Computer modeling experts have worked for decades to speed things up. Their recent success has depended on deep learning algorithms, which use databases of experimentally solved protein structures to train software programs how to predict structures for proteins based on their amino acid sequences. Last year, two groups, one from a U.K. company called DeepMind and the other led by David Baker at the University of Washington, Seattle, created rival AI programs that both now churn out predicted protein structures by the thousands. The software also produced structures for a handful of known protein complexes, mostly in bacteria. But in eukaryotes—organisms from yeast to people—the interacting partners are often unknown. Identifying them and predicting how they come together in a complex was too high a bar for the original programs. Now, both research groups have tweaked their programs so they can solve structures of protein complexes by the hundreds. Online today in Science, Baker and his colleagues use a combination of AI techniques to solve the structures of 712 complexes in eukaryotes. To find proteins that may form complexes together, the team began by comparing the amino acid sequence of all 6000 yeast proteins to those from 2026 other fungi and 4325 other eukaryotes. The comparisons allowed the researchers to track how those proteins changed over the course of evolution and identify sequences that appeared to change in tandem in different proteins. The researchers reasoned that those proteins might form complexes, and that they changed in step to maintain their interactions. Then the team used its AI program, called RoseTTAFold, along with DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which is publicly available, to attempt to solve the 3D structures of each set of candidates. Out of 8.3 million identified coevolving yeast protein pairs, the AI programs identified 1506 proteins that were likely to interact and successfully mapped the 3D structures of 712, or about half. “These interactions span all processes of eukaryotic cells,” says team member Qian Cong, a biomedical informatics expert at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Among the highlights, Cong and Baker say, are structures for protein complexes that allow cells to repair damage to their DNA, translate RNA into proteins in ribosomes, pull chromosomes apart during cell reproduction, and ferry molecules through the cell membrane. “It’s a great example of the promise” of 3D structures, says DeepMind’s John Jumper, one of AlphaFold’s lead developers. By revealing precisely how proteins interact with one another, the models should help biologists visualize how previously unknown complexes carry out a multitude of jobs within the cell. “These models give hypotheses for experimentalists to test,” Cong says. And because disrupting these interactions could offer new ways to intervene in a wide variety of diseases, she adds, “it also gives you a lot of potential new drug targets.” More are likely on the way. Last month, Jumper and his colleagues posted a preprint on the bioRxiv server describing a new version of their AI, dubbed AlphaFold-Multimer, which mapped structures of 4433 protein complexes. Analyses within the AI program that gauge the confidence level of each fold suggest the structures were accurate up to 69% of the time. The bottom line, Baker says: “It’s really an exciting time for structural biology.” Bob is a news reporter for Science in Portland, Oregon, covering chemistry, materials science, and energy stories.

 Overview The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) seeks applications for projects that aim to use and gain insights into health and disease from existing single-cell datasets to help accelerate progress toward challenges associated with the compilation and exploration of large atlas-scale data. Given the growth of single-cell biology and the rapid increase in available data, CZI is looking to support projects that will advance the fields of single-cell biology and data science. Grantees will be expected to interact with a network among participating groups that builds community and accelerates progress. Applications are encouraged from computational experts outside the field of single-cell biology but with expertise relevant to overcoming current bottlenecks. Projects may include dedicated efforts to refine existing computational tools, benchmark classes of tools, improve standards, integrate available data that enables greater biological insight, develop new features that support interoperability of data or tools, and other major challenges brought forward. This request for applications is the first of three cycles planned for the coming years, with successful projects receiving 18 months of funding support. Scope Applications for two types of grants are welcome and will be reviewed independently. The maximum budgets for proposed projects are $400,000 total costs for Expanded Projects and $200,000 total costs for Focused Projects. All projects awards will be for an 18-month duration. The goal of this opportunity is to create a network of projects that address broad computational challenges and needs within single-cell biology at a variety of scales. If applicants wish to highlight existing or prospective collaboration among projects, that is encouraged and allowable, but all applications will be reviewed for their individual merit and impact. Single-cell biology has undergone rapid growth over the last five years, with a recent increase in the volume of available and openly accessible data. This funding opportunity is specifically intended to motivate and incentivize the development, refinement, and implementation of tools and approaches that make it possible for greater insights to be gained from available single-cell data. With this in mind, any form of data generation is considered out of scope. Projects must propose and rely on existing data that is openly and freely available (count matrices at minimum) at the time of application via the inclusion of a link to specific datasets in the applications. Furthermore, we strongly encourage applications to utilize data generated outside of their labs to enable interoperability and advances that are extensible to a wider segment of interested researchers. Addressing computational challenges and bottlenecks in single-cell biology will drive the field forward and make it possible for a greater number of scientists to benefit from emerging datasets and tissue atlases. This opportunity puts forward a broad scope that fundamentally aims to enable greater insight to be gleaned from single-cell data. Successful proposals are likely to incorporate some, or multiple, of the following attributes: It is also an explicit goal of this effort to build a community among international participants that encourages collaboration and coordination, and we envision that the overlap between funding cycles will allow continuity and learning. CZI will support the coordination of this community and promote opportunities for training, documentation, and knowledge sharing across projects and cycles. CZI suggests that you consult your home institution to determine eligibility to apply for this grant and your institutional policy on indirect costs. For questions about eligibility for this award or the application process, please contact us in advance of the proposal deadline at sciencegrants@chanzuckerberg.com. Deadline extensions will not be granted. We invite applications for consideration for funding during three distinct cycles: All dates for the second and third cycles are subject to change.

CZI does not provide feedback on decisions for unfunded proposals. Application and funding in earlier rounds will not impact eligibility for subsequent rounds. If a project is not funded, it will be eligible for subsequent rounds if revised and submitted. Identical applications are eligible but discouraged. Should a project be funded in an initial round of the CZI Single-Cell Data Insights RFA, an extension or elaboration of the work will be eligible for subsequent rounds. In these cases, metrics and output from the earlier project will be included for reviewers to consider. Reporting & Progress: Annual reports will be required to ensure progress toward project deliverables. Measures of progress will include project deliverables and engagement with the community consistent with the selection criteria for proposals.

 18k Accesses 5 Citations 373 Altmetric Metrics details The cell is a multi-scale structure with modular organization across at least four orders of magnitude1. Two central approaches for mapping this structure—protein fluorescent imaging and protein biophysical association—each generate extensive datasets, but of distinct qualities and resolutions that are typically treated separately2,3. Here we integrate immunofluorescence images in the Human Protein Atlas4 with affinity purifications in BioPlex5 to create a unified hierarchical map of human cell architecture. Integration is achieved by configuring each approach as a general measure of protein distance, then calibrating the two measures using machine learning. The map, known as the multi-scale integrated cell (MuSIC 1.0), resolves 69 subcellular systems, of which approximately half are to our knowledge undocumented. Accordingly, we perform 134 additional affinity purifications and validate subunit associations for the majority of systems. The map reveals a pre-ribosomal RNA processing assembly and accessory factors, which we show govern rRNA maturation, and functional roles for SRRM1 and FAM120C in chromatin and RPS3A in splicing. By integration across scales, MuSIC increases the resolution of imaging while giving protein interactions a spatial dimension, paving the way to incorporate diverse types of data in proteome-wide cell maps.

Indigenous music company Nagamo Publishing launches »       Playback;"Bedtracks and APTN have launched the world’s first Indigenous-created production music library for media. Toronto-based Nagamo Publishing is a subsidiary of APTN-created holding company Dadan Sivunivut, which also includes Red Music Rising and First Peoples Radio. Of note, Nagamo’s goals include providing Indigenous composers with opportunities to showcase their talent as well as giving clients access to their music, which spans all genres and nations. “Dadan Sivunivut couldn’t be more excited to establish a partnership with an industry leader in the field to foster the creation and dissemination of this never-before-heard music library,” said a statement from former APTN CEO Jean La Rose, who currently serves as president and CEO of Dadan Sivunivut and CEO of Nagamo Publishing. “We are confident it will be the best place to find not only incredible Indigenous sounds but also high-quality production music that just happens to be made by an incredible group of Indigenous composers.” Alongside La Rose, Nagamo Publishing sees Bedtracks artistic director Oliver Johnson serve as managing director. Additionally, Toronto-based Cree composer and artist Nigel Irwin – who joined in April 2020 – is the organization’s co-creative director. Irwin told Playback Daily that in his role he is tasked with finding composers and connecting with musicians and communities; expanding Nagamo Publishing’s library; media relations; as well as guiding composers and offering mentorship. Further, current clients include CBC, the NFB, Corus Entertainment and APTN. “We kept finding that our clients wanted authentic Indigenous music for various projects and we realized there wasn’t a centralized place to find traditional and contemporary pre-cleared music of this kind. We wanted to change that,” said Johnson in a statement. Of note, Nagamo Publishing’s beginnings started in early 2017 with the first iteration of the library, which was called Storytellers. The project was led by Bedtracks with the sponsorship of imagineNATIVE. Nagamo Publishing was incorporated under Dadan Sivunivut in 2019.

Indiana Music Company Sweetwater Made More Than $1 Billion in 2020 - 93.1FM WIBC;News » Local News » Indiana Music Company Sweetwater Made More Than $1 Billion in 2020 FORT WAYNE, Ind. — Sweetwater, the world’s leading music technology and instrument retailer headquartered in Fort Wayne, says it made more than $1 billion in revenue in 2020. Founder and CEO Chuck Surack says the achievement happened because of people who were stuck in their homes finding something to do, plus the “independent musicians, churches, and podcast producers everywhere.” “What’s really important to me and flattering to me is how we were able to help so many people and particularly this year,” Surack told Inside Indiana Business. “I heard over and over how much therapy we were providing and how they always wanted to learn to play an instrument and now they have the time and we were able to fulfill 1.5 million customers’ dreams and aspirations and that, to me, is totally flattering.” The company also added more than 400 jobs last year and opened a new distribution center that is nearly 500,000 square feet.;https://bit.ly/3coiTts;
Exploration Weekly - YT Partner Program Channels Doubled in 2020 / Apple Services Quarterly Revenue Up 24% / Will LMAC Acquire a Music Company Next?;"“Hold fast to dreams,
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird,

Langston Hughes
    

    
In a letter to the YouTube community, CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that, over the last three years, YouTube has paid out more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. More creators are also gaining the ability to monetize, with the number of channels joining the YouTube Partner Program in 2020 having doubled over the previous year.    
    
    
The services division at Apple hit a record quarterly revenue high of nearly $15.8 billion, up 24% from the $12.7 billion it brought in during the same period a year earlier. The group specifically consists of services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, App Store, and other software products, and it is the second largest division behind iPhones. 
  


Newly formed acquisition company, Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (LMAC), raised $575 million in its IPO in the US last week. A press release by the company stated that LMAC “intends to search for a target in the media, digital media, music, entertainment, communications, telecommunications and technology industries”. Will the next target acquisition be a music company, and if so, who will it be?

The Number of Channels Monetizing Via YouTube’s Partner Program Doubled in 2020, CEO Says
  
    
CEO Susan Wojcicki shared in a letter to the YouTube community looking back on 2020 that YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed approximately $16 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2019 based on an Oxford Economics report. Moreover, over the last three years, Wojcicki noted, YouTube has paid out more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. And more creators are gaining the ability to monetize, with the number of channels joining the YouTube Partner Program last year having doubled over 2019. Looking ahead, Wojcicki stated that YouTube was readying even more tools for the creator community. The company is investing in new mobile creation functionalities, including bringing its TikTok-like Shorts product to more markets this year. And the company is also developing new commerce tools that will enable viewers to discover and buy products that they see in videos.
 
Apple Services Hits Record $15.8 Billion in Quarterly Revenue

    
Apple's services division hit an all-time revenue high during the final three months of the year. The group, which accounts for sales from Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, App Store and other software products, had fiscal first quarter revenue of nearly $15.8 billion, up 24% from the $12.7 billion it brought in during the same period a year earlier. The growth in services revenue, a priority for the company in recent years, helped to drive record revenue for Apple, which reported quarterly sales of $111.4 billion. The main driver for the quarter was Apple's new line of iPhones, which brought in $65.6 billion in revenue. Services is Apple's second largest division behind iPhones. The company has prioritized keeping its device owners in its ecosystem by offering them a suite of media apps and other utility software.

 
Liberty Media Offshoot Raises $575M to Buy Huge Company - Will It Be In Music?
 
    
Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (LMAC), the newly formed “blank check” acquisition company launched by Liberty Media, raised $575 million in its IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in the US last week. The company’s 57,500,000 shares started trading at $10 per unit on January 22, under the symbol LMACU. According to a new press release, LMAC “intends to search for a target in the media, digital media, music, entertainment, communications, telecommunications and technology industries”. In response to that statement of intent, two questions on the lips of many in the music business today, are: will LMAC’s target acquisition end up being a music company, and if so, who will it be? In LMAC’s prospectus and on its new website, the company explains that, “We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target”. Amongst other holdings, Liberty Media - via its Liberty SiriusXM group - owns a 33% stake in Live Nation Entertainment, and a 5% stake in iHeartMedia. In addition, it owns a 74% stake in SiriusXM, which in turn fully owns Pandora.

COVID-19 Knocks 76% Off Europe’s Music Revenue
  
    
    
A study published by European Authors Society GESAC showed overall revenue in Europe's creative sector dropped 31% in 2020 from a high of $783 billion (€643 billion) in 2019, pre-pandemic, to $540 billion (€444 billion) last year. Music revenue in Europe also slumped some 76%, and box office sales at European cinemas fell an estimated 75%. The only creative sector to see an uptick was the video games industry, which recorded a 9% bump in sales.

French Study Offers New Data on Impact of User-Centric Payouts
  
    
    
According to a new study commissioned by the National Music Centre (CNM) in France from Deloitte, using data from Spotify and Deezer, switching to a user-centric system would reduce the royalties paid out to rightsholders of the top 10 artists by 17.2% - they’d get 7.7% of the overall payouts rather than 9.3%. The result would be small percentage gains further down the pyramid: an average 1.3% increase for artists ranked 11-100; 2.2% for those ranked 101-1,000; 0.5% for those between 1,001 and 10,000; and 5.2% for those outside the top 10,000. The CNM warned, however, that “If the percentages of change seem not insignificant, the amounts in value remain in reality limited.” That 5.2% average increase for artists outside the top 10,000 would be “at most a few euros per year on average” for those musicians.
  
Now There’s a Licensing Platform for Small-Scale Livestreams in the UK
  
    
    
PRS for Music formally announced the release of its one-stop licensing portal this week. The 107-year-old UK collecting society created the platform due to the “huge rise” in livestream concerts that’s arrived amid the pandemic, and the tool is available specifically for livestream events that generate $683.70 (£500) or less. The livestream licenses, which cover public performances as well as associated sync and mechanical licenses, cost $30.80 (£22.50) apiece for digital events with revenues of up to $342.25 (£250). Additionally, the licenses come with a price tag of $61.60 (£45) each for online gigs that make between £251 and £500. PRS for Music also noted in the release that it’s working “to apply temporary discounted rates” (until traditional concerts resume) for licensing on livestream sets that earn above £500. Moreover, the London-headquartered entity is “proactively in discussion with other societies to deliver” a global blanket license for UK gigs that “might be accessed internationally.”

In a letter to the YouTube community, CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that, over the last three years, YouTube has paid out more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. More creators are also gaining the ability to monetize, with the number of channels joining the YouTube Partner Program in 2020 having doubled over the previous year.    
    
    
The services division at Apple hit a record quarterly revenue high of nearly $15.8 billion, up 24% from the $12.7 billion it brought in during the same period a year earlier.

The Number of Channels Monetizing Via YouTube’s Partner Program Doubled in 2020, CEO Says
  
    
CEO Susan Wojcicki shared in a letter to the YouTube community looking back on 2020 that YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed approximately $16 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2019 based on an Oxford Economics report. Moreover, over the last three years, Wojcicki noted, YouTube has paid out more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. And more creators are gaining the ability to monetize, with the number of channels joining the YouTube Partner Program last year having doubled over 2019. Looking ahead, Wojcicki stated that YouTube was readying even more tools for the creator community. The company is investing in new mobile creation functionalities, including bringing its TikTok-like Shorts product to more markets this year. And the company is also developing new commerce tools that will enable viewers to discover and buy products that they see in videos.
 
Apple Services Hits Record $15.8 Billion in Quarterly Revenue

    
Apple's services division hit an all-time revenue high during the final three months of the year. The group, which accounts for sales from Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, App Store and other software products, had fiscal first quarter revenue of nearly $15.8 billion, up 24% from the $12.7 billion it brought in during the same period a year earlier. The growth in services revenue, a priority for the company in recent years, helped to drive record revenue for Apple, which reported quarterly sales of $111.4 billion. The main driver for the quarter was Apple's new line of iPhones, which brought in $65.6 billion in revenue. Services is Apple's second largest division behind iPhones. The company has prioritized keeping its device owners in its ecosystem by offering them a suite of media apps and other utility software.

 
Liberty Media Offshoot Raises $575M to Buy Huge Company - Will It Be In Music?
 
    
Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (LMAC), the newly formed “blank check” acquisition company launched by Liberty Media, raised $575 million in its IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in the US last week. The company’s 57,500,000 shares started trading at $10 per unit on January 22, under the symbol LMACU. According to a new press release, LMAC “intends to search for a target in the media, digital media, music, entertainment, communications, telecommunications and technology industries”. In response to that statement of intent, two questions on the lips of many in the music business today, are: will LMAC’s target acquisition end up being a music company, and if so, who will it be? In LMAC’s prospectus and on its new website, the company explains that, “We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target”. Amongst other holdings, Liberty Media - via its Liberty SiriusXM group - owns a 33% stake in Live Nation Entertainment, and a 5% stake in iHeartMedia. In addition, it owns a 74% stake in SiriusXM, which in turn fully owns Pandora.

COVID-19 Knocks 76% Off Europe’s Music Revenue
  
    
    
A study published by European Authors Society GESAC showed overall revenue in Europe's creative sector dropped 31% in 2020 from a high of $783 billion (€643 billion) in 2019, pre-pandemic, to $540 billion (€444 billion) last year. Music revenue in Europe also slumped some 76%, and box office sales at European cinemas fell an estimated 75%. The only creative sector to see an uptick was the video games industry, which recorded a 9% bump in sales. GESAC is calling for ""massive public financing"" and stronger support for private investment in cultural and creative businesses, to return the industry to growth post-COVID. They are also demanding a ""solid legal framework"" to allow creatives to adequately protect and leverage their original content online.

Primary Wave purchases Sun Records for reported $30 million; Legendary Memphis music label Sun Records has sold to New York-based music company Primary Wave for a reported $30 million. “We are extremely pleased to pass the Sun Records baton to Primary Wave and are confident that they will continue to reach new heights for the crown jewel of the music business created by Sam Phillips, which my brother, Shelby, and I have kept alive and relevant for the past 50 years,” said John A. Singleton, President of Sun Entertainment Corporation, in a statement. According to The New York Times, Primary purchased every recording made by Sun, except for Elvis Presley’s releases, which are currently owned by Sony. The deal includes the rights to Jerry Lee Lewis's hits, the early recordings of Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison, USA Today reported. The New York Times reported that Primary's portfolio is already quite impressive with the ownership of songs by Stevie Nicks, Smokey Robinson, Burt Bacharach, Bob Marley, and half the estate of Whitney Houston.;https://www.wtvr.com/entertainment/primary-wave-purchases-famed-memphis-music-label-sun-records-for-reported-30-million;
Indiana Music Company Sweetwater Made More Than $1 Billion in 2020 - 93.1FM WIBC;News » Local News » Indiana Music Company Sweetwater Made More Than $1 Billion in 2020 FORT WAYNE, Ind. — Sweetwater, the world’s leading music technology and instrument retailer headquartered in Fort Wayne, says it made more than $1 billion in revenue in 2020. Founder and CEO Chuck Surack says the achievement happened because of people who were stuck in their homes finding something to do, plus the “independent musicians, churches, and podcast producers everywhere.” “What’s really important to me and flattering to me is how we were able to help so many people and particularly this year,” Surack told Inside Indiana Business. “I heard over and over how much therapy we were providing and how they always wanted to learn to play an instrument and now they have the time and we were able to fulfill 1.5 million customers’ dreams and aspirations and that, to me, is totally flattering.” The company also added more than 400 jobs last year and opened a new distribution center that is nearly 500,000 square feet.;https://www.wibc.com/news/local-indiana/indiana-music-company-sweetwater-made-more-than-1-billion-in-2020/;
Sun Records, storied Memphis label, bought by New York's Primary Wave;"Sun Records — the storied Memphis label that helped midwife the birth of rock 'n' roll — has been sold to New York-based music company, Primary Wave. The sale, first reported by The New York Times, includes nearly 6,000 master recordings as well as the Sun Records logo and branding. The Sun label, founded by visionary producer Sam Phillips in 1952, first sold in 1969 to Nashville music entrepreneur Shelby Singleton. After purchasing the company from Phillips, Singleton formed the Sun Entertainment Corporation, which controlled the Sun music and logo for the next 52 years (though the Phillips family would continue to maintain a small interest in the company). Singleton died in 2009, but this week his brother, John A. Singleton, confirmed that the Sun holdings had sold — for an undisclosed price, though estimated to be around $30 million — to Primary Wave, continuing the recent trend of high-profile music asset sales. In the past few months alone, Bob Dylan has sold his publishing catalog to Universal for an estimated $300 million to $400 million, while companies like the Hipgnosis Song Fund have gobbled up the rights to the work of Neil Young and Blondie, among others. Founded in 2006 by veteran music executive Larry Mestel, Primary Wave has made its reputation working with and purchasing stakes in the estates of artists including Kurt Cobain and Whitney Houston, and the publishing on songwriters ranging from Smokey Robinson to Stevie Nicks, Burt Bacharach to Bob Marley. With the Sun sale, Primary Wave will now control one of the most historically significant catalogs in American music. This includes the hits of Jerry Lee Lewis (“Great Balls of Fire”), the early recordings of Johnny Cash (“Folsom Prison Blues”) and Roy Orbison (“Ooby Dooby”), and music by an array of blues, roots and rockabilly artists like Little Milton, Carl Perkins and Billy Lee Riley. (Notably, Elvis Presley’s early recordings for Sun were previously sold by Sam Phillips to RCA in 1955 as part of the purchase of Presley’s contract, and remain controlled by Sony Music.) “Sun was literally one of the birthplaces of rock and roll. Its influence helped spread music not only across America, but culturally across the globe,"" said Mestel, Primary Wave CEO. ""These songs are some of the most important gems in music history and we intend to treat it with the same respect and care that Shelby and John Singleton have over the years.” Sam Phillips died in 2003, but the Phillips family — which still owns publishing rights to numerous Sun classics through their Hi-Lo Music and Knox Music companies — will benefit from the sale, and from Primary Wave's efforts to reinvigorate the Sun brand.  “I’m glad to see it happen,” said Jerry Phillips, Sam Phillips’ son. “The Singleton family did great work with Sun, but I think Primary Wave is going to take it to a new level. These guys have some pretty big plans to step things up and have a lot of tools at their disposal to do that. From my perspective, that’s good for the legacy of Sam Phillips and the legacy of Sun.” Primary Wave’s purchase also includes ownership of the Sun Diner, a music-themed café which opened in Nashville in 2016. However, Sun Studios — the Memphis-based attraction located at the site of Sam Phillips’ former studio, the Memphis Recording Service — was not affiliated with the Sun Entertainment Corporation and remains unaffected by the sale. Although specific plans have not been announced yet, it’s expected that Primary Wave will be aggressive in expanding the Sun Records profile, in terms of its digital presence, sync and licensing opportunities, and as an intellectual property asset. “We are going to begin by organizing, catag and making available digitally all the music in the Sun catalog,” Mestel said. “We believe there is an enormous opportunity to reintroduce these classic records to a new youth culture and to market the importance of Sun historically as well as the iconic logo. You’ll see interesting marketing support for the music, which is Primary Wave’s trademark.” For Jerry Phillips, the Sun deal means that the vision of his father will continue to live on for generations to come. “It’s amazing that after 60 years, people still have that kind of interest, and put that kind of value on Sun,"" said Phillips. ""It’s an iconic record label, man. There’s no doubt about it.”";https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/01/28/sun-records-memphis-label-bought-new-york-primary-wave/4292383001/?fbclid=IwAR3W2V47DpkJ2Vic1YSW0YAWPVPYd_IEi62FceUOuLeQG2vXw9K9MdDXkMY;
APM Music - Wikipedia;"Associated Production Music, LLC (commonly known as APM Music) is an American production music company headquartered in Hollywood, California, initially as a joint venture between Zomba/Jive Production Music and EMI Production Music. APM Music's catalog contains more than 1,000,000 tracks[1][2] and its libraries include KPM Music, Bruton, Sonoton, Cezame, Hard and Kosinus, among others.[3] Music tracks from APM Music are used in TV shows, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Ren & Stimpy, The Mighty B!, GLOW, This is Us, and Westworld; films, including Lady Bird, Mudbound, and The Disaster Artist;[4] and video games, including Skylanders: Imaginators, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands.[citation needed] They were also used in various Motorola phones as ringtones. NFL Films has a joint venture between the NFL and APM Music where music is composed for NFL-related media.[citation needed] The APM catalog includes recordings dating back to 1900, music representing 192 countries, and well-known tracks like ""Heavy Action"" (the theme for Monday Night Football), ""The Big One"" (the theme for The People's Court), and ""Sweet Victory"" (from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode ""Band Geeks"").

Axiom Space unveils AX-1 crew for fully-private SpaceX mission to ISS;"In this article A pair of investors are joining the first fully-private flight to the International Space Station — not as financial backers, but as the passengers flying along. Houston-based start-up Axiom Space on Tuesday unveiled that real estate investor Larry Connor and Canadian investor Mark Pathy will fly on its upcoming AX-1 mission. The pair join former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría, who will be the commander of the flight, and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe. Connor will be the mission's pilot, which will make him the first private pilot on an orbital spaceflight. Axiom last year signed a deal with SpaceX for the mission. Elon Musk's company is scheduled to launch the all-private crew no earlier than January 2022, using a Crew Dragon capsule to carry them to the space station. The mission comes at a steep price — $55 million per person — but will net them an eight-day stay on the space station. ""Never has an entire crew been non-professional astronauts,"" López-Alegría told CNBC. ""This is really groundbreaking, and I think it's very important that the mission be successful and safe because we're really paving the way for lots of things to happen after us."" López-Alegría flew to space four times for NASA as a professional astronaut but now works for Axiom. He will lead them through about 15 weeks of training starting in the fall, command the spacecraft and make sure the other three crew members ""have a safe and productive time,"" he said. AX-1 was originally scheduled for October 2021, but slid to early 2022. Axiom wants to fly ""a couple of these missions per year,"" López-Alegría added, so future missions are on deck. Speculation abounded that AX-1 would feature actor Tom Cruise, as last year NASA announced that it is working with Cruise to film a movie on the ISS. Connor has lead The Connor Group since 2003, building the Ohio-based real estate investment firm to more than $3 billion in assets. Pathy, who is set to become the 11th Canadian astronaut, is the CEO and chairman of family office fund MAVRIK Corp, as well as chairman of the board at publicly-traded Montreal-based music company Stingray Group. Stibbe would be the second Israeli astronaut — the first was Ilan Ramon, a payload specialist on board Space Shuttle Columbia, who was killed in February 2003 when Columbia broke apart during re-entry. Stibbe was a close friend of Ramon's. While space tourism is an emerging sub-sector of the space industry, Axiom's private passengers do not put themselves in that category. ""We absolutely do not believe that we're space tourists,"" Connor told CNBC. López-Alegría similarly emphasized that the 10-day mission ""is 100% not a vacation for these guys."" ""They're really focused on having this be a mission to promote a benefit to society, so they each are working on flight programs,"" Lopez-Alegria said. ""They're teaming up with various institutions, hospitals and other research entities, as well as to do outreach while they're up there."" Each of three have research missions they will be conducting on behalf of other organizations. Connor is collaborating with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. Meanwhile, Pathy is working with the Canadian Space Agency and the Montreal Children's Hospital. Finally, Stibbe is working on behalf of the Ramon Foundation and Israeli Space Agency. ""I've volunteered myself to be a test subject,"" Connor said. ""We're not going there to be spectators; we're going there to do research and hopefully add some value for people."" Connor and Pathy together witnessed SpaceX's first astronaut launch, the Demo-2 mission in May, which was the first rocket launch either had seen in person. SpaceX developed Crew Dragon through heavy NASA funding, with the spacecraft built to fly astronauts to-and-from the ISS in low Earth orbit. SpaceX has launched two astronaut crews for NASA so far, including the first operational mission called Crew-1 in November. Although NASA contributed to its development, Musk's company owns and operates the spacecraft and rocket — with Axiom managing the mission and preparing the astronauts to launch. The AX-1 crew has yet to begin its formal training, but Connor said they have stopped by SpaceX's headquarters in Los Angeles for a spacesuit fitting and to see the spacecraft. ""The Crew Dragon capsule, in terms of quality and professionalism, is just outstanding,"" Connor said. ""And you can tell that, [as a group SpaceX is] exceptionally talented and committed to the mission."" Connor emphasized that ""NASA and SpaceX have nothing short of a remarkable safety record,"" which he said he reviewed with his family when considering the risk of flying to space. ""We got to the point where we're not only confident but comfortable that we can do both a valuable mission and a safe one,"" Connor said. AX-1 is expected to use SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft ""Resilience"" after it returns from its current Crew-1 mission. While the company regularly lands and reuses its Falcon 9 rocket boosters and its Cargo Dragon capsules, AX-1 would likely be the first time reuse is introduced to a Crew Dragon spacecraft. ""I'm very comfortable with that,"" López-Alegría said. ""Reusability is something that has been always made sense in human spaceflight."" At $55 million a seat, it's unsurprising that the first private space crew includes high net worth individuals like Connor and Pathy. The former said that it's ""a fair question and concern"" that some might criticize private spaceflight as only for the ultra rich. ""We have lots of domestic problems and challenges, as well as international, but does that mean we should forget about the future?"" Connor asked. ""And, if you really think about the future, my view is that space is the next great frontier, so shouldn't we be trying to explore and in some regards try to pioneer that?"" López-Alegría characterized the mission as ""the first crack in the door toward democratization of space,"" following closely on the heels of NASA's decision in 2019 to allow private missions to visit the ISS. NASA will charge each person $35,000 per day while on board, as compensation for the services needed such as food and data usage. ""It's not a very democratic demographic right now because of the cost of the flights, but we fully anticipate that the costs will start coming down,"" López-Alegría said. ""At some point we'll be able to offer these to the man-on-the-street. It's going to be a while but that's the goal, and you have to start somewhere."" For Connor's part, he asked that critics of private spaceflight ""think long term"" to 25 or more years from now. ""Will it be that uncommon for people to go into space? I think and I hope the answer is going to be no. So somebody has to start it, somebody has to do the exploration and set the standards and so hopefully people will will look at it in that way,"" Connor said.

Saregama’s quarterly revenues were up by 7% year-on-year to 134.6 crore rupees (around $18.5m) even though its music licensing revenues were down by 1% to 114.2 crore rupees ($15.7m). The company said that with no new films getting released in India for a period, it focused on non-film Hindi and regional language songs over the last 10 months, while buying up music rights for major movies due to come out in the next 6-14 months. The company also sold 138k more units of its Carvaan digital music player last quarter, which is down from 198k a year before, but represents a bounce back from much lower sales during the pandemic, which hampered sales of the preloaded-music device.

Warner Music Signs Distribution Deal with Punjabi Music Company Sky Digital India - BritAsia TV;"Warner Music India has signed an exclusive distribution deal with Sky Digital India — one of the country’s fastest-growing aggregators for Punjabi music. Distribution of Sky Digital’s content outside of India will be managed by ADA — Warner’s independent artist and label services division, while Warner Music India will be responsible for distribution within the country, reports Music Business Worldwide. Sky Digital India is home to Punjabi music stars including Jaani, B Praak, Mankirt Aulakh, Gippy Grewal, Sunanda Sharma, Sidhu Moosewala and Happy Raikoti and others. Sky Digital also manages premium Punjabi content-based YouTube channels with more than 15 million subscribers, making it the third largest Punjabi YouTube channel collective, with top videos on the site accumulating over 500 million views. The company currently aggregates releases from more than 42 Punjabi labels, two leading mainstream independent Hindi labels, and some top regional labels specialising in Haryanvi and Bhojpuri music – two of the fastest-growing regional languages in India after Punjabi. The deal will see Warner Music India help to grow Sky Digital’s market share in India, currently estimated at around 1% nationally, by establishing a presence for its artists and distributed label content on additional digital music services, adds Music Business Worldwide. Eliah Seton, President of Independent Music and Creator Services at Warner Music, said that he was looking forward to the international prospects for the Punjabi music scene. Seton was quoted saying: “There’s increasing interest in Punjabi music globally, ignited by diaspora communities in countries such as the US and Canada who’ve helped introduce it to a wider audience.” Adding “ADA is proud to represent Sky Digital India’s amazing catalogue to a worldwide audience.” Jay Mehta, Managing Director, Warner Music India (pictured), said: “The Punjabi music scene is absolutely exploding at the moment and Sky Digital’s artists already have a huge fanbase in India. “We’re in a great position to help connect them with even more music fans both here and around the world. This deal is a key milestone in the development of Warner Music’s presence in India.” Gurkaran Dhaliwal, Managing Director, Sky Digital India, said: “It is highly exhilarating for Sky Digital to be in partnership with Warner Music. “We’re excited about the possibilities for our entire region of North India to engage in the worldwide music industry. Through this deal with Warner Music, and the indomitable strength and scale that this region carries, we can expand together and achieve great success.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Cocoon Malibu;The music industry has been forced to adapt and pivot towards a model which relys heavily on viral hits, passive listening playlists, and a data-based focus. This has left a void in the industry, leaving behind artist developement as it takes time, energy, and money the labels ( and now artists ) dont have. The Cocoon is community gathering place, and a think-tank / incubator for ideas and the creative aspirations of the next wave of musicians, producers, directors, and visual artists and the brands that support them.

BMG Eliminates Controlled-Composition Clause From U.S. Label Contracts - Variety BMG Eliminates Controlled-Composition Clause From U.S. Label Contracts – Variety;"Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber

 Senior Music Editor BMG has announced that it is eliminating a standard U.S. record-label deduction that serves to reduce the income of songwriters, composers and lyricists: The various discounts and caps contained in the “controlled composition” clause, which it estimates cost songwriters $14 million last year. BMG will voluntarily refrain from applying the reductions to any new record deals and remove them from its entire catalogue over the next year, the company stated today. “The move forms part of BMG’s ongoing program to rebalance the music industry in favor of artists and songwriters by abandoning longstanding practices designed to reduce the incomes of musicians,” the statement reads. Earlier this year, the company, which was founded in 2008, pledged to review the record contracts from catalogs it has acquired for signs of racial bias.  











 BMG CEO Hartwig Masuch said, “It is unacceptable for the record industry to continue to apply deal terms which are solely designed to reduce the incomes of musicians. We have heard a lot during the coronavirus crisis of initiatives by music companies to support artists. The best way to support artists is not to subject them to unfair terms in the first place.” In principle the controlled composition clause is simply a way for labels to secure the licenses they need to release records, the announcement continues. “In practice, it has become a mechanism by which labels force artists who are also songwriters to accept a reduced royalty on physical product, typically with a 25% discount.” The practice, which dates back to the 1970s, often establishes a cap on the total royalties payable on a given album. If artists record songs by third party songwriters they can in extreme cases end up not only earning no money for their own songs, but even owing their labels money, the announcement notes. David Israelite, President and CEO of the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), applauded the move. “BMG deserves enormous credit for eliminating this poisonous practice. Controlled composition clauses in recording contracts have been one of the most harmful things to ever happen to songwriters. While their impact has been minimized thanks to NMPA’s efforts to make them illegal for digital products, there is still enough of a physical product market for controlled composition clauses to continue to plague the songwriting community. This is a wonderful pro-songwriter move by BMG.” Bart Herbison, Executive Director of Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI), said, “BMG ending the Controlled Composition clause in the company’s recording contracts is important, laudable and something that other record labels should embrace. The songwriter community has long waged battles over this practice that some have compared to ‘theft’. We salute BMG and challenge every record label to follow their lead and fully eliminate controlled composition immediately.”  








 Dina LaPolt, music lawyer, activist, and co-founder of Songwriters of North America (SONA) said, “BMG is taking a massive step forward for songwriters by removing the Controlled Composition clause from all of their recording agreements. This clause is an antiquated and restrictive provision in virtually all recording artist deals that seek to further reduce the songwriter’s mechanical royalties which, already regulated by the government, are much lower than any other income stream in recorded music. I sincerely hope the other record companies follow their lead.” Said Masuch, “The controlled composition deduction is just one of a whole series of ways in which record labels have historically maximized their own profits at the expense of musicians. Eliminating this unfair practice is just the latest in a series of measures BMG is taking to make the music industry fairer to artists and songwriters.” BMG has now set up a taskforce headed by COO Ben Katovsky specifically tasked with improving fairness in music contracts. Said Katovsky, “If you know your music industry history, it’s hard to dispute the fact that music companies have had a problem with treating artists fairly. As the youngest of the big international companies, we were able to start from scratch and design out many of the worst aspects of the old business from our new deals. But inevitably we sometimes find examples of historic bad practice lurking in some of the catalogues we have acquired.” “We have to be realistic – we cannot right all the wrongs of the past – but we’re going to try our damnedest. We are delighted to finally get rid of the controlled composition deduction. It is an anachronism which has no place in the new music business.” The Business of Entertainment";https://buff.ly/2Ns3MET;

Imploding Head Interviews: CEO of Major Music Company on the State of Live Music, Independent Venues, and more – The Imploding Head;"The Imploding Head 
				Est. 2020 ° Philadelphia 			 Welcome to Imploding Head Interviews, where we sit down with folks who create, promote, and generally help to foster art and music in their area. This week we sat down with an important mind in the live music industry to get their take on the current state of things.  It has become common knowledge that this country had a fairly rough time in 2020. Only a few days into 2021, signals point towards more hopelessness, too. Chaos and darkness have enveloped the country in the forms of a deadly pandemic and blood-boiling political tensions. Among the top cultural cravings across the board is the classic cure-all of live music.  Like many of its sister industries, the live music industry has had to adapt and evolve due to COVID-19 and unanswered questions about vaccinations and public events. From small, independent clubs that foster vibrant local scenes in towns across America to the larger, corporate-owned rooms run by seemingly imaginary figureheads, the feeling of helplessness is everywhere.  Where can we look to see the future of this business? When will we get our music back? In an attempt to find some answers, we were able to sit down with a high-level corporate contact who wishes to remain anonymous. Let’s just say they’re the head  of a certain company, and that company rhymes with JIVE STATION, so we went with that.  We talked (via Skype) with Jive Station from their home in California about the state of live music, how their branded venues are handling things, how they are getting through the pandemic, the best take-out tacos in Pasadena, and more.  Imploding Head: How have the venues within your brand handled the past year of cancelled shows and postponed festivals? Jive Station: Well, just like our independent counterparts, our talent buyers are doing their best to stay on top of all things COVID. Pushing shows to new dates is a daily task, and we “pay them accordingly.”  IH: I see you used air quotes there. Was that a joke? JS: You can see me? [Grunts] Oh, sh*t, my assistant told me that video was turned off. But yes, we pay them a very livable salary. According to what market they are working in. [Chuckles] and I was joking about the air quotes. The key to keeping things rolling on a nationwide basis is knowing that once things open back up, we’ll be able to provide the most quality shows for music fans to return to.  IH: As somebody who is close to the top of the music industry, when do you see a return to normalcy?  JS: It’s hard to say! [Laughs] There are a lot of balls in the air, so to speak. We have to keep our eye on the vaccination rollout across the States and we need to keep an eye on our local markets. We aim to open up as soon as possible, while making sure that local competition has as little money as possible [Laughs], so we can eventually own everything in sight. That will appease our masters. [Rubs Hands Together] IH: Right. So Summer 2021? 2022? Do you expect concerts to happen?  JS: At this time, I can’t speak too specifically, but we’re hoping by this summer. We have meetings daily about our plan to reopen our venues. As far as a personal projection – Let’s just say that it’s going to be a HOT summer this year. [Lights Cigar] Hotter than the 9 rings of fire that keep our Board Members tethered to the core of the Earth. IH: [Laughs] You said it. You’re known around town as kind of a “bad boy” in the industry.. Can you speak on how that reputation came about? JS: Aside from upcharging millions of people per year in outrageous ticket fees? Effectively putting a premium on fun and stealing their hard earned money for one night out? [Puffs Cigar]Probably my public cocaine use. Or that stupid rumor that TMZ spread? You’ve probably seen it… it’s about me being a fallen angel cursed with the eternal task of collecting souls for a certain high ranking demon. I just want to put that to rest right now. I’m not in cahoots with Satan. Ok? Leave it alone.  IH: The new trend seems to be outdoor, socially distant concerts in this day and age. Do you have any favorites from 2020? Any plans for outdoor shows in 2021? JS: Oh yes! It’s really been great to help out some of our favorite bands by organizing drive-in shows. We had Ween and The Disco Biscuits in Philadelphia. After not seeing any new shows for months, those were a lot of fun. I flew out for those and parked my private jet front and center. That was great.  Aside from that, I actually have Bon Jovi chained up in my backyard. He’s my favorite artist and it’s been a real treat to have him play for my family and me. [Screams] JOVI! PLAY ME MY SET. IH: Bon Jovi! He’s an East Coast legend. So you’ve been bi-coastal even through a pandemic? That’s really great. I know you’re in California right now, and I know you’re a huge foodie. Where are the best fish tacos in Pasadena? JS: Contrary to popular belief, I’m actually vegan. So my answer here is a little biased [chuckles] but I just don’t think you can go wrong around here. There are so many great vegan options in my neck of the woods. These days I’ve been keeping it simple. I’ll get JUST the beans from Taco Bell, I’ll take them home and put them on a bed of shredded romaine, and I make my own cheese from cashews and have a little burrito bowl! It’s really great stuff.

UMG increases recorded-music market share lead, indies enhance publishing dominance – Music & Copyright's Blog;"Music & Copyright's Blog The international business news service of global music copyright Music & Copyright’s annual survey of the recorded-music and music publishing sectors has revealed the changes in global market share for the three major music groups and the independent sector. In a repeat of the last review, UMG enhanced its position as the global leader. The company registered gains in both digital and physical market shares, while the publishing unit UMPG saw its share rise. Second-placed SME had a flat year for digital but lost share overall because of a dip in the company’s physical format share. For publishing, Sony’s share was down for the second consecutive year. Smaller major WMG saw its digital share rise but the overall recorded-music performance was unchanged year-on-year because of a dip in the company’s physical share. The independent sector had a mixed year with a fall in its digital recorded share more than offsetting a slight rise in the physical share. The sector enhanced its publishing dominance with a second straight year of share growth. UMG makes share gains at the indies expense
According to Music & Copyright, UMG increased its share of combined physical and digital recorded-music trade revenue last year, to 31.8% from 29.8% in 2018 (see Figure 1). For digital revenue only, UMG’s share was up to 33.8% from 32.4%, while its physical share grew to 25.8% from 23.4%. Figure 1: Record companies, physical- and digital-revenue market shares, 2018 and 2019
Source: Music & Copyright  SME was the second-largest record company, although its combined physical/digital market share slipped slightly last year to 19.8% from 19.9% in 2018. For the third consecutive year, SME registered a year-on-year fall in its physical format performance with a dip in share to 18.3% from 19.2%. However, following two years of decline, SME’s digital market share was unchanged last year, at 20.2%. The company’s share of all recorded-music trade revenue, which includes licensing and other revenue as well as income from physical and digital music sales, edged down, to 20.3% from 20.5% (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Record companies, total recorded-music-revenue market shares, 2018 and 2019
Source: Music & Copyright  The smaller of the three majors, WMG, experienced a reversal of its 2018 results, when the company’s digital share was down and its physical share up. Last year. WMG’s digital share increased slightly to 17.9% from 17.7%, while its physical share slipped to 11.7% from 13.4%. Overall, WMG’s combined physical/digital share edged down to 16.4% from 16.5%, while its total revenue share was unchanged at 16%.
Despite the changes in the majors’ shares, independent record companies’ combined physical/digital revenue share remained ahead of UMG’s, but only just. The independent company sector’s physical share stayed high at 44.2%, but a fall in the sector’s digital share resulted in the physical/digital share decreasing to 32% from 33.8%.  Slowdown in music publishing
In line the way in which Music & Copyright determines global recorded-music market shares, music publishing market shares are also based on revenue received by each company. Music & Copyright has calculated that global music publishing revenue grew 2.2% last year to $5.59bn from $5.47bn in 2018. The growth rate was notably lower than the 11.4% rise in 2018 and 11.2% increase in 2017. Sony maintained its leading position ahead of UMPG but suffered a fall in share for the second consecutive year. Sony’s share, which is made up of revenue from Sony/ATV, EMI Music Publishing (EMI MP), and Sony Music Publishing Japan, was down a single percentage point, to 26% from 27% (see Figure 3). Sony took the top spot in 2013 following the purchase of EMI MP by a Sony-led consortium in 2012. Sony then acquired the approximate 60% of the interest in EMI MP held by the consortium in November 2018, resulting in EMI MP becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony. Figure 3: Music-publishing companies, revenue market shares, 2018 and 2019
Source: Music & Copyright  UMPG was the second-largest music publisher last year. Music & Copyright estimates the company’s share grew for the second year in a row, to 21% from 20.2% in 2018. Furthermore, UMPG was the only major publisher to increase its share. Third placed Warner Chappell Music’s share was down last year, to 11.6% from 12.3%. The collective share of independent music publishers was up, to 42.3% from 41.4%. If you would like more information about the newsletter or set up a subscription, then send us an email

Imran Ahmed Launches A New Kind Of Music Company - Hypebot;"A Spotify profile of music industry entrepreneur Imran Ahmed, who successfully worked at the NME, BBC, and XL Recording before relocating to Los Angeles to create and launch a new kind of music company. Guest post from Spotify for Artists In London, he discovered, signed, and built artists at the NME, the BBC and with XL Recordings. He’s since moved to Los Angeles and launched a new kind of music company, In Real Life. There’s a lot to be gleaned from following Imran Ahmed’s career path through some of the British music industry’s most storied brands. The founder and sole owner of In Real Life, a Los Angeles-based artist services company he founded with backing from AWAL, Ahmed has worn many hats in his two decades in the business. He’s been a writer and editor at UK music weekly, the New Musical Express (NME); a music programmer and presenter on BBC radio; a promoter of London club night, FROG; and the voice behind influential music blog, Abeano — all this before spending a dozen years doing A&R at XL Recordings, where he signed Vampire Weekend, Jai Paul, and Jungle. A son of Pakistani immigrants who grew up in the predominantly white East England county of Essex, his career trajectory was aided by neither silver spoons nor Oxbridge connections, Ahmed is that all-too rare figure in the music business: a Brown, self-made citizen of the culture world with the pop acumen to upend establishment norms, and succeed on his own terms. Now, that success—born of “an experience in otherness,” powered by entrepreneurial spirit, industrious hustle, and creativity centered on a life-long love of music discovery—is focused to serve a new kind of music company. In Real Life is part label (Liv.e’s masterful Couldn’t Wait To Tell You… is one of its releases), part management shop (working with Philadelphia electronic soul producer/singer, Body Meat), and part music publisher (administering the tracks of ascendant house music superstar, Peggy Gou). Yet to hear Ahmed describe it, In Real Life’s multi-dimensional business practices are only a gateway to its “convictions,” and a rethink of what the music business looks and acts like. Which is why chatting with him is as much a recital of past glories, as a philosophical discussion about the future. One of a generation of kids practicing Michael Jackson’s dance moves in his bedroom and taping songs off the radio (“two fingers over the record button, waiting for Salt N’ Pepa”), Ahmed’s love of music came early. His father bought a cassette player that came with a free cassette single, Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al” that would presage his A&R career: “That [tape] was quite formative, because I ended up signing Vampire Weekend, 20 years later.” As a teenager, he started selling mixtapes to kids on the playground, made from the latest CD singles (“I sold the tapes for a couple of pounds each — I figured out that I could make a living from music”). By the time Oasis showed up in the mid-90s, he was all in on music: “Britpop provided a scene to tap into, a world that I could exist in, and that, pivoted pretty fast to wanting to be a music journalist and be a part of it all.” He went to the University of Liverpool, and in the early Aughts found himself in London, a freelance music writer at The Guardian and The Face and eventually, at his dream job, as an editor at the NME. As with many children of immigrants, the entrepreneurial spirit instilled in Ahmed by his parents — a father who went from driving taxis to installing satellite dishes, and a mother who cleaned homes, both encouraging him to “do something you love for a living because we never had the chance to”— kept his ambitions lit. The projects began overlapping naturally. “Something that I learned in the music game as I was in it longer, was that having an outlet for creativity is really important, it helps keep you pretty level-headed,” Ahmed says. “So, I wrote a lot for NME, but I also wanted to be the editor one day and have shows on BBC Radio One.” [In 2004 he participated as a pundit on a music poll for the famed British broadcaster, and continued as a presenter there.] “I think I have never been afraid to try lots of things.” One such thing was turning NME’s monthly industry-only music showcase, into the weekly party FROG, one of the quintessential London indie-dance nights of the Aughts, a party that helped showcase not just bands like Vampire Weekend and Bloc Party but a pre-EDM Calvin Harris as well. In 2005, Ahmed also started Abeano, a blog that allowed him to continue spotlighting new music, and that caught the eye of Richard Russell, XL’s chairman. “‘I want you to come and work for me, you can do whatever you want,’ which was very liberating,” says Ahmed, recalling Russell’s generous invitation. “That appealed to my entrepreneurial spirit. And I continued to do some radio stuff, and some writing while at XL. But a little into it, I made the decision that I wanted to throw my lot in entirely with the label.” Of the many lessons Ahmed learned at the storied label, one particular insight continues to push him along: his pursuit of new sounds and artists. When asked about his strategy for finding new talent, he unfurls a familiar list of Internet radio stations (he has a regular show on NTS), playlists, and the friends he trusts to let him know about a great song they’ve heard. “The truly great artists won’t really have an audience immediately — they’re slightly out of left field. People take a minute to understand and get their heads around new things or things shaped differently to anything that has gone before. And I think that’s one of the ways in which an independent label can be really great; they can provide a platform and infrastructure and the family in order to nurture that person, while everyone else in the world figures them out.” That response includes three intertwined ideas as to why Ahmed moved to Los Angeles in 2019 to launch In Real Life. The first two reflect the natures of music company infrastructure: one business, one social. In a contemporary, interdisciplinary world where managers work at labels, labels run publishing arms, and publishers employ people who are discovering and managing new artists, launching an artist service company allows him greater flexibility figuring out his relationship with those few artists he wants to work with. “There’s only a certain number of people who reach a threshold of freshness, talent and spirit that I want to work with. Being able to work with artists solely on the label side was limiting to me. In Real Life was established so I could actually work with them on other facets of their business like publishing or management if they have other plans for how they want to release music.” The social infrastructure that Ahmed wants to reimagine has everything to do with race. “I really wanted to have my own company because there aren’t enough people of color running music companies,” he says. “I find it shocking how monocultural, straight, white, and male those companies are, especially when the rosters are often very diverse. I want artists to feel like not every music company that wants to work with you looks and thinks the same. I knew what it was like to be the only non-white voice in the room when you were rolling out a record, with an artist of color; and I wanted to be able to, perhaps, more accurately reflect their wishes and finding ways of promoting their music outside of industry convention and white industry gatekeepers.” There is no doubt that when Ahmed refers to the familial potential of an independent label, he is talking about the kind of safe space some artists may not have previously experienced. So what kind of artists will In Real Life present? Much like Ahmed, the artists of In Real Life must be focused and be ready for the long haul. “We want compelling characters, people who really got something to say, who character-wise perhaps have a forcefulness and a drive and a unique talent. They will have absolute conviction about their art and about what they want to put out into the world, how you put it out into the world, how it should look and feel, and the things you want and don’t want to do. Conviction and honesty are characteristics, I think people pick up on, in this day and age. People want their artists to be uncompromising. I think that realness and rawness cuts through in a way now that maybe in the past it didn’t.” Spotify for Artists helps you to develop the fanbase you need to reach your goals.

Startups and Shit, Thinking Outside of Pandora’s Box;“And you ain’t get a coin, [Nas], you was getting fucked thenI know who I paid, God - Serchlite publishingUse your (brain)” - Jay-Z, Takeover Pandora, it turns out, is an awful business. While it’s unclear what Spotify’s unit economics look like and it may be better position, it’s currently losing a lot of cash as it grows and admits that its margins are lower than they need to be. The core issue for these companies, as well as anyone else who wants to create a mass-market music service, is that you you need the labels to get scale, and they take all the profits. While I generally think this is a shitty business, today I’m going to play devil’s advocate and suggest there may be hope for them yet. Consider that more music is recorded today annually than ever in the past. If you looked at a graph of music industry profits vs recordings over the last 20 years, you’d conclude that they were inversely related. As it turns out, they’re completely uncorrelated, but you get the idea. Great music is being recorded that is making no one money today, because no one is hearing it. But we still all listen to the same stuff from the same record labels. Why?  As it turns out, music has a network effect. Check out this amazing article from the NYT, which describes an attempt to test how hits become hits. You may also find this Planet Money piece on hit making interesting. From the NYT piece: In all the social-influence worlds, the most popular songs were much more popular (and the least popular songs were less popular) than in the independent condition. At the same time, however, the particular songs that became hits were different in different worlds, just as cumulative-advantage theory would predict. Put differently, some artists are better than others, but within the realm of good music, the hits that you need to have to make a platform work are somewhat arbitrary. We like music our friends like. We want to go to the club and hear a song we know. The advantage the record labels have had even to date, is that they have controlled discovery in the form of radio (yes, it still matters), and therefor been able to monopolize as a group — if not strictly control — what becomes a hit. Internet nerds forget the scale of terrestrial radio and its importance even today. Ask Macklemore. But the demographics of radio aside, tech music companies have achieved amazing scale today. Spotify and Pandora have on the order of 80M users each. Apple will likely catch up in the next 1-2 years. These platforms are arguably much better positioned than record labels + radio to make the hits. You can see this in the power of Spotify’s and Apple’s Discover features. These are compelling features for users and have the ability to put unknown music and artists in front of millions of users.  And given their current scale, it’s almost certainly the case that digital music companies at scale can make their own hits. If I were one of these platforms, I would make the following deal with unsigned artists. Put your music on our platform and sign a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free deal with us for all your future music. In return, we will pay you 100% of all profits for the first 10M plays with no middle man. I would then start testing tracks from my stable of Macklemores, trying to find those that work for certain segments. With that as a baseline, I would have my editors attempt to create hits/stars via Discover (et al). And while my streams of Taylor help her grow her empire at near zero profit, I would be free to take 100% of the profit on these tracks, increasing my blended margin while continuing to keep the label’s back catalogs and paying them the profits on those. And if that worked, I’d start helping my new stars complimentary products. Find service providers. Sell your merch. Book a show. Market to fans. You’re a (small) business, man. Let us help. Who needs a label? I bet there’s great margin in helping artists monetize their brands. Is this a win for the artist? It depends whether you’re Tay Tay, or Tay-Tay-living-in-obscurity. Is it a win for art? Probably. You make a lot more filling a bar with people who have heard of you than streaming online. No bar is too small for most artists. And the less power incumbents sitting on back catalogs have, the more innovation we’re likely to see in tech. That’s a good thing. It’s not clear more profit for labels has any impact on the quality or quantity of music. Is it a win for music platforms? Obviously so. If current market dynamics continue, music will become a loss leader. You see it with YouTube and Apple, and it’s likely Pandora and Spotify will end up acquired if they can’t find a business with real margins. You can’t give 100% of your profits to other companies forever, regardless of scale. The only losers here are the record label. And fuck them. I’ll close with your obligatory reminder that artists don’t make money on recorded music, never have, and never will.;https://startupljackson.com/post/131770256460/thinking-outside-of-pandoras-box;

Epidemic Sound posted $42m in net revenues in 2019 – and a $23m operating loss - Music Business Worldwide;"Epidemic Sound, the controversial Swedish production music company, saw its revenues jump significantly in 2019 – but also posted a hefty eight-figure annual operating loss. That’s according to the yearly financial report of the company’s parent, Epidemic Sound Holding AB, posted this summer in Sweden, and now obtained by MBW. Epidemic Sound AB posted net revenues of 375.3m SEK in the 2019 calendar year, equivalent to $42.1m at current exchange rates. Yet the firm saw annual operating costs more than double year-on-year, hitting 605.0m SEK ($67.9m). These operating costs included 263.3m SEK ($29.6m) spent on salaries and other staff expenses. As a result, Epidemic Sound posted an operating loss of 206.7m SEK ($23.2m) in 2019, more than double the size of operating loss it posted in the prior year period (81.9m SEK). The company’s loss before tax in 2019 weighed in at 216.4m SEK ($24.3m). Epidemic Sound’s FY 2019 net revenues were up by 66% on the 225.9m SEK it generated in net sales during FY 2018 (which, for accounting purposes, covered the 13 months from November 23, 2017 until the end of December 2018). In May this year, Epidemic Sound laid off nearly a fifth (19%) of its 419-strong worldwide workforce. At the time, the company’s founder and CEO, Oscar Oscar Höglund, told Music Ally that the redundancies were being made as part of a  “realignment” of Epidemic Sound’s business model. He further suggested that Covid-19 had “supercharged” the firm’s transition into a digital-first business. Epidemic Sound’s business model has two tiers: (i) licensing its library of rights-cleared production music to broadcasters, airlines and hotels; and (ii) generating royalties from this music on streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube, as well as licensing it to platforms like Netflix and Twitch. Many in the industry – MBW included – have raised questions over the vast amount of Epidemic Sound music appearing on Spotify playlists such as Deep Focus, Sleep and Peaceful Piano, which share millions of followers (and billions of streams) between them. A particularly controversial element of Epidemic Sound’s business is that the composers and artists it works with are barred from registering their songs with performing rights collection societies. Epidemic fully acquires the rights to these composers’ music (both recorded and publishing) via a one-off upfront payment. The company then commits to sharing streaming revenues 50/50 with the songwriters/artists in question. In the FAQs of Epidemic Sound’s website, it tells musicians: “We created a free-flowing distribution of our music for all our customers by being the sole owner of the financial rights to our music, which is not possible for us if the Music Creator is affiliated to a collecting society, due to their exclusive affiliation agreements.” It adds: “Thus, none of our Music Creators can be affiliated with any PROs/NROs or collecting societies (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SoundExchange, STIM, SAMI, etc.), while working for Epidemic.” This obviously calls into question what, if any, performing rights royalties the likes of Spotify would be required to pay out when Epidemic Sound’s music is streamed on such platforms. Late last year, widespread controversy erupted over Netflix and Discovery both seeking to use royalty-free music content in order to avoid paying performance royalties to composers. “none of our Music Creators can be affiliated with any PROs/NROs or collecting societies (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SoundExchange, STIM, SAMI, etc.), while working for Epidemic.” Epidemic Sound Discussing why it requires full ownership of its composers’ copyrights, Epidemic explains on its website: “We partner with Music Creators who value distribution over ownership so they can benefit from their music flowing freely via our powerful distribution network along with the up-front payments and 50/50 split on received streaming revenue.” Epidemic’s FY 2019 filing reveals that Netherlands-based private equity house EQT owned 38% of shares in Epidemic Sound Holding AB, as of the close of last year. Twenty percent of the company is owned by “two senior executives and other personnel within the Epidemic Sound Group”, with 41% owned by unnamed shareholders. In June this year, Epidemic Sound announced a deal to supply copyright-free music to the media library of Adobe, best known for its creative software and stock images. Epidemic Sound expanded into the US market late last year, appointing Kate Vale as its Managing Director in North America. Vale is the former MD of Spotify in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ).

Sustainable packaging trends - FreightWaves;"Quality packaging must be durable and protect goods, provide a pleasant brand experience, and stack and ship efficiently. Because of rapid e-commerce expansion and increasing concerns for the environment, companies are also looking at how to make packaging more sustainable, recyclable and minimal.  A 2020 study found that “packaging design is one of the key elements that can actively help improve supply chains, contributing to improved sustainability of logistics processes and activities.” The two main ways that packaging can become more sustainable are producing less waste and reducing emissions by increasing efficiency. Here are five sustainable packaging trends. A growing number of companies are experimenting with reusable packaging that is conducive to a circular economy. LimeLoop provides customers with lightweight, durable shipping containers designed to be used over 200 times. RePack is a reusable shipping container service that aims to replace single-use packaging. Ab InBev is striving for 100% returnable packaging or packaging made of at least 50% recycled content by 2025. Ikea has an ambition to be 100% circular by 2030. Amazon joined all four companies mentioned as a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an organization that views a circular economy as “one that is restorative and regenerative by design.”  A 2020 sustainability study said that multimodal containers and standardized packaging could contribute to more sustainable supply chains. Recognizing the most common 20-foot and 40-foot standard containers, it said the standardization of packaging, pallets and multimodal containers must work in concert to avoid wasted space during all stages of transportation. DHL wants to see shipping containers and unit load devices go collapsible. DHL’s site said collapsing or folding a container reduces the space needed for storage and transportation to about one-fourth of the original size. In an interview with FreightWaves, Emily Davis, director of sustainability at DHL Supply Chain, said the company is asking hard questions such as: “How can we make our packaging solutions more sustainable? How can we reduce the weight of materials that we’re … shipping out and reduce our fuel emissions at the same time?” Lighter packaging means lighter packages. Lighter packages means fewer greenhouse gas emissions associated with each package. Amazon said it has reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% since 2015. One of the company’s strategies to reduce emissions is through using more lightweight packaging such as plastic, which has received some backlash. Strategic box design and choosing the right-sized boxes can make a big impact on empty space and the need for box fillers. Box fillers are used to ensure packages are shipped safely and resist damage. However, companies are moving away from the most common plastic air pillows and bubble wrap. Public awareness of waste is rising, and companies are responding by switching to nonplastic, recyclable and natural fillers such as packaging paper or Greenwrap.  Minimizing empty space in boxes reduces the volume and weight of packages along with the need for fillers. This could make it easier for shippers to increase volume efficiency provided weight is not a limiting factor. The majority of plastic packaging is not recyclable or is very difficult to recycle. According to a DHL report, plastic bottles decompose after 450 years, whereas cardboard decomposes in a short two months. Several experts argue that plastics never decompose and instead break down into microplastics that harm wildlife. Recycling won’t fix the world’s waste problems, but using recyclable, nonplastic packaging such as Amazon’s padded paper mailers could help. Companies are leaning toward natural materials such as cornstarch, mushrooms and seaweed to create more eco-friendly packaging. The Swedish company PulPac is working to eliminate single-use plastics by creating a cost-effective alternative. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Alyssa Sporrer.

Bertelsmann Acquires Full Control of BMG Music Company - The New York Times;"8:41 p.m. | Updated  Bertelsmann, the 178-year-old German media giant that has been trying to remake itself for the digital age, announced on Friday that it would take control of BMG Rights Management, the music company it restarted in
                                        2008, in a deal that values BMG at $1.4 billion. Bertelsmann said it would buy the 51 percent of BMG that it did not own from its partner in the venture, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The companies did not disclose financial terms, but a person with direct knowledge of
                                        the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the purchase price was $700 million to $800 million, including the assumption of debt. The deal signals a full return to the music business for Bertelsmann, whose other media properties include Random House and the magazine publisher Gruner & Jahr. After building the first incarnation of BMG, which
                                        stood for Bertelsmann Music Group, into a global powerhouse in the 1980s and ’90s, Bertelsmann sold most of its music holdings through a series of deals with Sony and Universal in the mid-2000s. “We are bringing the music home to our group,” Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. BMG was revived in 2008, and the next year, K.K.R. made the first of its $270 million of investments in the company. BMG has made a string of acquisitions in music publishing, the side of the business that deals with
                                        copyrights for songwriting, and built a catalog of more than one million songs by artists like Johnny Cash, Carly Simon and Frank Ocean and Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. “We saw that music was going to make a comeback,” Philipp Freise, a K.K.R. partner who directs its European media business, said in an interview. “Everybody said music was going to die, but we said
                                        music will not die — it will grow.” K.K.R.’s exit after four years was not unusual for it as an investor. But some analysts said they believed that the sale could have been precipitated by BMG’s losing out on some of the biggest music auctions
                                        of the last couple of years, including Warner Music, EMI and, most recently, the Parlophone Label Group, a part of EMI that it divested itself of. (BMG has also bought some recorded music assets.) Stressing efficient administration and the licensing opportunities of a largely digital business, BMG has been a bright spot for Bertelsmann. Mr. Rabe has said that he expects BMG’s annual revenue to grow to
                                        more than $640 million in the next four to five years, up from about $390 million in 2012. Bertelsmann is also in the process of merging its Random House publishing unit with Penguin, a division of Pearson, creating the world’s largest book publisher. And in January, Bertelsmann said it wanted to sell
                                        part of its stake in the broadcasting subsidiary RTL to help finance more digital expansion. “Like any traditional media company, they need to find a digital story for the future,” said Alice Enders, a media analyst at the research firm Enders Analysis in London. “In music, once you scrap
                                        out the cost of physically producing and distributing content, what you have is a pure copyright exploitation model. That’s what BMG Rights Management is all about.” Hartwig Masuch, BMG’s chief executive, said in an interview that with Bertelsmann as its sole owner, the company could be “more aggressive moving forward” in developing its business, particularly
                                        with more recorded music rights. “What we initially envisioned for BMG was an integrated rights company based on nontraditional models,” he said. “The old world was about complex distribution structures. Now you can license multiple
                                        users and distributors. The key is not infrastructure but how good are you at monetizing and accounting for those rights.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/02/2013, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the
                                                headline: Bertelsmann to Acquire Full Control of BMG Music Unit.

$3 million funding investment for Canberra collaboration to protect our future biodiversity and biosecurity;"28 January 2021: After the devastating effects of Australia’s Black Summer, some species of our native plants and animals came close to extinction. Now, thanks to a ground-breaking collaboration between Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT), the University of Canberra and The Australian National University (ANU), an integrated big data platform powered by transformative genomics and populated with thousands of flora and fauna species will be accessible to users around the world to track the impact of events like bushfires and assist with the management of our natural ecosystems. Canberra-based company DArT will invest $3 million to develop the platform, $1.2 million of which will come from the ACT Government’s Priority Investment Program, to support the cross-university collaboration. Assistant Minister for Economic Development Tara Cheyne said the ACT Government’s Priority Investment Program invests in projects that connect industry, research and the tertiary education sector to attract investment and grow established and emerging priority areas of Canberra’s economy. “This platform that has been built by local Canberra company DArT will turbo-charge the research capabilities of people working in plant and animal biodiversity conservation, natural resource management, agri-technology and biosecurity. “This means researchers and scientists will be better able to understand the impacts of events like bushfires and climate change on plants and animals by accessing data from around the world that would otherwise be lost. “The project will create up to 10 new jobs and is a wonderful example of local collaboration between our tertiary education sectors and local industry,” said Minister Cheyne. Building on the success of its past 20 years, DArT, based at the University of Canberra, has accumulated a hundred years’ worth of genetic data in plants and animals. It has teamed up with the University and the ANU to establish the big data analysis platform, which government agencies, the resources industry and researchers can access to better manage our environment’s valuable ecology. “Genomic data from plants and animals can be powerful when it comes to managing our environments – however, if we can combine it with other environmental data and apply the latest advances in big data analytics, then the understanding we can generate is significantly magnified,” said DArT Director, Dr Andrzej Kilian. “DNA itself is only one piece of the puzzle. The Internet of Things and other sources of environmental data are also extremely valuable and, when combined with DNA data, provide a rich variety of information to enable us to assess the alarming decreases in biodiversity and biosecurity.” The big data platform will enable the tracking of changes in biodiversity to facilitate better management of environmental and other impacts on ecosystems. A significant part of the project is already underway, focusing on the impact of the Black Summer bushfires in 2019-20. Researchers had previously collected data before the bushfires hit and have returned to the impacted areas to collect further data. The platform will help identify what plant and animal species died and what has recovered. The technology will also help large resource companies to map the ecology of the areas they are working in, assisting them to meet their environmental obligations. Development of the platform in Canberra and its subsequent international commercialisation will produce high-value, knowledge-based jobs for the local economy, making Canberra a leader in the development of this technology worldwide. This is the power of combining the knowledge and expertise that exists of universities with the innovation and agility of local high-techcompanies. Acting University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor, Professor Geoff Crisp said the University’s contribution to this important project derives from a long-standing collaboration with DArT. “Imagine the significance of this platform in helping to save our ecosystems,” he said. “The University of Canberra is excited to further strengthen our relationship with a local company that is doing ground-breaking research, both in Australia and internationally. “We are excited to help implement the big data analysis platform so the research and development community can collectively better manage biodiversity and biosecurity.” ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt said that we must innovate and collaborate to protect Australia’s incredible biodiversity from catastrophic events, such as Black Summer bushfires, as they become more frequent and destructive. “As the national university, ANU is committed to projects that build Australia’s resilience and capabilities for the future. We’re proud to contribute our established expertise in biology data sciences and our brightest students to this initiative. ""I want to thank the ACT Government for investing in this vital work to grow data science capability in Canberra, which will help save species from extinction across the globe. “We are excited to work with UC and the ACT Government on this important project.”";https://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/media/newsroom/2021/january/$3-million-funding-investment-for-canberra-collaboration-to-protect-our-future-biodiversity-and-biosecurity;
Researchers Develop Method to Create 3D ‘Map’ of Tissue Structure and Function;"A newly published approach to profiling human tissue samples can build a 3D picture of structure and function at the molecular level. The procedure marries techniques from chemistry, biology, and data science and could help doctors design precision therapies in the coming years for patients who aren’t responding to treatment. In a study of human tonsil tissue, the researchers combined a labeling scheme using isotopes to “tag” specific kinds of cells — in this case, immune cells such as T-cells and B-cells — with imaging mass spectrometry that can identify metabolites, the molecules around those cells that are used for various metabolic functions. And instead of doing this on a single, two-dimensional “slice” of tissue, they used data from about 150 slices to create a 3D map of the tissue. “An analogy to our system is actually geography: We create the geography of tonsils — where are the valleys, where are the mountains. But when we are doing that, we are looking at more granular features, [including] which molecular distributions are around, and how do they really change within this tonsil tissue,” said Ahmet Coskun, Bernie Marcus Early Career Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. “Typically, the metabolites are measured in one experiment, and these protein-specific labels are measured in another, separate experiment. Bringing the two together in a unique, single measurement is one of the advantages here,” he said. Coskun’s team used tools from data science to turn all of that data into a 3D map of the tonsil tissue, which Coskun said is more accurate since the tissues are three-dimensional themselves. They described their unique approach — combining two disparate measurements into a single test and processing a huge amount of data to make a 3D map — Jan. 27 in the journal Science Advances. They call the technique a “3D Spatially resolved Metabolomic profiling Framework.” “You've seen in hospitals how MRIs are done — they can make entire body 3D. That's not done at the microscale, unfortunately,” Coskun said. “When you look at microscale things, they're just two-dimensional slices most of the time.” Coskun and his team studied B-cells in tonsils, important harbingers of a potential infection. Tonsils are one of the first areas that sense a foreign bacteria or virus, and the immune cells there warn the body to prepare to fight an invader. The team’s spatial map showed the locations of T-cell and B-cell concentrations. It also discovered lower concentrations of specific kinds of fat molecules called lipids that the B-cells use to proliferate and create antibodies. In experiments looking at nearly 200 different kinds of metabolites and lipids, the researchers uncovered a unique “code” that identified where specific lipids related to different kinds of cell function were depleted. “That is information you can use to understand how tonsils respond to outside foreign objects that are interfering our bodies,” Coskun said, “and then how those specific anatomical regions in tonsils use their metabolites and lipid content to respond to them.” Understanding structure and function in conjunction also can pinpoint how cells are using energy, depleting oxygen, or otherwise working in the body, he noted. “You can use this information to design precision therapies and to find the best drugs for that specific person,” Coskun said. “Drug libraries attack this specific mechanism or that specific mechanism, so by comparing the drug libraries and a specific patient's structure and function profiles, you can actually design personalized drugs for that specific patient.” That’s still a few years down the road — Coskun said the specialized machines his team used to develop the metabolic profiling are still expensive and mostly housed in research centers. But: “The biochemical methods that we developed, they're easy; they can be done in any lab,” he said. “Getting the measurements done is the rate-limiting step here.” Coskun said he could imagine a centralized service where healthcare providers send patient samples for testing — akin to how genetic sequencing is done now. But as technology advances and the machines get cheaper, he said they could end up in more and more hospitals. His team also is developing a cheaper, custom device to overcome the limitations of requiring costly, relatively rare equipment to employ his team’s approach. “Our goal is discovery. We'd like to use this machine to survey a number of patients who respond to certain drugs and who don't respond to certain drugs,” Coskun said. “We'd like to compare these groups of patients for a personalized therapy approach. We want to make the framework from our end, so that it's ready for clinicians to adapt later.” Coskun’s team on the study included graduate students Shambavi Ganesh, Thomas Hu, Mayar Allam, and Shuangyi Cai as well as Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology researchers Eric Woods and Walter Henderson. Already, Coskun and his collaborators are exploring what his 3D profiling approach can tell researchers about lung and prostate cancers, visualizing how immunotherapies affect the interplay between the immune system and tumors. “There are cancer cells and immune cells, and we'd like to understand why and how they're interacting, and then, when they come together, what happens to the structure and function in what we call the tumor microenvironment,” he said. “If you understand the structure and function of that tumor macroenvironment better, then you can trace back which mechanisms worked or haven't worked.” This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health K25 Career Development Award K25AI140783, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and the Bernie Marcus Early Career Professorship.

An Ontology of Evil;In January 2019, a family in southern Spain was subject to a nightmare scenario. During a family walk near Malaga, two-year-old Julen Rosseló fell 71 meters down a 25cm-wide borehole. He didn’t survive, and it took thirteen days for rescuers to recover his body. Later it was revealed the borehole had been dug illegally. At the time, my own daughter was the same age, which led me to follow the story with a growing sense of horror and disbelief that such things could be allowed to happen. It seems absurd that something so truly awful could happen to anyone, let alone a child. Yet real life horror stories such as this happen all too frequently. For atheists like myself, they represent the precarious fragility of life in a universe governed by uncaring physical laws. Simple, brutal death by physics. Yet for Christians around the world, suffering and harm present a more nuanced problem — a challenge to faith. The problem of evil is perhaps the greatest challenge to Christian religious belief. It is an unavoidable part of life that we all encounter evil and suffering in one sense or another. As a consequence, it is a natural human response to ask why we suffer and why evil exists in the world. The problem for Christianity can be stated as follows: Christianity is rooted in the existence of evil and suffering, from Job to the sacrificial nature of Jesus. Yet, Christianity holds that God is infinitely loving, powerful and knowing. This is the so-called ‘inconsistent triad’. It is incumbent on Christians to reconcile not just why evil should exist — this isn’t too difficult — but why so much evil exists. A failure to resolve the problem of evil leads to one of two undesirable outcomes for believers. Firstly, it may be that either God doesn’t exist or exists but without the recognizable characteristics of the Christian God — indifferent or with limited power, for instance. Secondly, it may that Christian belief is irrational in the light of evil. Whilst some might be happy to acknowledge this (Kierkegaard springs to mind), I suspect the majority of Christians alive today would not. In this article, I will focus on an aspect rarely scrutinized in detail — the nature of evil itself. For a general overview and introduction to the debate as a whole, there are other excellent articles covering this angle in more detail. The nature of evil is a complex and nuanced area too often glossed over in a rush to present or evaluate the defenses and theodicies. I believe that without a full and developed appreciation of the problem itself, we cannot fully judge the success (or failure) of the responses. Furthermore, I will argue that the lessons of legal theory, evolutionary biology, and data science show that most religious responses fail to address the most difficult issues.;https://medium.com/the-philosophers-stone/an-ontology-of-evil-8ed1cf95fda7;
Sharper signals: how machine learning is cleaning up microscopy images;Saskia Lippens was satisfied with the images she was feeding into a program to identify borders between cells and organelles at the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB) in Belgium. So she hesitated when graduate student Joris Roels offered to use an algorithm to filter out the noise from the input micrographs, even though he said it would improve her border-finding results. “An electron microscopist is always a little bit cautious when people talk about restoration of images,” says Lippens, director of the institute’s microscopy core facility in Ghent. “What if we’re changing data? What if we make mistakes?” Roels, now a postdoctoral researcher at the VIB, convinced her by promising that a human biologist would always look over the computer’s shoulder, checking the images and selecting the right de-noising approach. When Lippens tried to find those borders again using de-noised pictures, she was impressed with the improvement. “This was really a much better starting point,” she says. ‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures Noise, put simply, is everything in an image that isn’t real signal. The weaker the illumination, the noisier the image, which explains the graininess of night-time mobile-phone selfies — not to mention low-light photomicrographs taken to protect fragile samples. But no image is completely free of noise. “It’s always there,” says Michael Elad, a computer scientist at the Technion — Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. To minimize it, researchers have long applied de-noising algorithms, the earliest incarnations of which were mathematical processes developed by computer scientists. “Then came the deep-learning era,” says Elad. By passing the images to computers and allowing them to work out the best de-noising approach, researchers have begun to see striking results. “It’s pretty magical,” says Loïc Royer, who works on image processing and light-sheet microscopy at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, California. But the magic does have risks: biologists must take care not to lose or muddle valuable signal. From human to machine Old-school, human-written algorithms still work well much of the time, and many have been built into popular image-processing environments, such as ImageJ, Fiji and MATLAB. Elad favours an approach called block-matching and 3D filtering, which groups together image sections that are similar in content and noise, and filters noise from each group before reassembling the image. Carolina Wählby, director of the national SciLifeLab BioImage Informatics Facility at Uppsala University in Sweden, uses an algorithm called Top-Hat to clean up background noise in fluorescence micrographs and other images. (Top-Hat performs a mathematical transformation to remove overly bright or dark elements from an image.) “In many cases, something simple like that works really well,” she says. Machine learning goes a step further, with the computer first learning how to de-noise one set of images, then applying what it has learnt to new data. “You skip the middleman, the mathematician,” says Royer. There is one catch, however: the computer’s reasoning isn’t always apparent. “The learning algorithm is building a very complex black box that extracts the essence of what the images are about, and it just works,” says Royer. Deep learning takes on tumours There’s also the added computational cost, particularly during the training phase. Timely training might require computers linked to multiple graphics processing units or cloud-based servers. However, once the machine has finished this phase, researchers can usually de-noise images with a standard laptop, says Avinash Nehemiah, who manages computer-vision product marketing at MathWorks, the developer of MATLAB, in Natick, Massachusetts. In ‘supervised’ learning-based approaches, the machine knows what it is looking for, because the user trains it with matching pairs of noisy and clean images. “Supervised, with the right data, will always give you the best results,” says Florian Jug, a computer scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany. Supervised models get better as users provide more input pairs. But researchers don’t always have pre-cleaned images available. In that case, they can try algorithms that train themselves. According to Jun Xu, a computer scientist at Nankai University in Tianjin, China: “The new direction of this field is the development of self-supervised algorithms.” Wave of the future Some of the first entrants in this self-supervised category, Noise2Void and Noise2Self, were developed in the past few years. The developers assume that every pixel value is a bit off owing to random noise, but that nearby pixels should offer strong hints as to what the value should be, explains Royer, who co-developed Noise2Self. For each pixel, the machine uses the surrounding pixels to predict the proper value. It can then apply those parameters to new pictures. “The noise doesn’t survive this process, because the noise is information that is only on that pixel,” says Royer.;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00023-0;
Can an AI Predict the Language of Viral Mutation?;"VIRUSES LEAD A rather repetitive existence. They enter a cell, hijack its machinery to turn it into a viral copy machine, and those copies head on to other cells armed with instructions to do the same. So it goes, over and over again. But somewhat often, amidst this repeated copy-pasting, things get mixed up. Mutations arise in the copies. Sometimes, a mutation means an amino acid doesn’t get made and a vital protein doesn’t fold—so into the dustbin of evolutionary history that viral version goes. Sometimes the mutation does nothing at all, because different sequences that encode the same proteins make up for the error. But every once in a while, mutations go perfectly right. The changes don’t affect the virus’s ability to exist; instead, they produce a helpful change, like making the virus unrecognizable to a person’s immune defenses. When that allows the virus to evade antibodies generated from past infections or from a vaccine, that mutant variant of the virus is said to have “escaped.” Scientists are always on the lookout for signs of potential escape. That’s true for SARS-CoV-2, as new strains emerge and scientists investigate what genetic changes could mean for a long-lasting vaccine. (So far, things are looking okay.) It’s also what confounds researchers studying influenza and HIV, which routinely evade our immune defenses. So in an effort to see what’s possibly to come, researchers create hypothetical mutants in the lab and see if they can evade antibodies taken from recent patients or vaccine recipients. But the genetic code offers too many possibilities to test every evolutionary branch the virus might take over time. It’s a matter of keeping up. Last winter, Brian Hie, a computational biologist at MIT and a fan of the lyric poetry of John Donne, was thinking about this problem when he alighted upon an analogy: What if we thought of viral sequences the way we think of written language? Every viral sequence has a sort of grammar, he reasoned—a set of rules it needs to follow in order to be that particular virus. When mutations violate that grammar, the virus reaches an evolutionary dead end. In virology terms, it lacks “fitness.” Also like language, from the immune system’s perspective, the sequence could also be said to have a kind of semantics. There are some sequences the immune system can interpret—and thus stop the virus with antibodies and other defenses—and some that it can’t. So a viral escape could be seen as a change that preserves the sequence’s grammar but changes its meaning. The analogy had a simple, almost too simple, elegance. But to Hie, it was also practical. In recent years, AI systems have gotten very good at modeling principles of grammar and semantics in human language. They do this by training a system with data sets of billions of words, arranged in sentences and paragraphs, from which the system derives patterns. In this way, without being told any specific rules, the system learns where the commas should go and how to structure a clause. It can also be said to intuit the meaning of certain sequences—words and phrases—based on the many contexts in which they appear throughout the data set. It’s patterns, all the way down. That’s how the most advanced language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-3, can learn to produce perfectly grammatical prose that manages to stay reasonably on topic. One advantage of this idea is that it’s generalizable. To a machine learning model, a sequence is a sequence, whether it’s arranged in sonnets or amino acids. According to Jeremy Howard, an AI researcher at the University of San Francisco and a language model expert, applying such models to biological sequences can be fruitful. With enough data from, say, genetic sequences of viruses known to be infectious, the model will implicitly learn something about how infectious viruses are structured. “That model will have a lot of sophisticated and complex knowledge,” he says. Hie knew this was the case. His graduate advisor, computer scientist Bonnie Berger, had previously done similar work with another one of her lab's members, using AI to predict protein folding patterns. So this spring, Berger's lab tried out Hie’s analogy, and the results are out today in Science. At first, the team had been interested in influenza and HIV, which are both notorious for evading vaccines. But when they began their lab work in March, sequences from the novel coronavirus were becoming available, so they decided to add those in as well. For all three viruses, they homed in on sequences for the proteins the viruses use to enter cells and replicate, explains Bryan Bryson, a professor of biological engineering at MIT and a coauthor of the research. These also happen to be primary immune system and vaccine targets. They’re the places where antibodies latch on, preventing the virus from entering a cell and marking it for destruction. (For SARS-CoV-2, that’s the spike protein.) For each of the viruses, the MIT team trained a language model using the genetic sequence data instead of the usual paragraphs and sentences.

Sequences deemed to have similar “meanings” should infect the same hosts, the researchers reasoned. The genetic language of a swine flu would be semantically more similar to another swine flu than a flu that normally infects humans. They were pleased to see that this was the case—and also to find that certain strains that had spilled from one species to another in the real world, like avian flu in 1918 and 2009, were scored as semantically similar. Then they checked the grammar. How well did a sequence’s “grammar” score correspond to how viable a virus was in real-world conditions? The researchers gathered data from past research quantifying the fitness of various mutants—how well they binded to or replicated in cells—for all three viruses, and then examined how grammatical the model believed those sequences to be. Grammaticality seemed to be a good proxy for their fitness. But Bryson and Hie wanted to know if combining the two proxies could predict viral escape. When they compared their model’s predictions to prior known instances of actual viral escape, the influenza model was the most predictive. That wasn’t surprising, because the data set they used to train the model was particularly large, including years’ worth of influenza sequences and a wealth of mutations known to sneak past the human immune system. For SARS-CoV-2, they checked their predictions against escape mutants that had been artificially derived, passed through antibody-rich serum until the selection pressure produced mutants that could evade the antibodies. (In other words, not anything we currently need to worry about in the real world.) The correlation was looser. The model flagged most of the true escapees but also sequences that weren’t. Still, it’s a start that could give virologists a better grip on where natural mutations are headed. “This is a phenomenal way of narrowing down the entire universe of potential mutant viruses,” says Benhur Lee, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the work. The predictions are only as good as the data that goes into it, he adds. And as the researchers note, that means the model misses certain nuances, because escape is not always only a function of mutations the virus acquires. HIV is a good example. Sometimes, the sequence doesn’t change, and viral proteins are still recognized by antibodies, but those proteins are shielded by a type of sugary compound called a glycan.";https://www.wired.com/story/can-an-ai-predict-the-language-of-viral-mutation/;
OHIO professors advance international astronaut and space biology research;"Ohio University faculty are part of a team of researchers who have published a special compilation of papers that is being described as the largest set of astronaut and space biology data ever produced. Nathaniel Szewczyk, Ph.D., professor of molecular medicine at the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, and Sarah Wyatt, Ph.D., professor of environmental and plant biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, coauthored six of 29 papers recently published by NASA in a special compilation of Cell Press journal articles called “The biology of spaceflight.” The OHIO researchers are among more than 200 investigators from dozens of academic, government, aerospace and industry groups to contribute to the articles. The effort brought together a unique collaboration across the four largest space agencies in the world – NASA, JAXA, ESA and ROSCOSMOS – with research spanning longitudinal multi-omic profiling, single-cell immune and epitope mapping, novel radiation countermeasures and detailed biochemical profiles of 56 astronauts. Szewczyk, who also holds the Heritage Endowed Professorship in Molecular Medicine, Osteopathic Heritage Foundation Ralph S. Licklider, D.O., Research Endowment, coauthored the papers, “Comparative transcriptomics identifies neuronal and metabolic adaptations to hypergravity and microgravity in Caenorhabditis elegans”; “A New Era for Space Life Science: International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP)”; and “Revamping Space-omics in Europe.” He and Wyatt coauthored the paper, “NASA GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline: Standardized Processing of Short-Read RNA-Seq Data.” Some of the groundbreaking work reported in these papers used NASA’s GeneLab, a repository for all genomics data related to space flight and gravity. The GeneLab is intended to be used by scientists to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses for determining systemic biological responses occurring in spaceflight. Space biologists around the world rely on these omics data to maximize the knowledge gained from spaceflight experiments. “The GeneLab was set up to analyze large data sets of molecules that change in response to space flight, and continues to collect existing data from the past, as well as generates new data from ongoing flights,” Szewczyk explained. “There is a push to look at whether we can use such data sets to better understand astronaut health and to see what lessons can be learned in similar experiments.” Wyatt learned about the GeneLab after working on her first space flight experiment in 2015 and decided to use her OHIO Faculty Fellowship Leave to work with NASA developing the GeneLab more and helping establish it as a place for accessible data. “Sarah was truly invaluable in setting up GeneLab’s agenda,” said Sigrid Reinsch, Ph.D., principal investigator and research scientist at NASA-Ames Research Center. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups have also developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline is all publicly available through the GeneLab database. “The GeneLab’s pipeline is a fantastic opportunity for scientists and anyone interested in the data to have easy access to the results and to use this information to compare experiments,” Wyatt said. “When we looked at the data sets from previous experiments, we knew we needed to integrate and expand them so others could utilize this data. I’m excited to see NASA take this on and publish the details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline, as well as to see a former Ph.D. student of mine, Colin Kruse, as an author on this paper.” Kruse graduated with a Ph.D. from OHIO’s interdisciplinary graduate program in molecular and cellular biology in 2019, a program which Wyatt also directs. He is currently a post-doc at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Most of Wyatt’s research includes her work with gravitational biology and how plants respond to gravity. She has conducted experiments, while at OHIO, sending plants into space to see how genes are regulated in response to spaceflight and will do so again on a flight mission slated for May. Szewczyk also has a spaceflight experiment slated to launch on the same mission as Wyatt’s, making it the first time two OHIO professors will have experiments launching on the same mission.";https://www.ohio.edu/news/2021/01/ohio-professors-advance-international-astronaut-and-space-biology-research;
DEC launches ice fishing survey on Lake Champlain;"The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos has announced an ice fishing creel survey, conducted on the waters of Lake Champlain until March 2021. The survey is part of a two-year effort to gather data from both ice and open water anglers to server as a foundation to help DEC Fisheries to better understand their expectations. The survey’s will also benefit management actions on Lake Champlain. The DEC will survey 4 access points: The Plattsburgh Boat Launch on Cumberland Bay; Willsboro Bay Boat Launch; Bulwagga Bay Campground; and South Bay Boat Launch. As anglers finish off a day of fishing, they will be asked to participate by providing information about that day and allowing for creel agents to collect biological data about their catches, including target species, the number caught, and the size. Participation is voluntary and gives those who choose to engage a chance to help Lake Champlain make more informed management decisions.

Partition Quantitative Assessment (PQA): A quantitative methodology to assess the embedded noise in clustered omics and systems biology data;"Identifying groups that share common features among datasets through clustering analysis is a typical problem in many fields of science, particularly in post-omics and systems biology research. In respect of this, quantifying how a measure can cluster or organize intrinsic groups is important since currently there is no statistical evaluation of how ordered is, or how much noise is embedded in the resulting clustered vector. Many of the literature focuses on how well the clustering algorithm orders the data, with several measures regarding external and internal statistical measures; but none measure has been developed to statistically quantify the noise in an arranged vector posterior a clustering algorithm, i.e., how much of the clustering is due to randomness. Here, we present a quantitative methodology, based on autocorrelation, to assess this problem.";https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2101.03228;
Enzolytics Announces The Discovery Of Seven Newly Identified Conserved Target Sites On The HIV Virus;Company begins process of identifying conserved/immutable target sites on SARS-CoV-2 (the CoronaVirus) and other developments COLLEGE STATION, TX / ACCESSWIRE / February 1, 2021 / Enzolytics, Inc. (OTC PINK:ENZC)(the “Company”) today announced it has identified seven additional conserved, expectedly immutable sites on the HIV virus against which it plans to produce targeted anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies. The Company’s primary anti-HIV monoclonal antibody targets one conserved site on the HIV virus, which site is 98% conserved (either directly or by way of conservative amino acid substitutions) over all 87,336 HIV isolates which have now been curated (analyzed) by the Company using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additional conserved target sites (some with 98% conserved sequences) have now been identified against which fully human anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies will be produced in its lab on the campus of Texas A&M University in the University’s Institute for Preclinical Studies. The significance of producing multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting multiple conserved sites is recognized by experts as a critical approach to effective therapy. This allows the administration of a “cocktail” of antibodies, all targeting conserved and expectedly immutable sites. Additionally, the Company’s Genetics and Molecular Biology data science team is now screening (using computer analysis/Artificial Intelligence [AI]) more than 275,000 CoronaVirus isolates now known, to also identify conserved sites which expectedly are immutable. From this information, anti-SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVirus) monoclonal antibodies will be produced. The significance of producing monoclonal antibodies against conserved target sites on targeted viruses is made evident by the mutant strains of the CoronaVirus currently surfacing in the U.S, South Africa, Brazil, United Kingdom and around the world. The same virus mutation exists with HIV, as well as other well-known viruses. As a virus mutates, a therapeutic becomes ineffective when it neutralizes by attacking a site that changes. By targeting an immutable site, a therapeutic is not affected by the mutation. This is well understood by the necessity to produce a new flu vaccine with each flu season, namely because the flu virus mutates. Producing therapeutics that target a conserved site on viruses makes possible the production of a therapeutic that is not rendered ineffective by virus mutation, and therefore can be applied successfully both universally around the world and durably over time. The Company is also applying Artificial Intelligence [AI] to scan the hundreds of thousands of isolates that exist in 14 other prevalent viruses, ranging from influenza to Rabies to Ebola. Using the Company’s proprietary technique for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies directed against these infectious diseases, the Company will produce multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against these viruses. The significance of this approach is well recognized by experts in virology due to the ability of all viruses to mutate and render ineffective initially developed therapeutics. Production of the Company’s primary anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies is underway at Genscript Labs. Testing of these newly produced monoclonal antibodies is scheduled for early 2021 at the University of Strasbourg in Strasbourg France. Thereafter, Macaque trials are planned at the California National Primate Research Center, Univ. of California, Davis, CA. Additional information on the progress and Company facilities will be part of the new Company website expected to be rolled out in the coming days. In addition, the Company offers this update on its progress toward FDA approval of ENZC’s licensed ITV-1 Immunotherapy treatment previously tested in human trials in Bulgaria. On April 29, 2019, Bulgaria, as a member of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), was recognized under the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) between the FDA and European Union for medicinal products for human use subject to limitations. This allows drug inspectors to rely upon information from drug inspections conducted within countries recognized under the Treaty. The limitations stated on the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Website, listed as current as of 5/08/2020, read as follows: “The capability determinations apply to routine surveillance inspections. In the future the following product and inspection types may be included in the coverage of the agreement, pending further consideration: Vaccines for human use Plasma derived pharmaceuticals Investigational products (clinical trial material) Veterinary products Excluded from the MRA scope are: Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), human blood, human plasma, human tissues and organs and veterinary immunologicals.” To establish the effect of this new directive on the Company, Company representatives visited Sofia, Bulgaria last month and met with the Executive Director of Bulgarian Drug Administration (BDA) to determine how this treaty affects the use of the Company’s ITV-1 immunotherapy treatment which was successful in clinical trials completed in 2016. This meeting was followed by a meeting with a Clinical Research Organization, Clinic Design, in Sofia. The Company believes, and is currently reviewing the applicable information, that with the BDA recognition under the MRA and its membership in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), its Immunotherapy treatment should qualify for recognition by the FDA once the Clinical Trial process and Validation order have been completed. The Company has been informed that the inclusion of the BDA in the EMA restricted the permitting of our Treatment by the BDA and the permitting will now be done by the EMA for all the European Union. As a result, some, if not all of the clinical trials may need to be completed under the EMA standards. The company is evaluating the necessary steps and cost for the FDA submission under the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the FDA and EMA. Based on this information, the Company took the following actions. On January 28th, a notice of default and termination was registered with the courts in Sofia of the Sub License Agreement issued to IMMB BG. The company has entered into negotiations with a supportive group in Bulgaria to form a new entity and enter a funding agreement to cover any new cost of clinical trials under EMA standards and permitting by the EMA. Strategically, the Company believes that the actions will be cost effective resulting in a significant advancement of the Company’s therapeutic portfolio. As stated in the year end update, proposals were recently requested from several PCAOB accounting firms to provide quotes for Audits of the Company’s current and prior year Financial Statements in order to become fully reporting. The Company has engaged MaloneBailey, LLC of Houston, Texas as its PCAOB accounting firm and has begun the audit process. It is still the Company’s plan to complete the two-year audit as quickly as possible but will file the December 31, 2021 Annual Report Financial Statements pursuant to the OTC Markets Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines immediately upon completion to allow time to complete the two-year audits and remain current with our filings. CEO Charles Cotropia stated, “The Company is making significant progress on both of its therapeutic platforms: first, on the identification of prime target sites on both the CoronaVirus and the HIV virus and the creation of neutralizing antibodies directed against these sites, and second, on advancing its ITV-1 peptide therapeutic for patient application in the EU.” CSO Harry Zhabilov stated, “With the Bulgarian Drug Administration joining the European Medicine Agency and being recognized under the Mutual Recognition Agreement with the FDA, once we have successfully finished the permitting process the Company will be able to pursue FDA approval for ITV-1. We are currently investigating the required steps but feel confident that this is a viable option for the ITV-1 patented therapy.”;https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/science-business-technology-products-and-services-eastern-europe-ac99d227eeda9b45325f5500fceee67c;
Methylation of the D2 dopamine receptor affects binding with the human regulatory proteins Par-4 and Calmodulin;"Protein arginine methylation is a post-translational modification that contributes to the regulation of many cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction (Bedford and Richard 2005). In 2003, a large-scale proteomics analysis identified a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as potentially being arginine methylated (Boisvert et al. 2003). However, the effect of methylation on these receptors was not examined. Functional evidence that protein arginine methylation regulates GPCR signaling was first reported for the D2-like dopamine GPCR family (the human D2 and C. elegans DOP-3 receptors) (Likhite et al. 2015), and later for the C. elegans SER-2 tyramine receptor (Bowitch et al. 2018). Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) methylated a peptide fragment corresponding to a region of the third intracellular loop (3rd ICL) of each of these receptors in vitro, while changing the conserved arginines in this region to alanine reduced receptor methylation (Likhite et al.2015; Bowitch et al. 2018). In cell culture, mutating the conserved putative methylation motif of human D2 decreased signaling via the receptor, leading to a decrease in D2-mediated inhibition of cAMP (Likhite et al. 2015). This, combined with behavioral studies in C. elegans, suggested that protein arginine methylation promotes D2-like dopamine receptor signaling (Likhite et al. 2015). However, the mechanism by which it does so is unknown. The two arginine residues (Arg217 and Arg219) that we identified as methylation targets within the amino-terminal region of the 3rd ICL of human D2 (Likhite et al. 2015) lie within the overlapping binding sites of Par-4 [prostate apoptosis response 4 protein, also known as pro-apoptotic WT1 regulator (PAWR)] and CaM (calmodulin) (Bofill-Cardona et al. 2000; Park et al. 2005) (Figure 1A). The two proteins compete for binding to D2, with CaM displacing Par-4 in a calcium-dependent manner (Park et al. 2005). Whereas Par-4 binding facilitated D2 inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Park et al. 2005), CaM binding to D2N (a peptide corresponding to the first 19 amino acids of D2’s third intracellular loop) selectively blocked G protein activation (Bofill-Cardona et al. 2000). The opposing activities for Par-4 and CaM are consistent with their competition for binding to D2. We sought to determine whether arginine methylation could regulate D2 signaling by altering the binding of Par-4 and/or CaM to D2. Specifically, as arginine methylation of D2 was proposed to promote D2 signaling (Likhite et al.2015), we hypothesized that it might either enhance Par-4 binding, or diminish CaM binding, to D2. We performed anisotropy experiments using purified recombinant human Par-4 or human CaM, with fluorescently-labeled unmethylated or methylated D2 peptide (corresponding to amino acids 208-243 of human D2), to determine binding constants. Unexpectedly, although Par-4 bound to the unmethylated D2 peptide with an average Kd = 21.6 ± 6.8 nM, no binding was observed in the presence of the methylated D2 peptide (Figure 1B). This suggests that methylation of the D2 receptor may actually serve to abrogate its interaction with Par-4, perhaps to allow binding of an alternative (unidentified) promoter of D2 signaling. However, consistent with the model that arginine methylation may modulate D2 receptor signaling in part by decreasing its interaction with CaM, we found that CaM bound more strongly to the unmethylated D2 peptide (average Kd = 57.5 ± 8.2 nM) than to the methylated D2 peptide (average Kd = 135.9 ± 16.5 nM). Combined, we have demonstrated that the methylation status of a peptide fragment of the 3rd ICL of D2 influences interaction with two known modulators of D2 receptor signaling, Par-4 and CaM, in vitro. Future cell-based experiments to examine the effect of arginine methylation on full-length D2 receptor interaction with cytoplasmic regulators will provide additional insights into the mechanism by which this post-translational modification may promote D2-mediated dopamine signaling.";https://www.micropublication.org/journals/biology/micropub-biology-000366;

AI can now learn to manipulate human behaviou;Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making. It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing. There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse. How AI can learn to influence human behaviour A team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer. The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time. In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%. Read more: If machines can beat us at games, does it make them more intelligent than us? The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode. In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions. In experiments, an AI system successfully learned to influence human decisions. Shutterstock What the research means for the future of AI These findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society. But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us. Read more: Australians have low trust in artificial intelligence and want it to be better regulated The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices. The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail). What’s next? Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey. AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential. Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.;https://theconversation.com/ai-can-now-learn-to-manipulate-human-behaviour-155031;
Bioinformatics: The Fascinating Marriage of Data Science and Biology;Data science is changing the future of the field of biology. Last year, the data visualization market for biology was estimated to be worth $808 million One of the newest applications of data science in biology is in the arena of bioinformatics. Data Science is the Future of Biology ?Simple? may be a bit of a stretch when explaining anything that revolves around biological data and genetic codes, but the big-picture view of bioinformatics can, at least, help depict the importance of them regarding issues that the world faces, including the ongoing battle against COVID-19. Data science has been integral to the field of biology for years. It has been used in synthetic biology and other applications before. However, some of the newer applications of bioinformatics are even more fascinating. The Oxford dictionary definition of bioinformatics is ?the science of collecting and analyzing complex biological data such as genetic codes,? but that still doesn?t completely answer the question of ?What is bioinformatics?? Here is a baseline look at the study and practical uses of bioinformatics. The Crossroads of Science As the name would suggest, bioinformatics is a science involving parts of biology and data science (i.e., informatics). Data science is affecting the progression and accuracy of processes in fields from video games to medicine and everything in between, and when coupling the analysis capabilities of data science with the research and development capabilities of a field like biology, a lot of good can be done in a short amount of time. For something like COVID-19, for instance, the study of epidemics fused with the study of information resulted in a marriage of epidemiology and biostatistics that helped inform researches on creating vaccines, as well as distributing them efficiently. Bioinformatics is a similar marriage, with biology being the science and informatics being the data analysis. Economics The data industry, in general, has been steadily progressing in the past decade, more and more each year. In the last five years, the industry value has grown from $122 billion to more than $200 billion, and is expected to reach ~$275 billion by the end of 2022. With this rapid growth, investments in all sectors of the data world are abundant, and bioinformatics is very much included. With realizations that there are many areas where bioinformatics have yet to be utilized, the market is expected to triple in size by 2025, to an estimated $19.8 billion. It is a major breakthrough in data visualizations. It?s probably no surprise that advancements in medicine are leading this charge, financially, but the Biden Administration has also made pledges to fund data science research relative to healthcare, meaning the growth in this industry could become even more exponential if it continues to prove itself as a worthy investment. Uses Perhaps the easiest way to understand something is to see it in action, and here are 3 ways scientists are utilizing bioinformatics today: Genomics ? Genomics researchers utilize bioinformatics to speed up processes related to analyzing DNA sequences, ultimately helping inform teams looking to combat a given disease. COVID vaccines and cancer research are two areas of genomics greatly enhanced by bioinformatics. Drugs ? In a similar vein as vaccines and future cancer treatments, current pharmaceuticals can also become more efficient with the almost-instant analyzation capabilities afforded by bioinformatics. Proteomics ? Proteomics also came into play with COVID responses, as the virus affected certain proteins found in the organism known as humans. Being able to evaluate proteomic data on a grand scale, helps scientists determine efficacy issues in response to infections that affect the proteome of a species. Growth As mentioned before, the economic growth of the bioinformatics industry is expected to be rapid, but the reason for this is the rapidness with which the industry is expected to grow regarding utilization. Though already booming, the areas of science that have yet to really be able to utilize bioinformatics (likely due to funding) outnumber those that already are, meaning a lot of potential for growth on many, many levels.;https://www.smartdatacollective.com/bioinformatics-the-fascinating-marriage-of-data-science-and-biology/;

Alex Van Halen: 'There’s Nothing Left in the Music Business';"Alex Van Halen listed his requirements for a good live performance, and argued that dramatic changes in the music industry have shifted the focus back to artists' on-stage product. In a newly-published interview with Modern Drummer, which took place before the death of Eddie Van Halen, Alex said he’d always regarded Van Halen as a live band. “After we honed our skills, you learn the connection between the people and the music,” he explained. “Playing live, there should be no dead space. Never turn your back on the audience and never insult them. They are equal to you. That line that separates the audience from the stage, that’s not a line. That’s just to keep them from puking on your shit! You’re there to make the audience feel good.” He went on to claim that modern technology had been misused to destroy the world of recording. “There’s nothing left in the music business,” he said. “It’s a bunch of ones and zeroes. In the old days you’d get a dollar a record, and now you get 50 cents for 275,000 streams. It’s insane. It’s wrong. Now the only thing you have is playing live, which is ironic, because that’s how it all started.” Alex pointed out that, up until their 1984 era, Van Halen and their tour crew had all traveled on the same bus, and the experience had strengthened their onstage presence. “Leonardo da Vinci said, ‘Large rooms distract the mind; small rooms focus the mind’,” he quoted. “When you’re all tight in close quarters, it focuses your energies and you learn how to deal with issues and problems. If you’re in a large space, you never even have to say ‘hello’ to the other guys. What’s that all about?"" “I’d rather have someone wake up in the morning and say, ‘Hey, fuck you!’ as opposed to not saying anything at all,"" Alex continued. ""I’m serious. Give me some emotion! That’s what this is about. Music is a celebration of being human. With the drums at the forefront!”";https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alex-van-halen-music-business/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&utm_term=UCR;

Motor Museum, Liverpool;"Motor Museum’s unusual design provides a number of separate recording spaces inside a single gigantic warehouse. Step inside Motor Museum studios, which has played a vital role in the careers of several of the most influential UK bands of the past decades. From a musical perspective, Liverpool is perhaps best known as the birthplace of a four-piece group who enjoyed modest success in the ’60s. But the city has a lot more to offer. It has been home to a lively music scene for more than 50 years — and where there is music, there are recording studios. One Liverpool studio has been catering both to the local scene and visitors from abroad for three decades, and has been justifiably called “the most iconic studio in the North”. Following almost 30 years of constant operation at their current premises, and a history that goes back even further, this venture has played a defining role in the careers of some of the most influential British groups of the past decades. The Motor Museum combines an excellent technical setup, a dedicated staff and a truly unique workspace which, probably, looks like no other recording studio in the world. The control room is based around a 32-input Neve 8232 console. Originally conceived as a public transport repair depot, the building became home to the Lark Lane Motor Museum in the late ’70s. The collection of vintage cars and motorcycles on display apparently included the first Ferrari that was ever imported to the UK. It is located in the Lark Lane district in the South of Liverpool, which now carries a bohemian reputation as a nightlife hotspot. At the time, however, as studio founder Hambi Haralambous recalls, the museum was located too far away from the city centre to get enough visitors, and eventually had to close. Haralambous was a member of acts such as Tontrix and Hambi & The Dance in the early ’80s, and also part of a vital scene which included bands like Dead Or Alive and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. His first recording operation, The Pink Studio, started out in the basement of a Victorian villa in another part of Liverpool. The space was first used as Tontrix’s private rehearsal room, but after the band split up, it evolved into one of the first professional recording facilities in the city. After a brief stint in Italy, Haralambous was forced to leave the old premises in 1987, but the members of Echo & The Bunnymen — all motorcycle fanatics — pointed him towards the closing Lark Lane Motor Museum. After a year of planning and construction, the studio re-opened as The Pink Museum in 1988. The Phil Newell-designed stone room was conceived for drum recordings, amongst other uses, and inspired by London's Townhouse. The actual studio space is formed by a number of cabin-like rooms (see mian photo, above) arranged within the vast 240-square-metre warehouse area. Construction was overseen by Phil Newell, who was also responsible for Virgin Manor and Townhouse: hence the latter’s notorious stone room, responsible for so many ’80s gated drum sounds, was replicated at The Pink Museum. The main live room was remodelled in 2008 for a livelier, more ambient sound. The British reggae band Aswad were among the first customers at the studio, as well as members of Liverpool FC, who recorded the hit single ‘Anfield Rap’. In 1989 Andy McCluskey entered the studio for a three-day session which went so well that Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark recorded their 1991 album Sugar Tax at the Pink Museum, spawning hit singles such as ‘Sailing On The Seven Seas’ and ‘Pandora’s Box’. Around 2000, when Haralambous decided to leave the music business in order to pursue a career as a film-maker, McCluskey bought the property and continued the studio’s operations. The torch was handed over to Mike Crossey in 2009, shortly after the original carpeted main live room was remodelled for a livelier, more ambient sound. Since 2012, the studio has been operated by producer Al Groves, who recalls: “One night we were out drinking in Liverpool, and my friend Mike Crossey told me that he was thinking of moving to London, and that the Motor Museum would be available. We spent a few weeks going over numbers before I sadly had to admit I didn’t think I could make the jump to take it over. Luckily, Mike had decided to stay for the foreseeable future, so the conversation ended. Six months later, I had a text from Mike telling me that he was due to leave at the end of the week, and had told Andy that I would be taking over! Immediately afterwards another text came from Andy McCluskey, and it was either take the big leap of faith, or regret it for a long time. I am really grateful to both Mike and Andy for giving me a little nudge to take it!“ Today, the Motor Museum is centered around a Neve 8232 console with 32 channels, augmented by an outboard collection that includes pairs of Empirical Labs Distressors, ‘silverface’ UREI 1176LN and Cartec Program Equalisers. An Avalon VT-737sp channel strip, a Retro Instruments Sta-Level and preamps by AMS Neve and API complete the picture. The microphone collection has been built around classics like the solid-state Neumanns U87 and TLM170 as well as numerous AKG C414s, yet it also includes more specialised mics such as a Manley Reference Valve Microphone, and ribbons like the AEA R44 and R88 Mk2, as well as a pair of Coles 4038s. The outboard selection features high-quality EQ, dynamics, preamps and effects. One of the studio’s strengths is an instrument and backline selection that includes a wide choice of Fender, Marshall and Ampeg amplifiers along with keyboard instruments such as a Rhodes piano, Minimoog Model D and Octave Cat synths. Al Groves’ favourite, though, is a vintage 1960s Ludwig drum kit: “It always sounds great!” The Octave Cat synthesizer.The instrument collection includes the classic Minimoog. Motor Museum has played a vital role in the careers of several of the most influential UK bands of the past decades. Oasis recorded their first single ‘Supersonic’ here, and Arctic Monkeys used Motor Museum for some of their earliest recordings. Other seminal acts from this era include the La’s, the 1975 and the Coral. More recently Ben Howard, Jake Bugg, Tom Odell and Tribes have worked at the studio, and current clients include Bring Me The Horizon, Cast and Bellevue Days. These days, Al Groves is seeing a trend towards more specialised, producer-led studios. He concludes: “Being outside of London means I can have a world class studio but at a real-life cost, and a lot of the artists I work with love being able to come away to Liverpool to record. For them it’s like a working holiday!“  TO

8 Ways to Prevent Sabotaging Your Own Music Career;"Stepping out with the decision to become an independent artist or music creator is pretty bold, considering the various challenges that the business entails. From building a fan base, to making your own songs, to at least managing to get a song heard by a large (enough) audience, the struggle is constant, especially in the early days.   However, as many have proven over the years, it is not impossible for any serious song lyricist, artist, or band to make their intended mark. How far you reach is often determined by your own mental attitude towards developing your career, and your approach to doing what it takes to get the outcomes you want. Of course, it’s not quite that simple, but once you understand that basic truth, everything else becomes clearer. Well, at least as long as you’re not getting in the way of your own development.    One of the keys to making it in the music business is to understand what needs to be done to get where you want to go. And while success is not guaranteed for anyone, there are some ingredients that are a given in order to have a real shot at it. Obviously, you need some level of talent, to begin with, but then you also need to work on creating the right image, as well as connecting with the right people and coming up with a strategy to get some exposure. You should also be prepared to invest some amount of cash in your career. Don’t think just because the internet now exists, it is cheap and easy to make your own songs and get free publicity.      You might have heard the phrase “your attitude determines your altitude.” While it might sound a tad corny, it is one of those sayings that carry a lot of truth and has been repeated by many successful people. A great mental attitude means not limiting yourself to small goals, but actually aiming for the highest possibilities. It means not thinking that you can’t afford to use high-quality music recording studios, but instead trying to figure out how to afford it. Settling for home-made recordings can seriously hurt your career.   It also means not focusing on the fact that you might not have a lot of financial resources, but instead thinking about the amount of money you can possibly make and actively doing daily activities to eventually get you there. The problem of starving artist syndrome is real and has whittled away at the careers of many talented individuals. Avoid this by continuing to think big, looking past the little things that are lacking and envisioning the goals you want to achieve.    It’s easy to get caught up with other song lyricists, bands, and musicians who are well-known and try to model your success off theirs. After all, The Chainsmokers managed to make a hit out of “#Selfie,” so it should be easy for your ‘well-structured’ club anthem to get noticed too, right? Or if Miri Ben-Ari can make it as a crossover classical musician and end up winning a Grammy, then you should break the mold too because you can play the heck out of a stringed instrument as well, right?   Well, first of all, success comes differently for everyone. Ben-Ari, for instance, has recalled in interviews that she started playing the violin at age five and, even after many years of training, was out in the wilderness for a long time after moving to New York from Israel. She has mentioned spending a lot of nights playing in numerous clubs without any recognition for years, before being finally discovered.   Hers and many more success stories often seem glamorous, almost fairytale-like when the headlines are being made. However, if you dig a little deeper, you will find that they often took a long time and much sacrifice to get where they are. So, is it a good idea for you to compare your success to other accomplished acts, who you feel you might be just as good as, or even better than talent-wise? Not unless you are willing to begin at the same spot where they began and do the same things they did. And even then, things and times have changed, so the way they did it back then might not work today.   You might be holding yourself back if you are looking at what a mainstream act is doing now and trying to mirror your own success off that, instead of taking the time to build your own buzz, as they did when they were at the same spot you are currently in.    Success rarely comes overnight in any form of business, music or otherwise. Instead, it’s a continuous process that you have to keep on repeating day in, day out until the work starts paying off. The process can be daunting at times, whether it is continuously seeking out the best song lyricists and music recording studios to collaborate with, in order to ensure your songs are of a consistently high quality, or hitting the road often in a bid to keep on meeting the right people.   Whatever it is, you have to trust ‘it’ and stay committed to the process until something gives. Bruno Mars could have ended up being a no-name after being discarded by Motown when he was just trying out his wings, but he stuck to what he knew and the rest is history.    How badly do you want to achieve your goals in music and how are you preparing to meet them? And what are those goals anyway? These are critical questions to ask yourself if you want to continue developing your craft and be in a state of readiness.   The truth is that many acts stay stuck in the quagmire of obscurity because they have either not asked themselves the important questions or aren’t prepared for opportunities that pop up from time to time. For example, you get an opportunity to pitch a song to a record label or popular artist, but your demos are not mixed properly, so even though you have some good lyrics, you end up getting turned down.   Your excuse might be that you couldn’t afford a professional music recording studio, but you could be looked at as being lackadaisical or just not ready for what you seek. After all, if you want to be taken seriously, you need to put your best foot (recording/performance/attitude) forward. Of course, being prepared doesn’t mean you will automatically kick down every door you enter; it just means you have a better chance of getting a foot in.      Even if you feel like you’re all that and a bag of chips, there will always be something else to learn that could make you better. It could be improving on your writing to make you a better song lyricist, strengthening your vocals so you have more range, or learning an instrument that improves your overall skills that come in handy if you attempt to make your own songs.   Developing your skills and building your career is mostly up to you and the decisions you make, especially if you are an independent artist. Be aware of your weak areas and keep seeking for ways to build on them. Be aware of your strengths too and keep on training them. A strong muscle will eventually become weak if it is not being used regularly.    The music business is not for the faint-hearted when one considers that there are so many artists that are not earning viable incomes from their music careers. In fact, recent reports show that almost 91 percent of current artists are listed as unrecognized. It’s little wonder that some quit after a few tries and successive failures.    If you are serious about building your career, it’s best to have a real love for it, rather than for monetary gains. If your motivation is just the money or fame that comes with being a popular artist, you are bound to get fed up and drop out if you’ve failed to achieve either after trying for some time.   Doing it for the love doesn’t guarantee success. However, it keeps you going and sets you up for the possibility of success down the road. Plus, being in the category of unrecognized is not necessarily a bad thing. Many of today’s chart-toppers were in that same position for many years before getting their big break. The question is, how long do you plan to stay there and what are your plans to find success; whatever that means to you?    Getting to know the right people in the music business is an important part of growing in it. Connecting with other artists and industry professionals will at least keep you in their minds so that when a need arises, it’s possible that you could be called upon to fill it.   The music business is one that is built on relationships and some of the most successful artists have been those who were able to continuously make the right ones. You also need to connect with regular people in order to build your fan base, so make use of social networking channels where you can both share your music and interact with listeners.   As you seek to develop your artistry, it is important to spend some time focusing on what your goals are. Take the necessary steps to connect with the right people, as well as continuing to make songs of quality through suitable pro studios and services.  While the industry keeps changing, the formula for success remains pretty much the same. Keep out of your own way and you never know where the right mindset and work ethic could take you.

Few could argue against the fact that when Merck Mercuriadis floated Hipgnosis Songs Fund on the London Stock Exchange in summer 2018, it changed the face of the music business. That IPO saw Mercuriadis raise over £200m (approx $265m) via share issues before Hipgnosis started trading on the LSE. That money set Mercuriadis and Hipgnosis on their way to becoming the most frequently acquisitive company in the modern industry. Although Hipgnosis’s blistering growth since then has recently attracted one or two skeptics in the financial world, its early investors will be happy bunnies: Since that flotation in June 2018, the company’s share price (to January 15, 2021) has increased by over 16%… despite the small matter of a global pandemic. Now, Music Business Worldwide can reveal that another music industry figure is plotting a major flotation of a new rights company. It’s happening in the US, and is borrowing a few of the hallmarks of Hipgnosis’s story. Neil Jacobson was the long-time President of Geffen Records in Los Angeles, before exiting the UMG label in 2019 and establishing his own songwriter/producer management firm. That firm, now known as Hallwood Media, has been at the forefront of some notable rights acquisitions stories over the past two years. One such story saw Hallwood client Jeff Bhasker – producer to Kanye West and others – sell his producer points and his music catalog. (Bhasker’s producer royalties and the writer’s share of his publishing catalog went to Hipgnosis in 2019; Jacobson recently confirmed to Rolling Stone that he also struck an earlier deal that saw Morgan Stanley acquire a basket of Bhasker’s rights for a rumored $60-plus million.) MBW has now obtained a SPAC S-1 prospectus for Jacobson’s new company – The Music Acquisition Corporation – which explains how the exec is planning to raise $200 million (potentially up to $230 million, depending on demand) via an imminent IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. In the US, a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) is an entity formed to raise capital via an IPO which plans to use the proceeds to buy unspecified businesses/assets after the flotation. In other words, if Jacobson pulls it off, it will net him and his team a nine-figure sum to go shopping… and they want to go shopping in the music business. Book-runners for the prospective IPO have been named as Citigroup and Cantor Fitzgerald. What’s The Music Acquisition Corporation going to spend this loot on? Music copyrights? Almost definitely – but this isn’t just a Hipgnosis copycat. The S-1 filing explains that the firm has highlighted four separate schools of acquisition target, with all of sitting betwixt the crossroads of music and tech. The prospectus – which you can read in full through here – breaks these target areas down as follows: With Jacobson as CEO and Chairman of The Music Acquisition Corporation, the SPAC’s leadership also includes ex-Lehman Brothers and Barclays Capital veteran Todd Lowen as COO. In addition to Jacobson and Lowen, The Music Acquisition Corporation’s Directors are named as Michael Levitt, Ben Silverman and Tunde Balogun. Levitt has been the Chief Executive Officer of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors since July 2016. Silverman is an entrepreneur and movie/TV producer who has served as the Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Propagate Content since 2016. Balogun will be best known in music industry circles. He is President and co-founder of LVRN, the US-based record label, music publishing, and artist management company whose signings include artists such as 6lack, Summer Walker, and Dram. The Music Acquisition Corporation prospectus reads: “The music industry is highly fragmented with hundreds of content owners and creators, publishing and distribution platforms and other companies providing enabling technologies and services to other industry participants and consumers, many of which are privately owned. We believe that the experience and capabilities of our management team will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination, and bring value to the target post-business combination. “We believe that our management team’s extensive experience acquiring, operating and growing businesses in the music sector, coupled with their vast network of leading industry executives, entrepreneurs, investors and deal makers, will provide access to attractive business combination opportunities and position us to succeed in consummating an initial business combination.” It reveals that the company intends to float on the NYSE under the ticker TMAC.U. “We expect that our units will be listed on the NYSE on or promptly after the date of this prospectus,” it reads. The prospectus is dated January 15, 2021. Cinq Music Group’s repertoire has won Grammy awards, dozens of Gold and Platinum RIAA certifications, and numerous No.1 chart positions on a variety of Billboard charts. Its repertoire includes heavyweights such as Bad Bunny, Janet Jackson, Daddy Yankee, T.I., Sean Kingston, Anuel, and hundreds more.Music Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.

Negusei noted that during her investment tour, she seeks to have a clear understanding of the several opportunities that Uganda offers in the identified sectors. She added that: “We definitely wanted to bring entertainment in Africa, we are looking for a hub, a home to be the Africa Hollywood; America became America not because of Agriculture but because of entertainment industry. If we bring entertainment whether movie, music award, every year, Uganda can become the home of the entertainment industry.” “It’s our job to bring the African movies, music, take it to the next level by recognizing ourself, we don’t have to wait for other cultures to recognize us, we are good enough to recognize ourselves,” Nagusei said. She revealed that for the start, she has earmarked USD12m as the investment package for a period of five years. Negusei who is arrived ahead of Akon’s visit to the country will be visiting different government departments, agencies and the private sector. She came along with a group of Turkish investors from LCB Worldwide a multinational company who invests in host countries points of entry to conduct Prevention Solutions to combat pathogens which could lead to pandemics.

Alex Van Halen: 'There’s Nothing Left in the Music Business';"Alex Van Halen listed his requirements for a good live performance, and argued that dramatic changes in the music industry have shifted the focus back to artists' on-stage product. In a newly-published interview with Modern Drummer, which took place before the death of Eddie Van Halen, Alex said he’d always regarded Van Halen as a live band. “After we honed our skills, you learn the connection between the people and the music,” he explained. “Playing live, there should be no dead space. Never turn your back on the audience and never insult them. They are equal to you. That line that separates the audience from the stage, that’s not a line. That’s just to keep them from puking on your shit! You’re there to make the audience feel good.” He went on to claim that modern technology had been misused to destroy the world of recording. “There’s nothing left in the music business,” he said. “It’s a bunch of ones and zeroes. In the old days you’d get a dollar a record, and now you get 50 cents for 275,000 streams. It’s insane. It’s wrong. Now the only thing you have is playing live, which is ironic, because that’s how it all started.” Alex pointed out that, up until their 1984 era, Van Halen and their tour crew had all traveled on the same bus, and the experience had strengthened their onstage presence. “Leonardo da Vinci said, ‘Large rooms distract the mind; small rooms focus the mind’,” he quoted. “When you’re all tight in close quarters, it focuses your energies and you learn how to deal with issues and problems. If you’re in a large space, you never even have to say ‘hello’ to the other guys. What’s that all about?"" “I’d rather have someone wake up in the morning and say, ‘Hey, fuck you!’ as opposed to not saying anything at all,"" Alex continued. ""I’m serious. Give me some emotion! That’s what this is about. Music is a celebration of being human. With the drums at the forefront!”";https://ift.tt/3pLbUhK;

 Music Bussiness (A&R, Sync, Brand Partnerships) 74,078 followers 🟥 Los Prismas de la Creatividad

La Creatividad es un concepto mayúsculo, integrador de nuestra vida sin importar la profesión a la que nos debamos.
Se manifiesta, con más o menos agilidad, en múltiples estados, versiones, situaciones, o necesidades. Y cuando aparece el éxito, detrás siempre está ella. 

En este contexto nos preguntamos: ¿No sería más estimulante para nuestra mente, posiblemente pecada de rutina y falso confort, acercarnos con humildad a nuevos contextos y aprender de ellos con una mirada rejuvenecida? 

Así nacen Los Prismas de la Creatividad.
Un programa streaming que pretende ofrecer una conversación inspiradora con profesionales de máxima referencia en otras industrias para conocer de primera mano cómo entienden la creatividad, cómo ponen en práctica el proceso creativo, cuál es su metodología de inspiración o de qué manera gestionan la frustración y la presión de su trabajo.

Para convivir con la incertidumbre que supone el baile entre el conocimiento y la exigente renovación de los procesos aprendidos, será imprescindible acercarnos a la Creatividad sin cátedras ni dogmas. Y aunque en nuestro devenir la hayamos utilizado como apellido en las tarjetas de visita, no podemos suponernos propietarios de lo que no somos.
En Los Prismas de la Creatividad contaremos con invitados de la música, la cocina, el deporte, la medicina o la arquitectura. Será un un programa streaming semanal, dirigido por Javier Guadiana, todos los lunes a las 17:30 en el perfil de LinkedIn de Reason Why.

Frank Zappa Explains the Decline of the Music Business (1987) |  Open Culture Frank Zappa Explains the Decline of the Music Business (1987);"in Music |   	September 13th, 2016  1 Comment 


  
  “Remember the 60s?” says Frank Zappa in the interview above, “that era that a lot of people have these glorious memories of?… they really weren’t that great, those years.” Ever the grumpy uncle. But Zappa does get nostalgic for one thing, and it’s an unexpected one: the music business. “One thing that did happen in the 60s,” he says, “was some music of an unusual and experimental nature did get recorded, did get released.” The executives of the day were “cigar-chomping old guys who looked at the product and said, ‘I don’t know. Who knows what it is? Record it, stick it out. If it sells, alright!’” “We were better off with those guys,” says Zappa, “than we are with the hip, young executives,” making decisions about what people should hear. The hippies are more conservative than the conservative “old guys” ever were. This Zappa of 1987 recommends getting back to the “who knows?” approach, “that entrepreneurial spirit” of the grand old industry barons of the 60s. One can almost imagine Zappa—in the 60s—pining for the days of Edison, who refused to give up on the wax cylinder but would also record virtually anything. If both the time of Edison and the time of Zappa were bonanzas for makers of novelty records, so much the better. Zappa was novel.  
  Still it seems like a funny sentiment coming from a guy who built most of his career in opposition to the record industry. But it was in the period of alleged decay that Zappa broke with Warner Bros. and founded his own label in 1977, making a deal with Phonogram to distribute his releases in the U.S. When Phonogram refused to release his 1981 single “I Don’t Wanna Get Drafted,” Zappa created another label, Barking Pumpkin Records, making sure he got to make and sell the music he wanted to. In many ways people like Zappa—or later Kate Bush or Prince—anticipated our current music industry, in which we have artists starting labels left and right, controlling their own production and output. But those artists are mostly a tiny handful of hugely successful stars with mogul-sized ambitions. Does this help or harm the music economy as a whole? Independent musicians very rarely get the smallest window on how things work at the level of Beyonce, Jay-Z, or Taylor Swift (who “is the industry,” Bloomberg once breathlessly proclaimed). But as Zappa notes, “the person in the executive chair may not be the final arbiter of taste for the entire population.” Even if those executives are themselves artists, we may greatly benefit from a wider range of “unusual and experimental” sounds in popular culture. Zappa suggests the way to do that is to get the “cigar-chomping old guys” (and they were all guys) back in charge. The rest of Zappa’s interview concerns the bogeyman of 80s and 90s music, the PMRC, and his very strong feelings about censorship, social control, and sex. It’s classic Zappa and won’t raise any eyebrows now, but it is interesting to hear his take on the decline of the music business since the 60s. We use different criteria to measure the apex of the industry—often depending on whether the labels or the artists made more money. Whichever period we lionize, for whatever reason, within a hundred-year window a tiny handful of musicians and record executives made enormous, dynasty-making fortunes. It just so happens that these days it’s an even tinier handful of musicians and executives at the top, making even huger fortunes. And there’s a lot more synergy between them.

We thank you!    “Zappa was novel” Indeed, but certainly not a “novelty”, although he was sadly relegated to that niche in which acts like Weird Al thrive. Zappa was much more than merely the “grumpy uncle”. He was cynical for a very good reason. He saw the future, and knew the future would suck. A prime example is in the post dated just after this one, the Marvel Universe/”temp music” fiasco.  Music now, like everything else in the entertainment industry, is designed solely to keep the masses dumb and docile.  A dystopian future is upon us-pass me the Soma! Name (required)

Ray Davies’ one-man Kinks show is a whinge, but Lola remains a transgressive anthem for the ages;"Monologue The Moneygoround, which revisits the band’s 1970 comeback album, shows that Davies should stick to writing songs, not plays
 There were rumours that The Kinks were set to reunite for Glastonbury this year. Sadly, social distancing has put an end to that, just when the battling Davies brothers, singer-songwriter Ray and lead guitarist Dave, seem to have bridged their own lifelong social distance issues. Mind you, a cancelled reunion might be a suitably poetic conclusion to a band who have always done things the hard way. Back in 1970, when their original beat group run of smash hits was behind them, The Kinks were already viewed as a spent force, with Ray Davies on the verge of bankruptcy and a nervous breakdown. Desperate for a hit, they miraculously struck gold with one of most transgressive pop songs of all time, the glorious Lola, about a confused young man’s love affair with a transexual. That is the basis for one-man show The Moneygoround, a theatrical monologue written by Ray Davies and playwright Paul Sirett, and performed by actor Ben Norris, with songs from The Kinks’ 1970 comeback concept album Lola Versus the Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One. You can see why they shortened the title. The usual legal disclaimer appears at the beginning of the YouTube livestream to insist that “any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental,” which is possibly the only element of outright fiction in the whole thing. Davies has described it as a “psychodrama” – a fancy word for a solipsistic whinge about how hard it is to be Ray Davies. Which, to be fair, is his usual subject matter. Norris has the unenviable task of delivering a non-stop stream of complaints about the pressures of being a creative artist, breadwinner and family man whilst battling an uncaring industry who only want to exploit his talent for their own enrichment. He describes the music business as “a rat-infested sewer filled with con artists, thieves and addicts,” so I guess not much has changed in five decades. Modern audiences might have more sympathy if the stressed-out rock star did not sound equally upset at being “surrounded by screaming babies, dirty nappies, half-eaten jars of Heinz baby food.” Life, in other words. The chief problem with considering The Moneygoround as a new piece of work is how dated it all appears, from the audio-visual edits to the language of the character (“I just needed to get my head together”). Davies has been an extraordinary innovator in terms of expanding pop’s narrative possibilities, but this is a multimedia event as conceived by someone whose ideas of media predate the internet. Frankly, it could have worked just as well as a radio broadcast, ideally featuring the grumbling voice of Davies himself, albeit Norris does a good job with unsympathetic material (Radio 4 listeners may recognise his voice as Ben, youngest son in the Archers). What has not dated are the songs that empower it. Lola is an anthem tackling a notoriously thorny area of gender politics that was composed with such wit, insight and empathy it remains beyond criticism in this most prickly and oversensitive of eras. It is a woke anthem from before woke even existed. As a songwriter, Davies is a genius. As a playwright, well, the sooner he can get back to writing new songs for the Kinks, the better.

Jesse Ed Davis - Wikipedia;"Jesse Edwin Davis (September 21, 1944 – June 22, 1988) was a Native American guitarist. He was well regarded as a session artist and solo performer, was a member of Taj Mahal's backing band and played with musicians such as Eric Clapton, John Lennon, and George Harrison.[1] In 2018, Davis was posthumously inducted into the  Native American Music Hall of Fame[2] at the 18th Annual Native American Music Awards.
 Davis was born in Norman, Oklahoma. He was the son of Jesse Edwin (Bus) Davis II, whose ancestry was a blend of Comanche, Seminole, and Muscogee (Creek), and Vivian Mae (Bea) Saunkeah, a Kiowa.[3][4][5][6] His father was an accomplished painter in the Flatstyle Southern Plains painting; his works were exhibited in the state capitol in Oklahoma City.[7][better source needed] Davis began his musical career in the late 1950s in Oklahoma City and surrounding cities with John Ware (later a drummer for Emmylou Harris, and Michael Nesmith during the First National Band era), John Selk (later a bass player for Donovan), Jerry Fisher (later a vocalist with Blood, Sweat & Tears), Mike Boyle, Chris Frederickson, drummer Bill Maxwell (later with Andrae Crouch and Koinonia) and others.[citation needed] He graduated from Northeast High School in 1962.[4] Davis graduated with a degree in English literature from the University of Oklahoma; even into his later years, he was remembered to enjoy quoting Socrates and Plato.[8]  By the mid-1960s, he had quit school and went touring with Conway Twitty.[9] Davis eventually moved to California. For eight years, he lived in Marina del Rey with his companion, Patti Daley, and her son, Billy. Through his friendship with Levon Helm, he became friends with Leon Russell, who introduced him to recording session work.[10] Davis joined Taj Mahal and played guitar and piano on Mahal's first four albums. He played slide, lead and rhythm, country and even jazz during his three-year stint with Mahal. Mahal and his band were invited to England by the Rolling Stones,[11] and they appeared as a musical guest in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus.[12] He played in the ""electric"" disc of Mahal's double album Giant Step/De Ole Folks at Home (1969) and appeared in two songs of his fourth album Happy Just to Be Like I Am (1971).[13] In 1970, he played on and produced Roger Tillison's only album for Atco Records, a division of Atlantic. Davis and Tillison − both Oklahoman − were joined at the Record Plant by Bobby Bruce (fiddle), Larry Knechtel (organ and harmonica), Stan Szelest (piano); Billy Rich (bass); Jim Keltner (drums) and Sandy Konikoff (percussion); Don Preston and Joey Cooper were vocal accompanists.[14] Roger Tillison's Album was recorded live. It was finally released on CD by Wounded Bird Records in 2008, with Davis playing electric guitar, bottleneck (slide) guitar and banjo.[15] The Woody Guthrie song ""Old Cracked Looking Glass"" has become a standard for Oklahoma bands.[citation needed] In 1971, Davis recorded his first solo album after Atco Records signed a contract with him to record two albums with the label. The first was the album ¡Jesse Davis! (1971), which featured backing vocals by Gram Parsons and performances by Leon Russell and Eric Clapton, among others.[16] Davis was close friends with Gene Clark. In 1971, he played on and produced Clark's second solo album, White Light, and provided lead guitar on Clark's album No Other in 1974. On Jackson Browne's 1972 debut album, Davis played the electric guitar solo on Browne's hit song ""Doctor, My Eyes"".[13] After guesting with Russell on Bob Dylan's 1971 single ""Watching the River Flow"", and collaborating in Albert King’s Lovejoy, Davis went on to work with George Harrison, performing at the ex-Beatle's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden, along with Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Russell, Keltner, Clapton and others.[17] Two more solo albums followed: in 1972 Ululu, which included the original release of Harrison's ""Sue Me, Sue You Blues"",[18][19] and in 1973 Keep Me Comin, occasionally listed as Keep On Coming. Around this time, Davis began playing with John Lennon, for whom he played lead guitar on the albums Walls and Bridges (1974) and Rock 'n' Roll (1975).[9] In addition, Davis was a guest performer on other albums by former Beatles:  Harrison's Extra Texture (1975)[20] and Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974) and Ringo's Rotogravure (1976).[13] In the late summer and fall of 1975, he performed with the Faces as second guitarist throughout their final US tour. It was on this tour that Davis became addicted to drugs.[11] After the Faces tour, Davis continued to work as a session player. In addition to the artists listed above, Davis contributed to albums by Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Keith Moon, Steve Miller, Guthrie Thomas, Harry Nilsson, Ry Cooder, David Cassidy, Willie Nelson, Neil Diamond, Rick Danko, Van Dyke Parks and others. He played on Leonard Cohen's Death of a Ladies' Man (1977), produced by Phil Spector.[13] In 1977, Davis moved to Hawaii. In 1981, he returned to Los Angeles broke and ravaged by drug and alcohol addiction.[8] In and out of clinics, Davis disappeared from the music industry for a time, spending much of the 1980s dealing with alcohol and drug addiction.[13] In 1985 he formed and played in the Graffiti Band, which coupled his music with the poetry of the Native American activist John Trudell (American Indian Movement). The result of this collaboration was the album, released initially only on cassette, called ""AKA Grafitti Man"", which Bob Dylan called the best album of the year.[11][21] In the spring of 1987, the Graffiti Band performed with Taj Mahal at the Palomino Club in North Hollywood, California. At this show, George Harrison, Bob Dylan and John Fogerty got up from the audience to join Davis and Mahal in an unrehearsed set which included Fogerty's ""Proud Mary"" and Dylan's ""Watching the River Flow"", as well as classics such as ""Blue Suede Shoes"", ""Peggy Sue"", ""Honey Don't"", ""Matchbox"" and ""Gone, Gone, Gone"".[22] Davis had a relationship with Patti Daley for about ten years. Then he married twice, first to Tantalayo Saenz and then Kelly Brady.[4] In his last years, he served as drug and alcohol counselor at the American Indian Free Clinic in Long Beach.[8] Davis collapsed in the laundry room of an apartment building and was pronounced dead in Venice, California, on June 22, 1988. Police stated his death appeared to be the result of a drug overdose. Davis had a fresh needle mark on one arm and burned matches and tin foil were scattered on the ground nearby.[23] He was 43 years old.
 In 2002, he was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame.[24] In 2018, Jesse Ed Davis was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual Native American Music Awards. A performance tribute was held by his former Graffiti band members, Mark Shark and Quiltman.[25] His cousins Richenda Davis Bates and Constance Davis Carter accepted the induction.[26][6]";https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Ed_Davis;
Music app co-founded by multi-platinum US producer and ex-Universal exec will pay users up to $1,000 for identifying potential hits - Music Business Worldwide;Music startup Djooky, an emerging artist platform, has launched a new feature on its app called HitHunter that promises to pay its users cash prizes for identifying potential hits. The new A&R feature follows the inception of the Djooky Music Awards in July 2020. Described as “the world’s first global online music contest”, the competition is open to all artists and songwriters worldwide and will run four times a year. Users can take part in the voting process for the awards via the Djooky app, with the winning artist receiving $10,000 in cash and a recording session at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.  Co-founded by multi-platinum US producer Brian Malouf, who has worked with the likes of Madonna and Michael Jackson, and ex-Universal Ukraine executive and record producer Andrew Dakhovsky, (CEO), Djooky operates from Los Angeles, Berlin, London and Kyiv in Ukraine. The Djooky team also includes Grammy-nominated artist and music director Patrice Rushen, UK-based Ivor Novello winning songwriter Sacha Skarbek and producer/music executive and songwriter Justin Gray (whose credits include Mariah Carey, John Legend and Avril Lavigne).  The HitHunter feature works by letting the app’s users back songs they believe will grow to be popular on the platform. Djooky plans to run weekly and seasonal leaderboards for HitHunter via its app, with each user being granted 100 ‘Hit Points (HPs)’ within the app, which reset every week.  The more ‘HPs’ a user allocates to a given song, the higher they will rank if the track proves to be a hit amongst other users in the Djooky Music Awards. Djooky states that cash prizes of $100, $75, $50, $25 and $10 will be awarded to successful users who can identify “the next potential big hit” on a weekly basis. A grand prize of $1000 will be paid to the world’s “ultimate HitHunter” in the final global round of the competition, with $500, $250, $100 and $50 being presented to users finishing second, third, fourth and fifth. “It extends the principle of music recommendation by involving our community in the curation process.” Andrew Dakhovsky Djooky co-founder Andrew Dakhovsky said: “These are incredibly difficult times for artists, and we are proud to be presenting the HitHunter function in our app to help new talent engage with new audiences. “It extends the principle of music recommendation by involving our community in the curation process.” “Now HitHunter gives the non-musicians in our community a fun and unique opportunity to showcase their talent-spotting prowess and more importantly become recognised for it in the form of leaderboards and prizes.” Brian Malouf, Djooky  Djooky co-founder/multi-platinum US producer, Brian Malouf, added: “We always envisioned that this competition would go beyond the songwriting aspect of the contest for our creative community, especially given that the fans play such a huge part in their success through the voting functionality. “Now HitHunter gives the non-musicians in our community a fun and unique opportunity to showcase their talent-spotting prowess and more importantly become recognised for it in the form of leaderboards and prizes.”  Music Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.

Taxing time for Ed Sheeran as singer pays £28m to HMRC;"By: 				

						Hannah Godfrey					
 Singer Ed Sheeran paid a whopping £28m in taxes this year, making him one of the UK’s biggest taxpayers. Ed Sheeran was named along with 49 others as part of the Sunday Times Tax List, which lists the taxes paid by the wealthiest in the country. Sheeran was by far the most high-profile new entry onto the tax list. His 2020 wealth stood at £200m. Other high-profile names on the Sunday Times Tax List included Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who paid £34.8m to the taxman. Her wealth in 2020 stood at £795m. Rowling’s tax liabilities have fallen by just under £14m in the past year from £48.6m to £34.8m. With theatres and theme parks closed, her earnings are down from an estimated £100m to £72.5m, resulting in a smaller tax exposure. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic decline in the taxes paid by the wealthiest people in the country, according to the latest Sunday Times Tax list. The extent of the tax liabilities needed to make the UK top 50 taxpayers list fell from £20.4m last year to £13.1 this year – a fall of more than a third (36%) in the past 12 months. Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley has paid £46m to HMRC this year, placing him 12th on the list. His wealth last year stood at nearly £2bn. Among those no longer featuring in the tax list is Sir Philip Green, who has seen his main business, Arcadia, fall into administration in the past year. He and his wife Lady Tina Green ranked 23rd in last year’s tax list with a tax liability of £44.4m. Meanwhile the Duke of Westminster paid £41.2m to the taxman, bringing him in 15th on the list with wealth of more than £10bn.

Country star Kris Kristofferson quietly bows out;"COUNTRY STAR. Kris Kristofferson performs on stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2017.  					 
						File photo by Dylan Martinez/Reuters					 Country singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson has quietly retired from touring after more than 50 years in the music business. The news, buried in a news release earlier this week, comes a year after the “Me and Bobby McGee” singer played his last gig on the Outlaw Country Cruise in the Caribbean in January 2020. As the coronavirus pandemic shuttered live music venues last year, Kristofferson’s decision not to return to the road felt natural, his longtime manager Tamara Saviano told Variety on Thursday, January 28. “It was just sort of a slow changing of the guard thing,” Saviano said. “To us on this side of the fence it was an organic, normal, ‘things are changing’ thing. Kris is aging; Kris is 84. It didn’t feel like such big news to us.” The announcement came in a news release that said a new management company would represent Kristofferson’s business affairs, alongside his son John, after Kristofferson “offically retired in 2020.” Kristofferson rose to fame in the 1970s in Nashville and wrote classics including “Help Me Make it Through the Night” and “For the Good Times.” He was also a sought-after actor, winning a Golden Globe for his lead role in the 1976 version of A Star is Born opposite Barbra Streisand. Kristofferson began experiencing debilitating memory loss in his mid-70s which his wife in 2016 said had been diagnosed as a result of Lyme’s Disease, and which had much improved. – Rappler.com JOIN OUR NEWSLETTER Fearless reporting delivered to you follow us";https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/country-star-kris-kristofferson-quietly-bows-out?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1611999705;
Frontaal / The Bruery - I've got friends in the music Business B.A. Blend 2 (Bourbon, Armagnac und Calvados) - HoppiThek GbR Biertasting Bitburg;HoppiThek GbR HoppiThek GbR Die schwere Kaffee-Gebäck-Praline Der zweite Musik-Business Collab-Brew zwischen Frontaal und The Bruery, ist ein Blend eines Imperial Mexican Stouts, welches in Bourbon, Armagnac und Calvados Fässern gelagert wurde. Mit 14%  Alkohol und 54 Bittereinheiten ist es ein stolzer Vertreter seiner Zunft. Mit Warrior gehopft und 6 Malzsorten, sowie gerösteten Weizen hat es auch einen schönen Rohstoffhintergrund. Tiefschwarz und mit einer Schaumkrone, die etwas an ein nebliges Abendrot erinnert, bedeckt gluckert das Bier ins Glas. Die Viskosität ist sichtlich dickflüssig. In die Nase strömen mit Likör gefüllte Bitterschokoladen-Pralinen, dazu das Kaffeeplätzchen und eine gute, heiße Tasse Kaffee. Im Antrunk entwickelt sich das vorher im Geruch wahrgenommene weiter und man hat hier ein klebrig, dickes Bier auf der Zunge, welches zuckrig, fast gebäckartig stehen bleibt. Allmählich entwickelt sich hinten heraus eine gewisse aufkommende Schärfe, die aber durch die Kohlensäure um die Zunge herum schön eingebunden ist. Das Bier ist dick, cremig, schokoladig, kaffeelastig und bitter-scharf. Also alle Eindrücke, die ein gutes Imperial Mexican Stout mitbringen muss. Dann diese Veredelung durch die einzelnen Fässer, die dem Gaumen hinten heraus noch Kirschen und dunkle Beeren schenkt. Fazit: Schwer, komplex, dick und bitter. Aber trotzdem eine wunderbare Kaffee-Praline. Die 14% Alkohol sind natürlich nicht ganz wegrationalisierbar, aber bei diesem vollen Mundgefühl im Bier, trotzdem gut aufgehoben. 8,5 HoppiPoints  Facts: Alc. 14% Bittereinheiten 54IBUs Farbe 78EBC Food-Pairing: Truthahn-Braten mit Kartoffeln und Rosenkohl, Wildgans, Wurzelgemüse und schokoladiger Nachtisch Glas-Empfehlung: Spiegelau Stout Glas Das Bier hier kaufen Du musst angemeldet sein, um einen Kommentar abzugeben.

Music Business Association Partners With Scars Foundation and Music Health Alliance to Establish Mental Health Fund - Music Business Association;"Newly formed fund will help provide struggling Association members with essential mental health services January 28, 2021 — The Music Business Association (Music Biz) today announces the formation of the Music Business Mental Health Fund, established in partnership with Music Health Alliance (MHA) and the Scars Foundation. The fund was created to help Association members impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic gain access to important mental health services, including screenings and therapy sessions. “The increased stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have shed more light on something we’ve already come to know: access to mental health services is essential in sustaining our professional success and, more importantly, our individual well-being,” said Music Biz President Portia Sabin. “Our industry has only weathered the lasting effects of this pandemic through collaboration; as such, Music Biz is thrilled to partner with Music Health Alliance and the Scars Foundation to offer these vital services to those in our member community who need them.” The Music Business Mental Health Fund is open to qualified employees of Music Biz member companies, individual professional members, and people who were furloughed or laid off from a Music Biz member company in 2020. Nashville-based non-profit Music Health Alliance, which provides free healthcare advocacy and support to the nationwide music community, will administer the fund with 100% confidentiality, overseeing applications for assistance and disbursement of funds. For more information on the fund, a full list of qualifications, and access to the application, visit MusicHealthAlliance.com. “I have been a member of Music Biz for five years now, and honestly I have never met a group of people more willing and dedicated to helping others in our industry,” said Scars Foundation Executive Director Naomi Fabricant. “There is such a like-minded energy of ‘anything we can do to help is what we are here for,’ and as someone who has been in the music business for many years, I appreciate that more than words can say. Because of this, the SCARS Foundation thought that Music Biz and MHA would be the right partner to help us deliver mental health services to our community.” “Our daily interaction with music industry professionals through the COVID-19 pandemic has graphically exposed the need for access to mental health services,” said Tatum Allsep, founder and CEO of Music Health Alliance. “Thanks to the foresight of Godsmack’s SCARS Foundation and the Music Biz Association, Music Health Alliance can provide immediate navigation and financial assistance to meet this need and positively impact the mental health of the Music Biz members.” Sully Erna, lead singer of Godsmack and founder of the Scars Foundation, explains the organization’s name and why it was important to provide this resource for the music industry: “Scars come in all forms. They are both physical and emotional. They’re traumatizing and make us fear what people may think of us. We are ALL imperfect in some way, that’s what makes us perfect and unique! Everyone has something that makes them insecure or embarrassed. Instead of hiding or internalizing them, own them and show them off to the world! Let them empower you so you can be a voice for everyone who can’t be. If we ALL wear our scars loudly and proudly, others will follow. No matter what your scars are — abuse, mental illness, disabilities, bullying, addiction — none of them are defects, but a part of your unique story.” # # # # About the Music Business Association The Music Business Association (Music Biz) is a not-for-profit membership organization that advances, promotes and invests in the future of the music business by providing a trusted forum where ideas and cooperation flourish. Through events, education and engagement, the Association brings together the full breadth of the industry for unparalleled access to networking, resources and thought leadership.    About Music Health Alliance Based in Nashville, Music Health Alliance has provided free healthcare advocacy and support to more than 13,000 music industry members in 48 states across the U.S. and saved the music community more than $63,000,000 nationwide by providing advocacy and access to lifesaving transplants, medicine, mental health resources, end of life care and many other necessary services. In response to the pandemic, Music Health Alliance’s COVID-19 Relief Plan was created to provide direct support for the immediate needs of music industry professionals and their families during this public health crisis through relief grants, simplified solutions and a comprehensive database of resources. MHA fights so those in our industry never have to feel alone in a health crisis and removes obstacles so patients can receive lifesaving care. Its services are free to any person who has worked in the music industry for three or more years or who has credited contributions to 4 commercially released recordings or videos. Spouses, partners, and children of qualifying individuals may also receive access to the non-profit’s services from birth to end of life. Entirely funded through grants and individual and corporate donations, financial support from the music community is critical to continue Music Health Alliance’s (MHA) advocacy and free services.

How Should the Music Streaming Revenue Pie Be Split? - Music Business Worldwide;The following MBW op/ed comes from David Israelite (pictured), President and CEO of the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA). The NMPA is the trade association representing American music publishers and their songwriting partners. Beware of op-eds that seem encouraging but actually serve to misinform, blame and divide the music industry. Deep within a recent piece about how streaming is sustaining the music business, written by the head of a trade association representing the biggest tech companies in the world, was a breakdown bemoaning the fees that streaming platforms must pay for the music that makes their services possible. To fully grasp their perspective, one must first understand how the math really works. They assert that, “[a]ny honest reckoning of our business must examine what happens to the 69 cents of every dollar that digital music services pay to record companies, music publishers, and PROs.” Well let’s keep them honest by first correcting their math.  While the services assert that out of every $100 collected they pay over $55 to record labels, it’s actually closer to $52. They also say that $13.31 from the $100 must go song rightsholders, but the likes of Spotify actually currently pay only about 10.5% to music publishers and songwriters. That 10.5% is where it is because of the streaming services’ current Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) appeal in the US, which seeks to convince three judges that they should pay songwriters even less. While these may seem like small deviations, they amount to millions in revenue to struggling creators.  So in actuality, instead of $69, the real figure being paid out to music rightsholders from every $100 is closer to $62.50. This means streaming companies are keeping around 37.5% … to deliver music they didn’t create. Yet they still claim they pay too much. They also cynically blame payments to lawyers and managers and those that directly support creators. Music is one of those products that has value far beyond the sum of its parts. Many would say that music is invaluable, however unlike the music they deliver to consumers, streaming platforms’ value is quantifiable. They offer virtually unlimited music for a fee generally determined by what consumers are willing to pay in relation to other forms of music consumption. These platforms deserve credit for creating user-friendly interfaces to deliver songs to fans and for fans to discover music and, sometimes, pay subscriptions for that music. Most people would agree Spotify and others make music consumption cheap and easy, and therefore more people listen to even more music. “The problem is not how the pie is split, it is the size of the overall pie – and the fact that streaming companies expect to collect even more than a third for themselves.” More people discovering more music is good for the industry – particularly artists who can tour and sign endorsement deals based off their popularity. Songwriters on the other hand have seen their work consistently devalued by streaming and don’t have the same benefits from exposure. The problem is that since the dawn of streaming, the services themselves have sought to be seen as more than a music delivery service, and they have resented paying the songwriters who make their services possible – taking them to court time and time again and often blaming record labels for their inability to pay more. This breakdown makes clear that the money is there, they just expect to keep more of it for themselves. Consider other services and apps that deliver something to you, like Grubhub. The service didn’t create what it’s selling, it’s a vessel. It takes a reasonable commission, around 13% for delivery commission and processing fees, and still ends up profitable. Streaming companies are complaining about taking home many times that amount. So while they keep 37.5% of the revenue, the songs themselves are only getting 10.5% of the revenue. And keep in mind most songs have several writers. The services go on to allege that record labels and artists take the lion’s share of their payments – roughly $52 compared to publishers and songwriters’ combined $10.50. While this isn’t entirely accurate, this point is made in a cynical effort to split the creator side of the industry, which is not the issue at hand. The problem is not how the pie is split, it is the size of the overall pie – and the fact that streaming companies expect to collect even more than a third for themselves. The other problem is that publishers and songwriters’ hands are tied in the US when it comes to negotiating their rates by consent decrees and compulsory licenses – decades-old laws and regulations that amount to over 75% of songwriters’ income being largely controlled by federal government. Streaming services exploit these archaic rules to their advantage. Meanwhile labels and artists are in a free market, and therefore are able to negotiate for far more, as we should be. In court, Spotify and Amazon continue to argue they cannot possibly pay more, however recent headlines clearly prove otherwise. In December of last year, Spotify stock hit a record high and is valued at over $62 billion. In terms of how it values investment in talent, it just spent $100 million on acquiring the Joe Rogan podcast and a reported $200 million on The Ringer. There is ample evidence that there is no need to undervalue songwriters. “The facts are that streaming services do a great job of delivering music to users, but they did not create that music, so they should stop devaluing those who did.” Streaming services know that waging war in court to lower royalties is a bad look, so they have targeted the very top songwriters through public relations programs like Secret Genius where they spotlight successful writers in an attempt to distract from their counterefforts. The program includes award shows, global songwriting camps, and the opening of recording studios. This is all a smokescreen for the lawyers they are paying millions to convince the Copyright Royalty Board that they can’t afford to pay songwriters their current below-market rates. In fact, when some of the biggest writers honored by the program found out about the double-faced awards, they wrote Spotify expressing their anger saying, “we can see the real reason for your songwriter outreach. You have used us…”. There is no disputing that a system where people pay for music is better than an illicit one where people steal music. However, the basic premise of the streaming services’ argument is that songwriters and the industry at large should be so grateful that streaming has replaced the rampant piracy of platforms like Napster that preceded them, they should not expect a fair rate. This amounts to a sort of Stockholm Syndrome that we must resist. The facts are that streaming services do a great job of delivering music to users, but they did not create that music, so they should stop devaluing those who did. While these services celebrate that streaming music has sustained much of the industry during the difficult past year, at the same time, those same companies are fighting to lower what they pay music creators by a third.Music Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.

Music Business: Inside Zack Snyder’s ‘Justice League’ With Tom Holkenborg;"Thomas 'Tom' Holkenborg, otherwise known as JunkieXL, is the man behind the music that soundtracks ... [+] multiple multimillion-dollar IPs and franchises. “If I was to go back in time and say to myself, ‘Tom in 10 years, you will have come off eight years of being incredibly busy working with Robert Rodriguez, Zack Snyder, George Miller, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and Tim Miller,’ I would be like, ‘That sounds crazy.’ Sometimes I have to pinch myself.” Tom Holkenborg, otherwise known as Junkie XL, is the man behind the music that soundtracks multiple multimillion-dollar IPs and franchises. The Dutch full contact composer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer’s latest high profile project is Zack Snyder’s Justice League, aka Justice League: The Director's Cut. It’s also known by fans as the ‘Snyder Cut.’ “To be honest, the reason why it’s called the ‘Snyder Cut’ is that there was a Snyder Cut. I knew quite a long time ago that this was in the works and that it existed,” he confirmed. “This was not decided overnight. I had already done a lot of work for this project. It’s so exciting to see this version of the movie finally coming alive. Zack put a lot of time into the original version, I put a lot of time into in the original version, so it is great to have closure and that this is finally coming out.”  “It’s so great to work with Zack. This is like project number five for us. I have also finished Army of the Dead with him this year, and that movie comes out on Netflix

 next year. This whole year, it’s been like working with my best friends.” The original version of Justice League landed in theaters in November 2017. It grossed $657.9 million at the worldwide box office against a production budget of $300 million.  For Holkenborg, being able to revisit the project allowed him to complete his vision. “Besides the Man of Steel theme for Superman and the theme for Wonder Woman, which I have given a new spin, all the other themes for this movie are brand new,” he revealed. “Some of them I did the groundwork on four years ago, but as you grow as a composer, you look at what you did and maybe have a better way of doing it now or a better idea. It was inspiring. I would get an idea in my downtime and think, ‘Oh, let’s rework this thing. Let’s do that.’ Because I knew for a while that this was coming, I had the time and space to shape it into its best possible form.” “Different characters have different musical statements to those same characters in the past. Much like their stories in the comics, they change and evolve over the years. So, what was a great theme for Superman in the 70s doesn’t mean that it is the right theme for Superman in 2013. When the director takes on a superhero character, and when a composer takes on the superhero character, they should do what feels right inside them.” He added, “You should come up with a theme that inspires you for that character. I think that is important in the development of these movies. If Mad Max gets remade in 25 years, I’m not expecting people to do something similar to what I did for Fury Road, you know? Give it your take.” Thomas Holkenborg, aka JunkieXL, relaxing in studio. Mad Max: Fury Road, which grossed $375.2 million at the worldwide box office, is another acclaimed soundtrack on Holkenborg’s resume. Is it one he could return to? “George Miller, the director, and I talk all the time,” he said. “I know there are a lot of ideas floating around, but I have no idea what the realization of those is in terms of it being greenlit or not.” While some of his projects happen in a more traditional manner, such as Marvel’s Deadpool, others have been a happy accident. “A perfect example is the Godzilla vs. Kong movie that is coming out next year,” he enthused. “I’m such a Godzilla freak. I have all the Japanese versions of the movies. At a certain point, just for s**ts and giggles, I wrote something for Godzilla. About two years ago, I met the director because he showed interest in me as a composer. I asked him, ‘Do you know I’m the biggest Godzilla fan on the planet, and, years ago, I wrote some stuff.’ He was like, ‘You’re kidding me?’ So we started communicating, I tweaked what I did, played it for him, and he was totally in love.” He continues to work on smaller projects and TV projects such as Netflix’s White Lines and tentpole movies. One industry trend Holkenborg is very happy to see significant investment in sound and soundtracks.  “Studios, or at least the studios I’ve been working within my eight-year composer career, really want to help you realize what you’re trying to set out to do,” he explained. “I think it’s a fantastic development, and the result is working for them as a business. It is great to see that people enjoy listening to music from soundtracks. Sometimes the soundtrack goes beyond the movie fans and lands with the general public. I still get messages from people that say they listen to the Mad Max and Deadpool soundtracks when they work out at the gym.”  Holkenborg added, “Sometimes money’s not an issue. I worked with Peter Jackson on Mortal Engines, and I said to him that it would be great if I can make noises with all the props from the film and use that in the music. He got a hanger, threw the props in there plus a couple of trucks, and we went out there for a week. I was banging on all kinds of different props from the movie to create a sound library out of it.” “On Godzilla vs. Kong, I said, ‘I think we need the biggest bass drum on the planet for this score. I know the guy who can build it, what do you think?’ They just said, ‘Let's do it.’ So I said I want a bass drum that is at least eight feet in diameter,” he laughed. “The guy called me back, and he asked, ‘Is it okay if it’s only six?’ I said, ‘Could we do eight? Why can’t we do ten?’ The answer was, ‘Well, there’s simply no cow alive that has a skin big enough to cover for a ten-foot bass drum.’ So, we have to scale it down to eight.” “It was worth the money.” Justice League: The Director's Cut will hit HBO Max in 2021.";http://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2020/09/16/music-business-zack-snyder-justice-league-junkie-xl-tom-holkenborg-dcu-snyder-cut/?sh=771167975625, http://www.instagram.com/p/CKXoh7qgL-Z/;

Universal and LEGO launch augmented reality music video making app, VIDIYO - Music Business Worldwide;When Universal Music Group inked a deal with Denmark-born toy firm LEGO back in April 2020, the companies promised “a new interactive way of inspiring the next generation of fans and creative visionaries”. It was announced that the deal would be based around the development of a new suite of LEGO products launching in 2021, but no further details were confirmed. The two companies have now announced that new product: “an innovative music video maker experience” called LEGO VIDIYO, not dissimilar from short-form video apps like TikTok, but accessed via “a unique mashup” of LEGO elements, minifigures, music, augmented reality and a new app.  Aimed at children aged 7 -10, LEGO VIDIYO is described in a press release as “a brand-new way to play that helps children dream big by directing, producing, starring in, and sharing their own music videos, using tracks from across the globe, led by chart hits” from UMG artists. VIDIYO works by selecting a song in the App from a variety of UMG artists, including “both contemporary chart toppers and instantly recognisable classics”. You then create your band from a collection of new LEGO minifigures, which can be customised in different scales through AR technology in the VIDIYO App. Special effects such as confetti showers and X-ray vision can also be added using ‘BeatBits’, which are new decorated 2×2 square LEGO elements, which once scanned unlock digital effects that let you control everything from video and music styles to scene effects. Hitting the selected BeatBits in the App will trigger dance moves and audio/video effects in a 60 second performance, which can be trimmed down to 5, 10, 15 or 20 second shareable clips. Clips can then be uploaded to the App feed, but only once the content has passed moderation. LEGO reiterates that “any content featuring personally-identifiable information, such as children starring in the video, will not be approved for App feed upload”. The first LEGO VIDIYO products will be available in most countries around the world from March 1. “LEGO VIDIYO is a great way for millions of kids to discover new music and get closer to their favourite artists while learning and connecting through play.” Olivier Robert-Murphy, Universal Music Group Olivier Robert-Murphy, Executive Vice President, Universal Music Group and Brands added: “Through this innovative global partnership – with the power of music and play harnessed to support early development of creativity – children around the globe will be able to express themselves as they stage, direct, perform, and share their music videos. “LEGO VIDIYO is a great way for millions of kids to discover new music and get closer to their favourite artists while learning and connecting through play.” “We want to feed the imagination of the next generation of creatives, providing a new canvas for kids to creatively express themselves.” Julia Goldin, the LEGO Group Julia Goldin, Chief Marketing Officer, the LEGO Group, said: “We want to feed the imagination of the next generation of creatives, providing a new canvas for kids to creatively express themselves.” “Research shows over three quarters (79%*) of parents globally wish their children had more creative confidence, so we’re launching LEGO VIDYO to help make that happen. “We know children are always chasing new ways to experiment creatively, and LEGO VIDIYO is here to help all kids with a passion for music unleash their creativity through LEGO building and music video production. We can’t wait to see what they come up with!”Music Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.

Hitting all the right notes - Georgia Southern music industry degree ready to launch | Spotlight by Georgia Southern University;"Georgia Southern University’s Department of Music earned national accreditation for a new music industry degree, the final step for an innovative program that combines music, technology and entrepreneurship. Launching in the fall of 2021, the new music industry program will prepare musicians for evolving careers in music. The program curriculum combines a traditional degree with 21st-century technology and performance opportunities.    Accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) allows the new program, Bachelor of Arts in Music with a concentration in music industry, to be offered at the Armstrong Campus in Savannah. Students will have the option of declaring an emphasis area in music technology or music business.      “We could not be more excited about this program,” said Steven A. Harper, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Music. “For many years, the music program has been itching to expand its reach and regional impact. Savannah is perfectly suited for a degree of this type and we couldn’t be more pleased to have this degree come to fruition.”    The music industry program includes courses in music management, live sound, recording studio techniques, digital audio workstations and music entrepreneurship.  “The numerous music industries in Savannah include music manufacturers, performing organizations/venues and major music festivals. These industries can provide ample internship possibilities for hands-on experience in a chosen area,” Harper said. “We are able to reach a student body we’ve never been able to serve before. We can prepare students for a whole different set of in-demand careers and we can create ties with the music industry in Savannah in a way that’s never been possible for us until now. It’s going to be a huge boon for the department, the college, the university and the Armstrong Campus.”  One professor key to the program will be Stephen Primatic, DMA, who teaches percussion, theory, jazz and music technology. His versatility is evidenced by the books he has written: two on percussion pedagogy and another on instrument maintenance and repair.    “This program will be beneficial to our students, the University and the community of Savannah, offering education and training for music careers in the 21st century,” said Primatic.  If you are a journalist looking to know more about the Bachelor of Arts in Music with a concentration in music industry or would like to interview Steven A. Harper, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Music or Professor Stephen Primatic  -- simply reach out to Georgia Southern Director of Communications Jennifer Wise at jwise@georgiasouthern.edu to set and time and date.

"FireSpike participates in the First Annual ""Ultimate Music Business Summit"" - Web Development and Services from FIRESPIKE LLC - 503-928-7789";"by Arthur Breur | Jan 29, 2021 | Newsletter On January 7-9, 2021, the first annual “Ultimate Music Business Summit” premiered with 27 online presentations and multiple live panels, each discussing different business topics specifically in terms of how they relate to people who work—any level and any amount—within the music industry. The summit was the brainchild of Dr. Garrett Hope, who is a composer, speaker, writer, and the host of The Portfolio Composer podcast—which (as of my writing this) has recently released its 234th episode! I was very proud and honored that I was one of the first resources Garrett reached out to when he started planning this summit. Because I not only own FireSpike but also am a composer myself, Garrett interviewed me in his 72nd podcast (back in 2016!), specifically about websites for composers. And so it was that he reached out to me on November 20, 2020, explained the idea of the summit, and asked if I would be willing to include my expertise on the subject in one of the summit’s pre-recorded video presentations. I was more than happy to! My video presentation, “Websites 101 for Musicians”, was on the Day 1 lineup of videos in the three-day summit and received very good feedback. It was very rewarding to hear from many participants that the information I had included was practical and helpful. In addition to the video, FireSpike held a drawing for the free installation of a WordPress website, 90 minutes of WordPress Training, and one year of Essential Hands On Monthly Maintenance & Hosting. Composer and multi-instrumentalist Megan Harton was one of about 20 participants in the summit who entered FireSpike’s drawing: “…I would love a website that serves as a portfolio of my compositions, as well as a place to find my bio, links to my social media and recordings, upcoming events and contact information. Perhaps even a  of different services such as commissions, lessons, live performance, presenting/speaking engagements.” I look forward to working with Megan to launch her new site and show her how easily she can manage all of those things using WordPress. Stay tuned for news about the launch date for her new site!

 Professor Katz teaches courses on music and technology, popular music and modern art music 
                          The scholarship of Mark Katz focuses on music and technology, musical diplomacy, contemporary popular music, and the violin. He has written three books, “Capturing Sound: How Technology has Changed Music,” “The Violin: A Research and Information Guide,” and “Groove Music: The Art and Culture of the Hip-Hop DJ.” He co-edited (with Timothy Taylor and Tony Grajeda) the collection “Music, Sound, and Technology in America.” He is former editor of Journal of the Society for American Music and served many years on the National Recording Preservation Board.Katz teaches music and technology, popular music, and modern art music. In 2011 he received an Innovation Grant from UNC’s Institute for the Arts and Humanities to expand the scope and reach of university-level music pedagogy. One result was the creation of new courses including The Art and Culture of the DJ, Beat Making Lab, Rap Lab, and Rock Lab. Aimed at students without formal musical training, these courses introduce students to composition, performance, music history, entrepreneurship and community engagement.Since 2013, Katz has been awarded more than $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of State to create and run Next Level, a program that sends U.S. hip-hop artists abroad to foster cultural exchange, conflict prevention and entrepreneurship. Since 2014 the program has conducted workshops in 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Central America. In 2016–17 the program travels to Algeria, Brazil, Croatia, Cuba, Indonesia and Tunisia. His work promoting the arts and music education in underserved communities has been recognized through awards from the Freedoms Foundation, the Hip-Hop Education Center and Indy Weekly.A former chair of the Department of Music, Katz became director of UNC’s Institute for the Arts and Humanities in 2014. Katz lectures frequently on music and has been a guest speaker at universities and other institutions throughout the United States and Europe, including talks and keynote lectures at the British Library, Brown, Cambridge, Case Western, Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Harvard, Minnesota, Northwestern, Oxford, the Sacher Stiftung, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Stanford and the University of Turku. He also addresses general audiences through radio and newspaper interviews, blog posts, Web chats and other engagements.When he has time, Katz is a violinist, an amateur turntablist and a DJ at UNC’s radio station, WXYC 89.3 FM.

                              During the week of April 13–17, professional hip-hop artists from Africa, Asia, and Europe will be in residence at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to participate in workshops, panel discussions, jam sessions, and public performances. The residency is part of the Next Level program, an international musical exchange and diplomacy initiative funded by the U.S. Department of State and run by UNC-Chapel Hill.

“We expect this to be the experience of a lifetime, not only for the visiting artists, but for everyone they meet,” said Mark Katz, Director of Next Level, and a music professor at UNC.                             view more College of Arts and Sciences  online  2014-10-29

                              What do Carolina’s faculty need? Mark Katz starts to say “freedom,” and stops. Instead, he settles on “time.”

For many academics, the two are one and the same. Time means the freedom to create away from the classroom, the chance to take stock of skills and develop new dreams or perform research without a rush.

Now, he’s at the helm of a place he calls his “second home.” On July 1, Katz took over as director of the IAH, an interdisciplinary center dedicated to helping Carolina faculty develop their talents and goals.                             view more Carolina Arts & Sciences  print  2014-03-01 
                              Creative writing professor Bland Simpson remembers well the first time he met music professor Mark Katz. It was the first week of classes in spring of 2013, and Simpson was teaching the inaugural “Collaboration: Composers and Lyricists” course in a Hill Hall classroom. Katz’s students were jamming in “The Art and Culture of the DJ” in the room right above Simpson’s class.

Music Business Association Partners With Scars Foundation and Music Health Alliance to Establish Mental Health Fund - Music Business Association;"Newly formed fund will help provide struggling Association members with essential mental health services January 28, 2021 — The Music Business Association (Music Biz) today announces the formation of the Music Business Mental Health Fund, established in partnership with Music Health Alliance (MHA) and the Scars Foundation. The fund was created to help Association members impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic gain access to important mental health services, including screenings and therapy sessions. “The increased stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have shed more light on something we’ve already come to know: access to mental health services is essential in sustaining our professional success and, more importantly, our individual well-being,” said Music Biz President Portia Sabin. “Our industry has only weathered the lasting effects of this pandemic through collaboration; as such, Music Biz is thrilled to partner with Music Health Alliance and the Scars Foundation to offer these vital services to those in our member community who need them.” The Music Business Mental Health Fund is open to qualified employees of Music Biz member companies, individual professional members, and people who were furloughed or laid off from a Music Biz member company in 2020. Nashville-based non-profit Music Health Alliance, which provides free healthcare advocacy and support to the nationwide music community, will administer the fund with 100% confidentiality, overseeing applications for assistance and disbursement of funds. For more information on the fund, a full list of qualifications, and access to the application, visit MusicHealthAlliance.com. “I have been a member of Music Biz for five years now, and honestly I have never met a group of people more willing and dedicated to helping others in our industry,” said Scars Foundation Executive Director Naomi Fabricant. “There is such a like-minded energy of ‘anything we can do to help is what we are here for,’ and as someone who has been in the music business for many years, I appreciate that more than words can say. Because of this, the SCARS Foundation thought that Music Biz and MHA would be the right partner to help us deliver mental health services to our community.” “Our daily interaction with music industry professionals through the COVID-19 pandemic has graphically exposed the need for access to mental health services,” said Tatum Allsep, founder and CEO of Music Health Alliance. “Thanks to the foresight of Godsmack’s SCARS Foundation and the Music Biz Association, Music Health Alliance can provide immediate navigation and financial assistance to meet this need and positively impact the mental health of the Music Biz members.” Sully Erna, lead singer of Godsmack and founder of the Scars Foundation, explains the organization’s name and why it was important to provide this resource for the music industry: “Scars come in all forms. They are both physical and emotional. They’re traumatizing and make us fear what people may think of us. We are ALL imperfect in some way, that’s what makes us perfect and unique! Everyone has something that makes them insecure or embarrassed. Instead of hiding or internalizing them, own them and show them off to the world! Let them empower you so you can be a voice for everyone who can’t be. If we ALL wear our scars loudly and proudly, others will follow. No matter what your scars are — abuse, mental illness, disabilities, bullying, addiction — none of them are defects, but a part of your unique story.” # # # # About the Music Business Association The Music Business Association (Music Biz) is a not-for-profit membership organization that advances, promotes and invests in the future of the music business by providing a trusted forum where ideas and cooperation flourish. Through events, education and engagement, the Association brings together the full breadth of the industry for unparalleled access to networking, resources and thought leadership.    About Music Health Alliance Based in Nashville, Music Health Alliance has provided free healthcare advocacy and support to more than 13,000 music industry members in 48 states across the U.S. and saved the music community more than $63,000,000 nationwide by providing advocacy and access to lifesaving transplants, medicine, mental health resources, end of life care and many other necessary services. In response to the pandemic, Music Health Alliance’s COVID-19 Relief Plan was created to provide direct support for the immediate needs of music industry professionals and their families during this public health crisis through relief grants, simplified solutions and a comprehensive database of resources. MHA fights so those in our industry never have to feel alone in a health crisis and removes obstacles so patients can receive lifesaving care. Its services are free to any person who has worked in the music industry for three or more years or who has credited contributions to 4 commercially released recordings or videos. Spouses, partners, and children of qualifying individuals may also receive access to the non-profit’s services from birth to end of life.

Exactuals’ PaymentHub passes $1bn in all-time dollars processed - Music Business Worldwide;Los Angles-based financial software company Exactuals has reported that its flagship PaymentHub product saw 250% year-over-year growth over the past 12 months, and passed $1 billion in all-time dollars processed. PaymentHub allows studios, unions, guilds, payroll companies, music publishers, record labels, distributors and marketplaces to provide direct deposit payments, tax document management and online reporting to rights-holders, performers, managers, service providers and independent contractors worldwide. According to the company, this automated system reduces or eliminates the need for costly paper checks and reporting.    Exactuals reports that PaymentHub’s growth was driven by an expanding client base, which the company says grew at more than 100% in 2020. Exactuals also notes that its acquisition of Backlash Solutions in January 2020 contributed to this growth.  In addition to PaymentHub, Exactuals recently launched RAI – an artificial intelligence tool used by record labels and publishers to optimize ownership metadata for the calculation and payment of royalties. Founded in 2011 by Mike Hurst, Exactuals was acquired by City National Bank in 2018 for an undisclosed sum. In February 2017, City National participated in a $10 million round of funding for Exactuals. “I am proud to say, Exactuals represents the safest and fastest path to payment modernization in the industries we serve.” Mike Hurst, Exactuals “The extraordinary growth of PaymentHub over the past year is exciting, and we expect to see the trend continue in 2021,” said Mike Hurst, Co-Founder and CEO of Exactuals. “The support of City National and Royal Bank of Canada has accelerated growth for our business by removing any market concerns around scale. When we were small and independent, we had to fight to prove we were a safe bet. “Today, as a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the world’s largest banks, our clients know they are working with a trusted and stable global institution that puts security and business continuity above all else. “City National and Exactuals are proud to reach this momentous milestone.” Verna Grayce Chao, City National Bank Verna Grayce Chao, Executive Vice President in charge of City National Bank’s Treasury Management Solutions, added: “City National has always been there for the entertainment industry, and during the pandemic we have doubled down to provide our clients with better, faster, and more efficient service. “We have a client obsessed culture and we’re dedicated to meeting our clients’ unique needs. PaymentHub allows us to do just that. “We’re providing leading technology-based solutions that have replaced outdated processes, paper checks and manual reporting – providing greater security, accuracy, transparency and speed.

  A NEW business venture that wants to help musicians in Barrow is looking to showcase their skills this weekend with an exciting music event.
 
  Lock In, which was set up by Barrow-based DJs and musicians, wants to give back to their community by sharing their knowledge and skills within the music industry.
 
  To do this they have rented studio space Duke Street just this month, after raising money for Furness charities Mind-In-Furness and Barrow Foodbank through streamed DJ sets.
 
  Mal Lingard, one of the team that runs The Lock In, said: ""It's a community interest company born from live DJ sets and musicians doing sets from their home to raise money for firstly the foodbank and then Mind during lockdown.
 
  ""We are now going to take it forward to a studio space where we are running radio shows, live sets, producing, videoing bands, as well as running blog articles on music and opinion pieces.
 
    BREAK: Taking a rest from filming
   
  ""We intend to start interviewing local businesses and showcasing their talents too. In addition to this we will start running workshops on all aspects of music and video creation.
 
  ""Our launch date is Saturday. With a massive concert screening of massive local act Liars Club. It was a socially distanced concert filmed at the Roxy by director Ethan Hughes.""
 
    Roxy Cinema
   
  The Barrow-based band had just started to get noticed before the coronavirus lockdown stopped them in their tracks, and Mal hopes Liars Club are one of many acts from the area to benefit from their expertise.
 
  The team at Locked In consists of Gary Mallington, Joshua Morrison, Liam Blackley, Andy Graham, Robbie Gallagher, and Grant Hamilton, who all agreed Roxy Cinema in Ulverston was an ideal venue to stream this gig as well as being a 'marvel to take in'.
 
  The Barrow Eats sponsored event will be available tomorrow on their website: thelockin.live

MBW’s Weekly Roundup: Universal, Sun Records, DistroKid, Spotify, Big Hit - Music Business Worldwide;"Welcome to Music Business Worldwide’s weekly round-up – where we make sure you caught the five biggest stories to hit our headlines over the past seven days. MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip, which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs. This week, it was announced by Universal Music Group parent company Vivendi that a Tencent-led consortium has completed its acquisition of an additional 10% in UMG. Vivendi also suggested within the announcement today (January 29), that the proposed ‘spin-out’ IPO of Universal Music Group could happen this year. Meanwhile, we learned yesterday (January 28) that Primary Wave has acquired the legendary Sun Records in what the New York Times reports is a $30m deal, including master recordings for the likes of Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and others. Elsewhere, music distributor DistroKid has launched a new ‘matchmaking’ service to help record labels find unsigned artists, with Republic Records named as its first partner. Plus, Spotify has been granted a patent for an invention that monitors your speech to determine your emotional state, while K-Pop powerhouse Big Hit Entertainment has invested approximately $63m in rival YG Entertainment via subsidiary YG PLUS. A Tencent-led consortium has completed its acquisition of an additional 10% in Universal Music Group, both Tencent and UMG parent Vivendi announced this morning (January 29). As previously announced, the Tencent consortium has acquired the shares in UMG for €3 billion based on a €30 billion enterprise valuation of the music company. The acquisition takes the Tencent consortium’s holding in UMG from 10% to 20%, and reduces UMG parent Vivendi’s ownership stake in the music firm to 80%. Within its announcement of the Tencent news this morning, Vivendi also suggested that that the proposed ‘spin-out’ IPO of Universal Music Group could happen this year. “Following the success of this significant strategic transaction, a UMG listing is planned in early 2022 at the latest,” said Vivendi. (We already knew Vivendi was planning a Universal IPO before an unspecified point in 2022; The words “early 2022 at the latest” today represent new information.) Primary Wave Music has acquired legendary recording company Sun Records. Described by Primary Wave as a “multi-million deal”, the transaction encompasses master recordings for legendary artists including Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, The Dixie Cups, and more. The buyout also includes all of the music publishing owned by Sun, as well as the iconic Sun Records logo and all other trademarks owned by Sun, including that of Nashville’s Sun Diner. John Singleton, President of Sun Records, will remain at the label, and Primary Wave says he will now have additional resources provided by the company under the terms of the deal. The New York Times reports that the deal “is estimated at about $30m”. DistroKid has a good claim to be the biggest music distributor in the world. It says it distributes approximately a third of all new music released around the globe, and that more than 2 million artists rely on its platform. Now, the company is opening up a new line of business: enabling major and indie record companies to mine its data, and getting paid a finder’s fee each time one of these labels signs a DistroKid artist. According to DistroKid Founder and CEO Philip Kaplan, this new service, Upstream, meets a need for both artists and labels. Remember when Spotify was granted a patent for personality tracking technology, and how unsettling it was? Published in October 2020, the filing explained that behavioural variables, such as a user’s mood, their favourite genre of music, or their demographic could all prospectively “correspond to different personality traits of a user”. Spotify suggested that it could promote personalized content – presumably audio advertising content, but also perhaps music and podcast content – to users based on the personality traits it detected in them. Now, according to details published in a new US Spotify patent, the company wants to use technology to get even deeper into its users’ heads, by using speech recognition to determine their “emotional state, gender, age, or accent” – attributes that can then be used to recommend content. Big Hit Entertainment, the K-Pop powerhouse behind BTS, has revealed its intention to invest 70 billion won (approximately $63m) in rival K-Pop company YG Entertainment. Seoul-based YG Entertainment, founded by Yang Hyun-suk in 1996, has worked with K Pop superstars like BLACKPINK, BIGBANG, 2NE1, and Psy.Yang Hyun-suk left the company in June 2019. In 2018, Universal Music Group and Interscope announced a global deal to represent YG Entertainment’s biggest artist, girl band BLACKPINK, outside of Asia. Big Hit is investing its money in YG merch and distribution affiliate, YG Plus.

Sherrese Clarke Soares, CEO of $1bn-backed acquisition fund Tempo Music Investments, exits company - Music Business Worldwide;The CEO of a billion-dollar player in the acquisitive music fund space just left the building. MBW has learned that Sherrese Clarke Soares is exiting her role as CEO of Tempo Music Investments, a heavily-financed rival to the likes of Hipgnosis Songs Fund, Round Hill Music, and Primary Wave. Soares says she is departing Tempo to launch her own venture. New York-based Tempo is a portfolio company of Providence Equity Partners. Tempo publicly arrived on the scene in November 2019, when it launched with $650 million to spend on music copyrights via equity and debt capacity, with most of the equity coming from Providence. At that time, the fund announced it had partnered with Warner Music Group to handle distribution of its recorded music assets, and administration of its publishing rights. According to its website, Tempo Music Investments’ “extensive portfolio” now features “work by global artists including Bruno Mars, Alicia Keys, Jonas Brothers, Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Ariana Grande, Pink, and many more”. The website also claims that Tempo has over $1 billion of investible capital at its disposal, suggesting it has added significant funds to its war-chest since that December 2019 announcement. The Tempo site reads: “We share a belief that content is Queen. As established leaders and investors we’re actively pursuing opportunities derived from the distribution and consumption of global content, across all genres.” When Tempo was launched in 2019, it was revealed that the company had already acquired the music publishing catalogs of songwriter/producers Jeff Bhasker, Shane McAnally, and Ben Rector. These assets are understood to themselves have been acquired from Influence Media Partners, which used Morgan Stanley money to buy them in the first place in 2018. Prior to launching Tempo, Sherrese Clarke Soares spent over 10 years at Morgan Stanley, most recently as the founder and head of the investment giant’s Entertainment, Media, & Sports Structured Solutions division, focusing on intellectual property assets. In a note to colleagues sent yesterday (January 28) and obtained by MBW, Clarke Soares wrote: “Being the founder of Tempo awakened my entrepreneurial spirit and has been one of the major highlights of my career. Despite the birthing of Tempo as a result of several years of hard work at Morgan Stanley, I made the decision to resign as CEO to start my own venture.” She added: “As many of you know, what is Tempo today started from a blank piece of paper and a call from a dear friend and colleague, Drew Hawkins, in 2015. None of what was accomplished at Tempo could have been done without having exceptional partners – my colleagues at Morgan Stanley, my friends at Warner Music Group, and the team at Providence.” “Despite the birthing of Tempo as a result of several years of hard work at Morgan Stanley, I made the decision to resign as CEO to start my own venture.” Sherrese Clarke Soares Noting that Tempo was “well-positioned for future success”, Clarke Soares continued: “2020 taught me a lot about faith, resilience, perseverance, and intention. In a year with so much uncertainty and disruption to our daily lives, 2020 provided me with extreme clarity to focus on what is important. As such, I am off to pursue the next chapter, building an investment platform that will be the culmination of my values and my learnings over the last 20+ years.” Meanwhile, the music catalog acquisitions space continues to heat up: yesterday, Primary Wave announced it had fully acquired Sun Records and its catalog of masters including classic tracks by Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Denis Ladegaillerie shares his vision on how we can reinvent our business for artists to thrive in this new uncertain context. And looks at the next evolution of the industry: the rise of independent artists and the switch to a partnership-based model between music companies and talents. –  With dual academic education in Business Law and Management (Paris School of Management ESCP, Master of Law at Duke University North Carolina), Denis Ladegaillerie passed the New York Bar in 1997. He started his career as Business Lawyer at Shearman & Sterling where he practiced from 1997 to 2000. He joined the financial department of Vivendi at the beginning of 2000 to take care of the restructuring of the portfolio of companies in the internet sector of the group.

Every month, our conference team presents visionary conversations with the most respected decision makers of the global music industry to share insightful business tips, case studies, and technical solutions.    Here’s a selection of the most insightful quotes or anecdotes from his talk: “For 2010 to 2020 the headline was the rise of streaming. 2020 to 2030, I think the headline is going to be the rise of local independent artists.”   “If you take the top 200 most streamed artists across most markets around the world right now, they’re not top stars, they’re very very big local artists. Local language plays a key role, but this is really the switch from what I would say a pop-music centric model that favoured the build-up of global stars to an artist-centric model that favors local artists and diversity.”   “Building up eye to eye, respectful and partnership relationships with artists, building an expertise on what it takes to build an artists’ career in the digital world and building the technology backbone that allows you to have a great understanding of what’s happening in the market: these are the key factors of success in the market of tomorrow.” Comments are closed.;http://ow.ly/mVUJ50DeCWm;
Spotify Secures Horrifying Patent to Monitor Users' Speech;"Spotify wants to know your ""emotional state, gender, age, or accent"" If you listen to Spotify, then soon enough Spotify may listen to you. Via Music Business Worldwide, the streaming platform has secured a patent to monitor the background noise and speech of its users. The big green circle first filed a patent for its “Identification of taste attributes from an audio signal” product in February of 2018,  and finally received approval on January 12th, 2021. The goals is to gauge listener’s “emotional state, gender, age, or accent,” in order to recommend new music. But wait, you might ask, isn’t there an easier way to find out someone’s age and what kind of music they like? Perhaps, for example, by asking them? According to the patent application, that would require consumers “to tediously input answers to multiple queries in order for the system to identify the user’s tastes”. In the full filing, Spotify argues that, “What is needed is an entirely different approach to collecting taste attributes of a user, particularly one that is rooted in technology so that the above-described human activity (e.g., requiring a user to provide input) is at least partially eliminated and performed more efficiently.” Spotify wants to keep tabs on your “intonation, stress, rhythm and the likes of units of speech” in order to know if you’re feeling “happy, angry, sad or neutral.” The technology will also monitor environmental metadata, using “sounds from vehicles on a street, other people talking, birds chirping, printers printing, and so on” in order to further customize their recommendations. Because who wants to self-reflect on your emotional state when a soulless corporation can do it for you? Besides that, Spotify seems weirdly obsessed with your genitals. The word “gender” appears over and over again, and part of the patent includes a “gender recognition system [that] can be used to extract the gender related information from a speech signal.” After all, it would be terrible to listen to good music if a streaming platform thinks it’s intended for someone with a different gender identity.

Musician Workers Union Launches “Justice at Spotify” Campaign Demanding One Cent Per Stream


 In a statement to Pitchfork, a representative of Spotify said that the company may or may not start moonlighting as Big Brother. They wrote, “Spotify has filed patent applications for hundreds of inventions, and we regularly file new applications. Some of these patents become part of future products, while others don’t. Our ambition is to create the best audio experience out there, but we don’t have any news to share at this time.” That’s the PR equivalent of a shrug emoji. If you’re considering extending Spotify even the teensiest benefit of the doubt, remember this is the same company whose CEO blamed artists for not making enough money, saying “you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.” The platform also offered to boost artists’ algorithm placement in exchange for reduced royalties. In response to these and other policies, the Musician Workers Union launched a “Justice at Spotify” campaign demanding one cent per stream.

Janika Groß Is Back for a New Interview in 2021 | by Rui Alves 🇺🇦 | Rock n’Heavy;"Rock n’Heavy Jan 27, 2021 Save Early this month, I published my first interview with Janika. This was back in 2013, and molllust had just released their seminal Opera Metal album Schuld (2012). Now that the band is working on finalizing their new album, Mother Universe, Janika was kind enough to come back for another insightful interview about the past, present, and future of molllust. Last year, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck humanity. How did the new coronavirus impact your life as an artist and performer with Haggard and molllust? I can’t recall when I played so few concerts the last time. Most of the time, I am at home, working on tasks for molllust like the virtual orchestration of the new album or updating our webshop. The few concerts we could do in the times without lockdown were social distancing concerts. This means fewer and mainly seated audience in a club or open-air — a really strange experience! With molllust, we could play in some clubs that would have been still too big in normal times, which was quite cool for the stage show. With Haggard, we did double shows — that’s very exhausting if you play twice a day, but all in all, you still have less audience than at a usual single show. But it is definitely better than playing not at all. Recently, the band had to postpone all concerts to an indefinite date, for an artist, I can imagine this is almost the same as being unemployed. Can you share your thoughts about this issue? Yes, it is almost impossible to plan any shows at the moment. In addition, promoters and venues are uncertain about how to proceed. So we focus on recording our upcoming album in order to use the time in the best way possible. Such a recording process is a time with few concerts anyway as you can’t do both at the same time. So let’s hope we can enter the stage again when everything is ready! Talking about concerts, how was the experience of playing at Wacken Open Air? Absolutely overwhelming! It was a big chance, and we were mind blown to be part of such a big event. It took me quite a while to digest all the impressions of these days. I was really nervous that everything would work as planned and did my best until the very last minute to prepare everything as well as possible. I am never completely satisfied and always see what could have been even better, but nevertheless, I totally enjoyed the time. We worked for so long to finally get the chance to play such a concert, and I am proud we made it. I hope we can continue with such great shows when the pandemic is over! Molllust decided to go “against all odds” and record a new album — Mother Universe— during the pandemic. What drove you to that purpose? The recording of the album was planned anyway; the compositions were done before the pandemic started — we just got a bit delayed thanks to all the restrictions. In Deep Waters was released in 2015, so it is time for some new music! Are there any connections between Mother Universe and the COVID-19 pandemic? No, the concept was finished before we knew a pandemic would come. Nevertheless, the album deals with several problems of our time, e.g., climate change, pollution, and wars. During these difficult times, I can imagine this wasn’t an easy task. You held a fundraiser campaign to help with the recording costs. Do you think this type of campaign can help artists with their creative projects? Any advice or insight you would like to share with your fellow artists? Money is a big issue for every upcoming artist. You want to release a professional product, but you still don’t have the income of big bands, so you have to deal with a limited budget and spend a lot out of your own pockets. Growing as a band means a huge investment in money and time. Therefore it is very helpful that the fans you already have can help you to realize your musical vision. My advice would be that you have to share the campaign a lot so every fan gets to know that you are currently collecting money for new music and that you have a plan beforehand what you can already show to the people as they want to know what to expect. Back in April 2020, you explained how Mother Universe would be a conceptual album taking us across the planets of our Solar System. Please could you further explain its concept? The planets of our solar system are named after the ancient Roman gods. The lyrics are inspired by the duties of those and also by the appearance of these galactic worlds. In addition, I combined these inspirations with the challenges of our recent time. As always, lyrics and music are linked closely — the sounds reflect the emotions of the texts. In order to emphasize the different characteristics of the planets as individual worlds, I also created different soundscapes. The instruments and the size of the orchestra related to each planet vary a lot, although everything is still a mixture of Classical Music and Metal. Furthermore, the musical pieces will be linked with small instrumental interludes on the album. Did you compose all music and write the lyrics? What can you share about the inspiration and creative process behind Mother Universe? Yes, but my bandmates are a great help with their feedback and suggestions to improve the compositions. Also, our producer Joost van den Broek gave feedback to transform the songs into their best possible versions. My inspiration is everything that happens around me and touches me emotionally or raises questions and thoughts in my mind. In what direction is the new album going, when compared to its predecessors? It is more orchestral driven, and as we have two guitars now, you will also find some more playful guitar lines and solos on it. How was working alongside Julian Jönck, from Conspiria, in the orchestras for both your new symphonic metal releases? Very helpful! He used to work with sample libraries for quite a while already, while for me, it is completely new to add programmed instruments to the real ones. So he helps me a lot to realize my musical vision. Also, it motivates you if you are not always alone with your computer! And we can lend each other an ear when we worked for a while on a passage to get new input. Talking about the orchestral composition process, I would love to know more about it. From my layman’s perspective, I can only imagine the amount of expertise required. I took some lessons in instrumentation, read books about orchestration, and listened carefully to a lot of pieces, analyzing their structure to develop my skills further before starting to work on the new album. Composing is a process of constant learning; you always explore something new. I feel like I already developed a lot, but at the same time, I also see a lot of aspects where I wish to be more experienced. I love this constant challenge! During the rehearsal and the recording process, the feedback of my fellow musicians and our producer helped me to get an even deeper understanding and to develop even more. I already know on what I want to improve for the next album. I guess I will never be done with exploring the world of music; it seems endless. Are all the band members currently working from “lockdown-home-prison” like Frank Schumacher? I know Frank finished rhythm guitar and bass, and Julian the lead guitar recordings. How is it going from a global perspective? We have already finished recording the metal section. For drums, we used the time between the lockdowns in spring and winter for rehearsing and recording. We also prepared the string recordings, but currently, we can’t go altogether to the studio due to the Corona restrictions. Therefore the string players are forced to rehearse alone until we can finally continue the recording process. For most musicians, it is quite a tough time, as it also results in fewer jobs. So they can’t only focus on the band but also have to find ways to make ends meet. Back on 26 June, in a Facebook post, you promised the new album would have “more guitar notes than the previous ones,” will you deliver and make it even louder? The overall sound will be richer due to the second guitar and the orchestral approach — but there is a huge difference between the songs. You’ll find everything from chamber music-like arrangements to epic soundscapes on the upcoming release. How was recording with your producer Joost van den Broek at Sandlane Recording Facilities? How do you record an album these days with all the social distancing and respiratory etiquette measures? This isn’t so easy indeed. We started to send around files and fully discussed the preproduction via videochats and mails. For the guitars, we recorded everything at home, and Joost reamped them with the final sound in the studio. Our time in September with Joost to record the drums in Holland was a great experience for us, and I am already looking forward to continuing with strings and vocals as soon as the situation allows it! Can you already foresee a release date? How do you plan to release it? Not yet, as it totally depends on when we will be able to finish the recordings and when we can play shows to celebrate the release. I would guess autumn to winter, depending on the situation. We will also do some music videos and promote the album online. In case we have to wait long for the concerts, we will start with the videos some time beforehand, so you can already enjoy some impressions of the release. I recently discovered your studio harpist, Carmen Alcantara Fernandez. What can you share about her work with molllust? She is a very skilled concert harpist. The previous albums had a lot of solistic piano parts. I decided to reduce those to give more space to other colors of sounds — sometimes other keyboard instruments like celesta or organ, sometimes just space for our string players and guitarists, and sometimes it was just not necessary because of the orchestral soundscapes. The harp provides a very special color — in some calmer pieces, it takes over the leading role of the piano. In other songs, it adds a lot of spice to the orchestration. Carmen instantly connected with the music and perfectly provided all the colors of sound I imagined, while being super nice and highly focused. I felt like a child on Christmas Eve while we were in the studio and recorded the lines! They will be a great part of the album! What’s the most important question you would like to see in this interview. And shame on me, I missed it 😊 please forgive me, and could you answer it? The most important ones concerning our new album you already asked. J But I would add: What are your thoughts about the future of the music industry? At the moment, I am really worried about the impact of the pandemic. It is not only the musicians I am worrying about, but also the clubs and festivals and all the people that make a living out of it. We had a lot of structural problems in the music industry beforehand. Small to middle-sized bands and clubs were already struggling to survive without the impact of the pandemic. I wonder what’s left afterward and what we can change to develop a more sustainable music industry in the future. If we just go back to normal afterward and don’t change anything, music and culture will suffer on the longhand since the current system isn’t really working. I hope that the pandemic made us realize how fragile our structures are and learn from it and improve. Anything else you would like to share with your fans? As much as I love music, my biggest concern is the well-being of everyone. So I hope we can all stick together to fight this pandemic the best way possible and to meet again in the future, even if it means that we have to step back at the moment. Don’t lose your hope and make the best of this special time. If it means a forced break for you, take it as a chance to rest and to reflect, and to make plans for the future. If it means a lot of work, I wish you all the strength you need to deal with it. And when times seem dark, remember: There will also be times full of light again. I hope to meet you all save and sound again, be it virtually or at a concert in the future! A word of recognition and many thanks to you, Janika for your valuable time and for sharing your personal experience with us. Rock n’Heavy readers and molllust fans worldwide will appreciate every word you were so kind to share with us. I look forward to listening to Mother Universe and talking with you again in the near future. Best of luck for molllust and many successes for the upcoming release. 678 678 678 Rock n’Heavy has been around the web since 2010.

Shitty Mashups | Shitty Mashups;"SHITTY MASHUPS A Music Podcast for People who Hate Music This week the boys do their best to make soul mashups, despite being completely unqualified to do so. Is the outcome good? That's for history to decide. But given the standard for podcasts run by three white dudes... the outlook isn't great. First, I do like this
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat till it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off me shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off me face
Hop back up then I start to slide
Popping my collar as I glide
Then I break the thang down and do The Bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on everybody now's the chance
Fuck the Harlem Shake, this the Thizzle Dance! Get a nice big cup of some sort of hot beverage, snuggle up under the covers, and get ready to have your ears tenderly kissed and whispered into by the boys. Only cozy vibes allowed here. If you have uncozy vibes I DON'T WANT IT. Inopportune timing? Perhaps. But keep in mind there's quite a information delay between the earth and the moon so how were we supposed to know? This week the boys make tracks based around the color Red. Long time listeners might remember the Blue challenge from... idk like 4 weeks ago. This is like that but it's like, you know, it's a different color. Red and blue are two different colors is what I think I'm trying to say. They're both primary colors though. At least in the art color wheel. Hey can I ask you a question? Please promise to just keep it between the two of us but how the fuck does CMYK work?? The boys only had 3600 seconds to complete this open category challenge. Did they make anything good? Well, one of them did! To listen be sure to do a short backwards bunny hop in this corner on frame 8 which will instaflag the ending credits for this any% speedrun of podcasts. That's bass, not bass. In a throwback to the forbidden episode [Z.E.R.0.], the boys set out to make some banana bass bangers. But who's banana was a banger and who's was a bungle? That's up to Shane to decide. We've all been there. You're listening to an album, absolutely vibing, and then a skit track comes on. Or an instrumental interlude. And it doesn't even really fit thematically with the rest of the album. Feels  like padding. Or maybe it's a perfectly good song, but a completely different mood from the rest of the album. What do you do? You hit skip. We've all done it, it's okay. For the first time in history, Ryan and Ian have been mandated to use the same backing track for their mashup. I know some of you idiots out there are saying ""backing track mandates are unconstitutional"" but you're wrong. According to the Moon constitution, Shane can make us do whatever we want. We all signed it. That's just how we do it up here.  One of the core truths about making music is that typically you wanna hear what you're doing. But we didn't get to do that this week. Both tracks were made on mute. The results might surprise you though. Just like Beethoven, we don't need to listen to what we're doing to make masterpieces. Every once in a while you find yourself grooving along to a song. Tapping your toe, snapping your fingers, and then it happens. You get to the chorus, and it just blows. Like It's REAL bad and you aren't sure what happened or how you got here but you but as you scramble to pause it you get tangled up in your headphone cables because you can't afford airpods so you trip and the cable gets caught on the door knob and as your vision fades the last thing you hear is ""THE BISCUITS AND THE BEANS""";http://karmr.io, https://vimeo.com/506082746;

Launch of Judeo Spanish Songs from the EMI Archive Trust | EMI Archive Trust;"Navigation The EMI Archive Trust have the great pleasure to share an announcement from Prof. Edwin Serrossi, Director of the Jewish Music Research (JMR), for the results of this extraordinary multi-disciplinary collaboration project ‘Judeo–Spanish Songs from the EMI Archive Trust (1907-1912)’.  This entire project, including the 78 tracks is now open for listening on the Jewish Music Research website.  JMR invite you to join them and celebrate with some fascinating findings and music, first premiered 22 November 2020, hosted by Confederation House, the centre for ethnic music and poetry, as part of the International Oud Festival. Joanna Hughes  – Heritage Curator & Manager of Historic Collections, EMI Archive Trust The EMI Archive Trust holds a collection of great depth, full of incredible stories, some remain untold, these often require deep research and decoding to allow us and our partners to share their true cultural value, globally. The impressive forensic work carried out by Professor, Edwin Serrossi and his team in revealing these rare recordings was inspiring. Prof. Edwin Serrossi – Director of the Jewish Music Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. In 2008 the Jewish Music Research Centre released a 4 CD package entitled An Early 20th-century Sephardi Troubadour: The Historic Recordings of Haim Effendi of Turkey. Catering to the increasing scholarly and general public interest in the role commercial recordings had on musical traditions from the early twentieth century, that production became a landmark in the revised appreciation of Sephardic music prior to the rapid chain of events leading to the dissolution of the traditional communities that maintained this music. Although Haim Effendi dominated the playlist of Sephardic communities in terms of his proportional share of the market, he was by no means the only artist recorded.  For this reason, locating and releasing the rich repository of Judeo-Spanish recordings at the EMI Archive Trust, heir to the Gramophone and Zonophone companies, represents a further breakthrough in the study of the Sephardic song. This collection not only brings to light the forgotten voices of many Sephardic artists extremely popular a century and more ago, but also expands the geographical distribution of recordings to Ottoman Jewish centers beyond Constantinople/Istanbul. Moreover, the EMI collection includes recordings that preceded those of Haim Effendi, broadening the confines of the Ladino song repertoire known until now. The picture of the state of Sephardic music in the large urban centers of the Ottoman Empire ca. 1890-1914 is now more textured and varied thanks to these precious jewels from the EMI Archive Trust. This page presents the full 78 tracks selected for this project for listening, and the accompanying booklet, a scholarly effort of many years, as a free PDF download. In the future Eastern Mediterranean Judeo-Spanish Songs from the EMI Archive Trust (1907-1912) will be available for purchase as a CD package and/or download.’   Project Contributors:  Study and commentaries: Rivka Havassy and Edwin Seroussi Research collaborators: Michael Aylward, Joel Bresler, Judith R.

 Enrique Cámara de Landa (Catedrático en la Universidad de Valladolid) y Leonardo Díaz Collao (Doctor en Musicología por la Universidad de Valladolid) In this post, Enrique Cámara de Landa and Leonardo Díaz Collao explain the relevance of the second edition of their book on institutional and bibliographic resources for music research in the times of COVID-19. The authors compiled resources such as online journals, bibliographic databases, and sound and audiovisual digital archives from different world regions. The book is a guide for new or early-career Spanish-speakers music scholars, offering brief descriptions and hyperlinks to resources. Download the book here. La dificultad al acceso de materiales incrementada en los tiempos de la COVID-19 solo puede ser sorteada a través del uso combinado e ingenioso de los recursos institucionales y bibliográficos disponibles en línea. Nuestro manual puede ayudar a navegar en el ingente mar de recursos online disponibles para la investigación musical   Para conocerte mejor, Enrique Cámara de Landa y Leonardo Díaz Collao. A fines de 2020 se publicó la segunda edición del libro Para conocerte mejor. Recursos institucionales y bibliográficos para la investigación en música tradicional y popular, editada por la Sociedad de Etnomusicología (SIbE) con el apoyo del Aula de Música de la Universidad de Valladolid y perteneciente a la colección Instrumentos para la investigación musical. La elaboración de este documento estuvo motivada por la desorientación que enfrentan jóvenes investigadores frente a la inmensa y cambiante cantidad de recursos bibliográficos existentes y la carencia de manuales que faciliten la fase inicial de cualquier investigación musical. Con la crisis sanitaria que atravesamos, esta situación se vio acrecentada debido a dos factores: el permanente incremento de datos online y la imposibilidad de acceder presencialmente a archivos y bibliotecas. La recopilación de los materiales que incluimos en el texto, varios de ellos disponibles en línea, comenzó hace más de una década. Con nuestra publicación buscamos orientar la primera etapa de estudios etnomusicológicos de investigadores hispanohablantes para acceder a informaciones institucionales y −sobre todo− bibliográficas. Entre los recursos que incluimos en el manual figuran listados de revistas de investigación musical con contenidos online (muchos de libre acceso), descripciones de bases de datos bibliográficas (como por ejemplo DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals), sitios webs de archivos sonoros y audiovisuales de diferentes regiones del planeta y vaciados temáticos originales confeccionados por los autores. Estos últimos pueden ser consultados a través de hipervínculos y constituyen nuevas herramientas para la consulta bibliográfica, como, por ejemplo, el enlace que contiene los resúmenes en español de los artículos de los volúmenes del Yearbook for Traditional Music publicados desde 1961 hasta la actualidad y elaborados exclusivamente para nuestro manual. Dicha revista ha comenzado a incluir abstracts en la lengua original de los autores solo en sus volúmenes recientes. Como se puede ver en la siguiente imagen (página 62 del manual), bajo la descripción de la cada publicación se incluye, en un diseño de fácil acceso, el hipervínculo respectivo:   Example of hyperlink to the Yearbook for Traditional Music – Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council, page 62 of the Manual Sin duda, la gran cantidad de recursos incluida en este manual ha crecido de manera muy rápida, dado que en estos tiempos los materiales digitales y de acceso remoto no son solo un apoyo a la investigación sino una necesidad, en muchos casos, irremplazable. Nuestra recomendación, sobre todo a las y los investigadores noveles, es realizar una búsqueda estratégica que sepa utilizar la herramienta adecuada dependiendo del tipo de estudio que se desarrolle y del momento de la investigación en el que se encuentre. Cuando comencemos nuestra investigación convendrá consultar como primera medida diccionarios y enciclopedias (capítulo 1) para luego realizar una búsqueda amplia en bases de datos bibliográficas (capítulo 4) a través de palabras clave. Luego podrá complementarse el resultado de la búsqueda en índices con la revisión de revistas especializadas en el tema de nuestra investigación (capítulo 3) y mediante la consulta de antologías y compendios bibliográficos (capítulo 2). No podemos olvidar la importancia en nuestras disciplinas de los archivos sonoros y audiovisuales (capítulo 5). Además, conviene conocer los recursos disponibles en nuestras instituciones, así como las herramientas de acceso abierto. Consideramos que la dificultad al acceso de materiales incrementada en los tiempos de la COVID-19 solo puede ser sorteada a través del uso combinado e ingenioso de los recursos institucionales y bibliográficos disponibles en línea. Nuestro manual puede ayudar a navegar en el ingente mar de recursos online disponibles para la investigación musical a través de sus descripciones, listados, hipervínculos y vaciados selectivos.

10 Reasons Why Kids NEED Art & Music — Art and Music Center |  Lessons for all Ages;"Art and music are critical for our youth. Whether they are exposed to art and music in school or through private or community classes and lessons, the benefits are incredible. Art and music exposure does more than provide a creative outlet for kids; they provide mental, emotional, and educational benefits -- and more. Immersing children in music can help boost their brain power. Music stimulates the parts of the brain associated with academic achievement, such as reading and math, and emotional development. Instead of viewing music as an extracurricular activity, consider it an overall part of your child’s education.   Students involved in the arts have tremendous academic benefits compared to students without exposure to the arts. Art inspires kids to excel in and out of the classroom. It helps students stay in school, increases motivation, improves attitudes and attendance, and improves academic performance. According to Americans for the Arts, a student involved in the arts is: 4x more likely to be recognized for academic achievement. 4x more likely to participate in a math or science fair. 3x more likely to win an award for school attendance. 3x more likely to be elected to class office. Lower income or socioeconomic students experience even greater benefits from the arts. Low income students highly engaged in the arts are more than twice as likely to graduate compared to their peers with no arts education, and have a 5x lower dropout rate. Want your kids to remember their homework assignments, where they put their shoes, or to brush their teeth before bed? Music might help. Research has shown that participation in music at an early age can help improve memory. Exposing children to music in early development helps them learn word sounds and meanings, and dancing helps build motor skills. Even adults can experience memory benefits from just listening to music. This may sound like an obvious benefit, but the effects of enhanced creativity will extend to many aspects of your child’s life. Children develop innovation skills when they’re encouraged to express themselves and take risks in creating art and playing music. Those skills can open doors later in life; 72% of employers say that creativity is the #1 skill they look for when hiring. It’s not always team sports that teach important social skills; playing an instrument can help, too. Music groups and ensembles can help kids develop important life skills such as teamwork, developing leadership skills, discipline, and how to relate to others. Children’s brains develop faster with music, particularly in areas associated with language acquisition and reading skills, according to a 2016 study at the University of Southern California’s Brain and Creativity Institute. For young children, making arts provides opportunities for language development. Toddlers learn words for colors and shapes as they create art. If you want to encourage language learning, communication, and reading in your kids, art and music are essential. The creativity involved in art education strengthens critical thinking skills for kids. Visually learning through drawing, sculpting, and painting develops visual-spatial skills. This teaches kids how to interpret and use visual information. As for music, a study of 3-4 year olds learning to play piano scored significantly higher on spatial-temporal reasoning tests compared to those with no music instruction. Spatial-temporal reasoning is a precursor to logical thinking, abstract thinking, and problem solving needed for the brain to function in mathematics, engineering, and physics. As kids develop skills in art and music, and improve those skills through repetition and practice, they build confidence in themselves. Studies have shown that when children participate in arts activities with peers and provide criticism and praise to one another, the feedback they give to each other builds self respect. Immersion in art and music can foster a sense of cultural awareness in kids. As students interpret visual imagery from artists and learn about art history, it helps them understand the concept of cultural diversity. Seeing a different culture explored through a visual medium such as sculptures or paintings helps kids process information differently than reading about it in a text book. Learning about musical history and exploring different types of music can help kids connect with different cultures. Art and music help people feel more connected to one another, as well. Dedicating themselves to art and music teaches kids important concepts of discipline. While some kids may show a natural talent in one area or another, the truth is that ongoing commitment and practice is required to improve. By committing to stick with lessons and practicing outside of classrooms and lessons, kids learn discipline skills that will benefit them in many aspects of life. Immersing children in the arts and music, at home, through lessons, at school and in the community, provides undeniable benefits that will help them throughout their lives.

Sample Music Research Paper On Linkin Park – Living Things (2012) - Assignment Help | My Essay Homework;"Introduction: A Biography of Linkin Park             Linkin Park is one of America’s most popular contemporary rock bands. The band currently comprises of members Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, Dave Farrell, Rob Bourdon, and Joseph Hahn. Linkin Park recently lost its front man, Chester Bennington, who died on July 20, 2017 (Garratt et al. 242). Since the release of its breakout album, Hybrid Theory (2002), the band has enjoyed unrivaled success across the United States and beyond. Linkin Park is popular for having facilitated the smooth transition of the rock music genre from metal and electronica of the 1990s to the more modern alternative. Nonetheless, Linkin Park’s music incorporates a wide range of influences, including hip hop and contemporary pop and EDM. It is important to note that each of the band’s seven studio albums explores a different style of music, making their sounds diverse and worthy of commanding a huge fan-base. This partly explains Linkin Park’s success as arguably the most popular rock music band of the twenty-first century. In fact, having sold 68 million records worldwide, the band currently ranks as the bestselling music group of the twenty-first century (Garratt et al. 242).              Apart from the seven studio albums, all which have performed exceptionally well on local and international charts, the group has also released five live albums, two compilation albums, two remix albums, three soundtrack albums, as well as several extended plays, LPs, and singles (Garratt et al. 242). Cumulatively, Linkin Park has featured in up to 1500 songs (see attached discography). Out of 190 nominations, the band has secured 63 awards, including but not limited to: 5 American Music Awards, 2 Grammy Awards, 1 Billboard Music Award, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and 4 MTV Video Music Awards (Garratt et al. 242). Section 1: Album Specifics – Living Things (2012)             Linkin Park released their fifth studio album, Living Things, in 2012. The album stands out from the band’s earlier albums based on the fact that it incorporates most of the genres explored in the other albums. This album was extensively influenced by pop music, the genre that was wildly popular during this period in the timeline of music history. The influence of the pop genre is noticeable from the incorporation of Chester’s smooth vocals into mellow tunes, as maybe observed in the track Powerless. Similarly, it is also easy to recognize the influence of heavy metal on the album, apparent from the tracks Victimized and Lies Greed Misery. A touch of the electronic genre is also felt in the songs Lost in the Echo and In My Remains. As with several tracks in the 2008 album, Minutes to Midnight, which is heavily influenced by hip hop, the band incorporated Mike Shinoda’s rapping skills in various tracks, notably Until it Breaks, Burn it Down,and Lost in the Echo, making the hip hop influence on the album noteworthy. Although the album is influenced by a range of genres, it is primarily founded on hard rock, the signature genre of Linkin Park. Thus, all songs have a hard rock element, a factor that proves important in upholding the band’s identity.               Despite that the album is influenced by a wide range of genres, the songs are unified by a common theme. The songs are all based on a personal theme, with the artists exploring the different issues that people deal with at a personal level. For instance, the album’s last song, Powerless, talks about a soul who goes through a lot of trouble, having exposed its weakness to a friend who is guided by their selfish desires, ending up being powerless. Lost in the Echo, on the other hand, talks about broken promises, which leads the persona to let go off the person they confide in. Similarly, In My Remains talks about a broken heart. Unlike previous albums, particularly A Minute to Midnight, which explores a wide variety of themes, Living Things sticks to the common theme of personal matters, which also explains the name of the album.  Section 2: Four Songs from the Album             One of the songs in this album is Roads Untraveled. Not only does the song have powerful lyrics, in which the artists encourage the listener to let go off their dark pasts, the corresponding instrumentals enhance the song’s musical appeal. The song starts out with a mellow beat to accompany Mike Shinoda’s verse. Intensity of the beats is increased at the chorus, maintained through Chester Bennington’s second verse, and intensified again towards the end. The more one listens to Roads Untraveled, the more he discovers the uniqueness and depth of the song. Despite being only three minutes long, the song’s appealing nature makes it an ideal source of strength for someone struggling with the inability to let go off a difficult past.              Victimized is an even shorter song that runs for just1 minute 38 seconds. Much different from Roads Untraveled, Victimized is a fast-paced track that explores the persona’s unwillingness to falter in the face of victimization. This message is appropriately delivered with hard rock elements, which makes the sound catchy while giving it the right amount of aggression. The record is also modified with electrifying heavy metal elements, evident at the song’s climax towards the end. These aspects sum up to make the song complete and essential to the theme of the album.             Powerless is the other catchy and meaningful song from Linkin Park’s 2012 album. Powerless is also arguably the most popular song in the album. This song is the last on the list of songs in the album, but its popularity supersedes some of the other songs in the album for being the soundtrack for 2012 film, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.  The song’s music video, which features scenes from the film, was directed by the movie’s director, Timur Bekmambetov. The song was also used in the film’s closing credits. Other than its association with the film, Powerless is noteworthy for the manner it combines evocative lyrics performed by Chester Benningthon with lock-step beats, as well as a catchy guitar performance by Brad Delson, one of the band’s members. Nonetheless, it is the song’s piano-based production that initially captures the listener’s attention. In line with the theme of the album, this song suggests that the persona willingly showed loyalty, only for his devotion to be reciprocated with betrayal.             The fourth track chosen for this analysis is Castle of Glass. This song is remarkable for utilizing electronic elements, similar to those that dominate the band’s previous album, A Thousand Suns. In line with a review by Melinda Newman, the song’s instrumentals tend to borrow from country music, adding to the diversity of the album’s sound. Upon listening to this song, one understands that the band was indeed enthused to create an album with a wide range of influences. Considering that each of the band members is uniquely talented, so that every individual’s input contributes in increasing the diversity of their sounds, it is possible to understand why the band stated that Living Things was significant in creating a new identity for the band (Childers and Linkin Park 77). At the same time, listening to Castle of Glass captivates the listener to interpret the song’s message with a whole new understanding, considering that the song is produced with non-traditional electronic elements. On the one hand, the song talks about a broken soul, who has little worth in his society (only a crack in this castle of glass). On the other hand, the song is multi-leveled, containing diverse instrumentals and auto-tunes, so that it is unlikely for the listener to pay attention to the actual message communicated by the lyrics.  As such, the song succeeds at sustaining the album’s theme; while simultaneously adding to the unique sounds that add up to make this album a masterpiece by Linkin Park. Section 3: My Listening Experience for Linkin Park’s Living Things             I enjoyed listening to Linkin Park’s 2012 album. Being a Linkin Park fan who has had the chance to listen to most of their songs, I feel that Living Things represents the band’s progress, as well as their ability to evolve and adapt to the changing interests of their ever-increasing fan base. With Linkin Park having facilitated the transition of rock music from traditional genres like heavy metal to more modern styles like alternate rock, the group uses this album to provide listeners with an opportunity to experience diverse sounds of rock music, albeit with modern influences. I would recommend this album to every fan of rock music because it stays true to the foundational elements of hard rock music, in spite of the fact that Linkin Park has been under relentless pressure to shift to contemporary genres like EDM and pop music. In order to deal with the pressure, while staying true to their identity, as well as meeting the interest of their new-school listeners, the band ensured that the 2012 album borrowed the influence of multiple genres, including but not limited to EDM, pop, electronic, and country music. Considering that the album is inclusive of elements from other genres of music and that it has a personalized theme, I would also recommend it to lovers of music who have not had the chance to listen to rock music. Conclusion             Linkin Park has sustained its popularity as one of the most beloved rock bands of the twenty-first century by staying relevant. The band has achieved this by continually staying relevant through the years by releasing music that identifies with the interests of their ever-increasing fan base. The band has consistently ensured that their music evolves on a consistent basis. This is apparent from the content of Living Things, an album which borrows from the influence of multiple genres, while upholding the same personalized theme. While achieving these objectives, the album also succeeds at upholding the hard rock elements that proved useful in creating the band’s identity in the early 2000s. I would therefore recommend the album to all lovers of music who would like to delve into rock music.

The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads - Cognition Today;"Cognition Today

 Home » Social Psychology » The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads Picture this: A bunch of unique-looking headbanging people listening to heavy music; entering a whirlpool of human collision in front of their favorite artist; raising their fists in the air; raising the devil’s horns \m/. What is that all about? Who are they? These are the metalheads. What is their psychology?  We are going to look at the social psychology of heavy metal and rock music fans. In this article, I’ll review the scientific research done on their personality, their behavior, why they do what they do, what they get out it, etc. The effects of heavy metal music can be described through a social-music psychology lens. Let’s look through it.  Heavy metal has many connotations that relate to social psychology. I’ll highlight the most prominent ones here. These come from the heavy metal audience – the musicians as well as the fans.  Brotherhood, Rebellion, Honest Expression, Repression, Outsider, Anger and Aggression, Brutality, Conformity and Non-conformity, Isolation, Depression, Oneness, Homogeneity, Dissolving in the crowd, Respect and Victory, Sincerity and Discipline, Dramatization, and Authority.  These connotations signify something. Heavy metal music caters to some very fundamental feelings and experiences humans have in society. I’ve left out many more connotations that don’t help this post but feel free to take a moment and think. Some of them may contradict each other and that is because heavy metal has many different sub-genres (death metal, thrash metal, power metal, doom metal, etc.) which cater to certain aspects of human experiences.  Positive behavioral outcomes occur when the audience is a fan of metal music. Let’s find out what they are. Just like most other forms of music, people synchronize with each other. Heavy metal relates people to one another and gives existential meaning to many.  Even though people have considered rock music as the devil’s music and opined that this form of music creates negative outcomes like aggression, the story is not that simple. A longitudinal study shows that people who grew up in the 80s and 90s with metal as the popular culture lead healthy and fulfilling lives today. In fact, the research report says that they are better adjusted than non-fans and their metalhead identity serves as a protective barrier against negative life experiences. They also say that participation in fringe cultures can enhance identity development in troubled youth.  While there is a known analogy between bipolar disorders (alternating depression & mania) and heavy metal, there is no known cause-effect between the two. Songs might just reflect the human condition of bipolarity without a direct cause-effect relationship.  Researchers have found that people who are angry and aggressive can experience more positive emotions because of the increased arousal from metal music which matches the person’s physiological state. This congruence between anger/aggression and arousal from metal helps with anger regulation. The popular notion that heavy music makes one angry is not substantiated. In fact, listening to heavy metal may be a healthy way of processing anger.  Go headbang to Megadeth if you want to process anger constructively.  When we look at the stress-reducing capacity of music (as a coping mechanism), for non-fans, classical music and self-chosen music works better than a prescription of heavy metal.  A thesis based on case studies shows that listening to music (heavy metal included) helps people who have been traumatized. It helps them regulate their emotions, overcome suicidal thoughts, and occupy their sensory environment. Extreme forms of music give people a sense of relatability and shared communal support (death metal, doom metal) if they are predisposed to negative outcomes. For example, if someone is already experiencing harsh realities (survival issues, self-harm, abuse) the underlying themes in extreme metal which resonate with those realities provide a sense of relief.  Wait… So far, it looks like metal music is a bed of roses, but it might just be a bed of razors. Research on metal music has one deadly finding to showcase.  Metal music can induce serious amounts of negative emotions and predatory instincts in mice while solving a maze. Mice listening to hard rock music ended up killing each other. While mice who listened to Mozart did not kill each other. Mice who listened to heavier music also took more time solving the maze than mice who listen to classical or no music. The auditory stress of rock music might have pushed the mice into a frenzy. Read about it here: Educational CyberPlayGround.  Humans have an ethics-based guiding system in the brain which makes sure that the strong negative emotional states evoked by metal do not translate into such aggressive behavior as that in mice; at least in well-adjusted humans. Severe personality, mood, and psychotic disorders change the picture completely, and the reactions may not be favorable. It is possible that complex metal music cannot be properly processed by mice and is interpreted as a stressor & a threat.  On similar lines, one study by a road-safety authority found that listening to Slipknot’s (sic) can be detrimental to driving. They explain this as an effect of compromised attention.  I did speak of metal music as a way to combat negative emotions and cope with them, even reduce aggressive tendencies. However, this effect appears to be more in fans than in non-fans. Those who don’t prefer high-intensity metal music have an increase in uneasiness after listening but fans appear to have an increase in positive emotions after listening.  This begs the question – How do other music genres fare in emotion regulation? Emotion regulation is about managing and modifying emotions fruitfully. One paper addressed this question. They found that rock music and heavy metal music is potent for managing negative moods. Jazz, Blues, Classical, Rap, Hip-Hop, Soul, Funk, and Electronic/Dance are potent in both negative and positive mood regulation. While the genre classification is crude in this study, they analyzed broad dimensions of music. They provide evidence for rhythm and energy being the two critical factors in regulating emotions.  A study on the link between mental health and metal fans from France shows that the baseline rates of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicide) are similar to those of the general population; sometimes, even lower. One explanation for this is the power of emotional regulation via metal and the sense of community that comes with the fandom. This is in direct contradiction with the general perception that metalheads are more mentally unstable.  Metal and rock music is diverse with many sub-cultures which have certain characteristics, these characteristics may play a role in explaining some observations of deteriorating mental health. For example, a study found evidence that teens who are heavily associated with a goth sub-culture are at a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Although the link was present, the study doesn’t dish out whether at-risk teens prefer a goth sub-culture or the goth-culture normalizes this behavior. Fun fact: An interesting physics-chemistry-music cross-over study showed that people in a mosh-pit behave like molecules of a gas. Where the act of bumping into one other in a pseudo-random way resembles the mathematical structure of the molecules in a gas. You can read about its implications here: Mosh pit physics could aid disaster planning.  Because the audience is small and the person who likes metal does so at a very personal level, you’ll see that a huge number of metal fans are musicians themselves. Apart from the sound of ‘metal’ being an acquired taste for many, being a musician further bolsters the connotations I mentioned at the start of this post.  A survey-based research study on 414 British undergraduates showed that those who liked metal music tended to be more open to experiences, wanted to be unique, and were not in favor of authority. While this isn’t groundbreaking research, it corroborates people’s narratives about why they like metal.  You might be surprised by how metal music relates to romantic relationships. If your significant other sports a Judas Priest teeshirt, chances are he/she is not going to cheat on you as much as someone sporting jazz music teeshirts. A survey study showed that metalheads were least likely to cheat on their partner and jazz fans were most likely to cheat. Turns out, metalheads are loyal and faithful people. As per musical preferences and lifestyle preferences analyzed in this paper, rock music (not metal, data lacking) fans tend to have fewer sexual partners than fans of dance, house, hip-hop, rap, jazz, and indie music. A whopping 93.5% of metalheads had lesser than 5 sexual partners over a 5-year span.  But doesn’t this romantic faithfulness contradict the very essence of a lot of metal music? After all, metal music has the connotations of defiance, rebellion, and a dislike toward law and authority. Cheating is defined as breaking mutually accepted rules. So it looks like metalheads don’t see romance in a social context that has a governing system that dictates rules. One could speculate that romance/love, for metalheads, is deeply personal and asocial. The mutual rules in romance depend only on the partner(s).  There is this lingering question that many have in mind- Do violent & angry themes in music make a person violent? A study explored this question by testing positive & negative emotions and awareness of violent themes on their mental processing of music. They found that violent music does partially desensitize a person depending on how much they like the music. Non-fans showed an increased negativity bias – selective processing of negative information. This shows that non-fans did amplify the processing of violent themes. Fans did not have this bias in spite of being aware of the violent themes. This is probably due to a) Liking the music, b) Long-term exposure, and c) Evaluating the musical experience as positive.  Heavy metal music is intricate. It is based on the acquisition of skills that take a long time to get refined. It’s a genre that clearly evolved from simple to complex musical structures; mostly bound by guitars, vocals, drums, keyboards, and bass. That is just the nature of natural selection applied to music. When a metal musician makes music, it is the result of years of practice. That entails the discipline of studying, focusing on complicated sounds, sweating, and creating something new. Simply because the musician is involved in such mental and physical activity which costs a lot and often does not yield much monetarily, the musician attaches feelings of ‘sacrifice’ to it. This increases the sense of accomplishment felt by the musician.  I can only imagine that such a routine makes hard-working, sincere, and creative people who are proud of their struggle to make something interesting with music. One important factor is the feedback loop between music and the self. Making structured music will start making the musician structure other things in life. A showy guitarist will most likely be flashy in other parts of his or her life. A person who generally listens to a variety of things would be open-minded in other factors. Whereas an extremely fussy musician will also tend to be fussy about the food he/she eats. These are some likely examples, they are not generalizations.  Metal musicians often make music with other musicians. This is a form of ‘coupling’ or synchronized behavior. Songs sound like songs because of this inherent quality of coupling. Random sounds do not sound like music because they lack coupling. In fact, this coupling is popularly understood as the chemistry between musicians. A study showed how the brains of guitarists who are playing together synchronize their brain waves before the music begins, thereby supporting the idea of this intuitive coupling. Read about it here. When coupled, fans and musicians experience similar emotional states which foster bonding through dedicated systems. These dedicated systems are interesting meta-networks of neurons that fire in a way that mirrors (for lack of a better word) someone else’s behavioral, cognitive, and emotional state. They are associated with observation, mimicking, synchronizing, and understanding different perspectives. They also foster nurturing and companionship which is required for pair-bonding. This musical coupling is likely to make a person more sensitive and empathetic. I’m not talking about mirror neurons, I’m talking about a dozen other networks which explain similar functions in humans.  One research study suggests that the metal ‘gig’ ritual (headbanging included) allows musicians to go in a state of flow. The very act of playing along with a band on stage made a musician more likely to experience flow. Taking a step backward, flow is the mental state where one is completely absorbed in a task and feels one with it. Flow is a positive desirable state because it is connoted by task engagement, a deep connection with the task, intrinsic satisfaction, challenge, and joy.  The curiously interesting bit is that the musicians experience flow in spite of the deeply embedded negative emotional states like anger, frustration, and rebellion in metal music. You can read more about the flow state and how to achieve it here. There certainly are pros and cons observed in heavy metal music-making and listening. And that’s hardly a problem – career difficulties, community building, in-group & out-group aggression, etc. are a part of many sects. You look at any sub-section of society – there will be extreme outliers, quirks, pros, and cons. That’s a discussion more suited to the human condition on the whole than on any form of music.  General life stories of heavy metal fans show:1. Significant emotional depth is added to like-mindedness in music2. There is a phase in their lives where metal music added meaning to their ‘not so pleasant lives.’ 3. Metal becomes an integral part of their lives and the related attitudes and behavior are seen across many facets of their lives including relationships, school, parenthood, etc. These are the reasons metalheads get obsessive about their music as well. Which, sometimes, is unhealthy as they could become dogmatic and disrespectful toward music which isn’t their own.  Although this isn’t a tested hypothesis, I would say that metal music makes people behave in a collective way largely because it is a minority. This is similar to a phenomenon in evolutionary biology called negative frequency-dependent selection. In simple terms, the value of heavy metal is high because of its relatively low frequency in the whole population. That is, heavy metal fans are a minority and heavy metal music is more valuable because it is rare as opposed to pop music – which is, by definition, popular and abundant.  People may slightly overestimate its effects and be biased due to the music being relatively rare. It’s like seeing a person you know in a foreign country, you end up evaluating that person in a more favorable way. Metal music itself is democratic within this minority, fans become musicians and vice-versa. They maintain the genre & subculture by assuming at least one of the two roles. That is why you can say that heavy metal is of the people, by the same people, and for the same people. For those about to rock, we salute you! There is one last thing I’d like to introduce. When you look at a lot of sub-genres of music, the various emotions associated with each sub-genre, and the musical complexity, there is an overarching theme that emerges. This theme is about how metal music evolves alongside people, culture, science, art, technology, and the environment.  The theme has multiple feedback loops & transfer effects – thinking about science could be informed by musical complexity, socio-cultural nuances of metal could inform technological advancement, metal could foster newer public sentiments such as concern for climate change, etc. You can read this paper to know more about the holistic bird’s eye view of how metal music interacts with the human condition.  \m/  Hey!

 Great article Aditya, I really enjoyed reading it. The themes in your paper cover something that I have been thinking about for a while (I have an Art Therapy background and work with children with emotional and behavioural problems) about the psycho-emotional aspects to listening to metal and anger/emotion regulation. I have always dreamed of doing a Quantitative study on it amongst friends hah! Your section on flow catches what my own experiences are with listening to metal music, particularly with lyrics that tap into a certain emotionally charged memory (I’m a massive TOOL fan, as well as Deftones, Mastodon and Messhugah XD). Personally I would definitely support the thesis that listening to music with negative-emotion themes helps process and deal with difficult experiences. Catharsis, similar to the Art Therapy process of pouring and mess-making is very present in Metal music to me.
Again I would say the concept of flow as either an active player or listener at a gig/in-headphones was at times a spiritual experience, like BHarath is saying above, and I think of it as being taken out of your mind and body by the sound and having a feeling of great release at those moments, when certain riffs or lyrical content hits the right nerve. Anyway, great article, thank you very much for posting! Hey Alistair, thank you so much for appreciating my article and sharing your experience! I’m delighted to hear you also think negatively charged themes can help with regulation! Regarding the parallel between mess-making and so-called “noise-making” actually has so much value. Probably not just in regulation & catharsis, but also in creative exploration and accidental discoveries. Certainly, feeling “flow” while listening and/or playing is quite powerful. I personally enjoy listening flow more than playing flow, particularly when I am in an exploratory zone. That complete engagement of your senses when all else drowns out is amazing. Its a Gate way to spirituality (Don’t mistake it for religious) – Spirituality in understanding the oneself (U) so that you could understand everything else.
The Stigma of Metal being Evil or the Devils Music is bullshit – In India Its hard to find one True Metal head (Fan or performer) – Who has the complete understanding of the above and who ha the richness with humility kind of notion. I have literally not met one – and i doubt i would find any; In India, these so called metal heads are either – fools or stupid enough to think they are the best – because of the weird look, (In a way, attraction) a wasted talent, which is called Music; never used with a purpose rather used to show off. Stupid competition of feeling great by stamping an innocent or week. Feeling special for smoking up. Lol.
WHo has no respect for his own culture but curiously and clueless running behind a culture with ZERO wisdom  I have not found one solid Metal head in India. All are so fake – that they can say; they have never heard Bollywood music, MC** are you serious – how much would anyone fake. Just a trying copy of the one already existing.  DOn’t respond to this if you want to prove coz you will never succeed, As an Example – The Indian Heavy Metal Music itself is your answer. It has always been a copy and never authentic … A*** Holes all of them ..  DO you know something – A Character like Bhagath, Bismil, Azad, I am sure if they knew heavy metal existed – They would have been the one.

Hey, thank you so much for thinking about donation, really appreciate your sentiment:) I do have a donate button in the footer section! I’m a 40-year-old Heavy Metal musician and this article basically explains everything that has been going on in my mind since I was 13. If I had to comment on every point and expand it, I could write a book, so I’ll stick to one issue: The apparent contradiction with romantic faithfulness and rebellion. I have always been faithful in relationships, and a rebel all my life. Here’s why: 1. Faithfulness is not about obedience, but loyalty. And while we hate obeying rules, we love loyalty. It’s actually rewarded in the culture (at least it was in my country Malta’s, metal scene)
2. Being a “Metal couple” is in itself an act of rebellion. Though nowadays I’m much more into the music than the fashion, I remember being young and feeling proud that my girlfriend wore studs and Type O Negative t-shirts.
3. The passion for metal, makes the relationship stronger. When I had non-metal girlfriends there were times we ended up talking about the weather. With metal girlfriends, we only talked about the weather if a storm was coming and there was an open-air gig. When you’re young, and you don’t have kids, the passion for metal could be near as bonding as bringing up a child. Thanks for commenting Robert:D The 3 reasons you gave – spot on! Loyalty is a very different concept for us and is completely different from rebellion. I see it rewarded in the Indian metal scene too. I am not really in the scene anymore but can confirm point 2 and 3 anecdotally.  The passion gave me a new way of life after a dull and boring school life!";https://cognitiontoday.com/the-social-psychology-of-heavy-metal-rock-music-research-on-metalheads?fbclid=IwAR1-4HHg_J1G7Q0BjD2ye1yoMNpImIkPAoktZZoCc2qEJZxTZnKyxjmfRbI;
What She Said: Opera’s Stories About Women Are Stuck in Another Age. But Change Is Underway.;"By Jennifer Cresswell and Kathleen Kelly Opera’s got a woman problem. Now, we love opera, make no mistake! But as women, particularly women in mid-life, it’s rare to see our lives reflected meaningfully on stage. We’ve concluded that this is largely a repertoire problem.  And in true Middleclass Artist fashion, we’ve got some data to show why.  So, just like our inquisitive sister Turandot, we’re going to start this party off with three questions - but these questions were first posed by a woman named Alison Bechdel.  You probably know Alison Bechdel as the brilliant storyteller behind the Broadway smash Fun Home. Well, back in 1985, she was penning the comic Dykes to Watch Out For. In a strip called “The Rule,” the characters were discussing movies, and posed a “test” of three questions.  Question 1. Are there two women in the movie with actual names? Question 2. Do they talk to each other? And question 3. Do they have a conversation about something other than a man? Think about some of your favorite movies. Do they pass all parts of the test? Any part? How do movies measure up in general? Well, Alison Bechdel fans have been doing their homework because currently there are 8574 movies in the database at http://bechdeltest.com/  Of those: 11% don’t pass any part of the test - there aren’t two named female characters.  22% pass part one of the test 10% pass parts one and two of the test 57% pass the complete Bechdel test We got curious about how opera would do. Now, we didn’t research 8574 titles, but we did look at the top 50 most played titles in the United States between 2010 and 2019, according to Operabase. What are they, you ask? Voila:   La boheme, Carmen, La traviata, Madama Butterfly, Tosca, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Die Zauberflöte, Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro, Rigoletto, Cosi fan tutte, Lucia di Lammermoor, Aida, Turandot, Pagliacci, Hansel und Gretel, Die Fledermaus, Romeo et Juliette, Il trovatore, L’elisir d’amore, La Cenerentola, Les Pecheurs de perles, Don Pasquale, Yevgeny Onegin, Faust, Les contes d’Hoffmann, La FIlle du Regiment, Der fliegende Holländer, Falstaff, Porgy and Bess, Candide, The Pirates of Penzance, Ariadne auf Naxos, Macbeth, Norma, Nabucco, Otello, Gianni Schicchi, Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Die lustige Witwe, The Mikado, Fidelio, La fanciulla del West, Salome, Orfeo ed Euridice, Un ballo in maschera, Suor Angelica, L’italiana in Algieri, Don Carlo, and Cavalleria Rusticana. How did they do with the test? Well, five operas on this list don’t even have two women with their own names. This means 45 do, and so they pass question one. In 38 of those 45, the women with names speak to each other. And in ten of those operas, they speak about something other than a man.  In other words, of these fifty titles, seven operas pass Bechdel part one only, 28 operas make it to part two, and ten operas make it to part three. Talking percentages: 10% of the operas pass no part of the test  14% of the operas pass Bechdel part one  56% of the operas pass Bechdel parts one and two 20% of the operas pass the complete test  You can’t compare those percentages to the Hollywood percentages since the sample size is so different. But it sure looks like opera’s not doing great in having stories involving two women, with their own names, having any conversation that doesn’t center on a man. It’s not a super high bar to clear.  (I mean, we’re women. We talk about...a lot of things.) But surely this situation in opera is changing, right? There’s an explosion of new composition, significant institutional support for it, and all in the wake of the #Metoo movement?  We decided to see what would happen if we restricted our search to the top fifty most frequently performed operas in the US from 2016-2019. That search added eight works to our list: Moby Dick, Dead Man Walking, As One, Das Rheingold, Silent Night, Maria de Buenos Aires, Rusalka, and Glory Denied, which displaced Turandot, Don Carlo, L’italiana, Un ballo in maschera, The Mikado, Macbeth, Otello, and Merry Widow. Of those eight new operas on our more recent list, two are still from the 19th century, Rheingold and Rusalka. But how do these eight do with the Bechdel test? There are not two named women in either Moby Dick or Maria de Buenos Aires. Glory Denied and As One are both operas in which two singers play a single woman character. In Silent Night, the two named women characters, the only two women in the opera, do not talk to each other. Only in Dead Man Walking and Rheingold do the named women characters speak of something other than men.  This art form we love still gives the majority of its stage time to stories in which the plots and perspectives, as well as most of women’s words, center on men. This presents some real problems for women entering the field. (See: “A Study of Systemic Discrimination Against Women in Opera” by Zach Finkelstein, Dana Lynne Varga, and Hillary LaBonte. The authors lay out a strong case for how severely disadvantaged women are in the field of opera due to factors including fewer roles, a greater gulf between supporting and leading roles, and many more women than men entering the field.)  Building on that, let’s turn this math in the direction of another important factor.  Right now, we’re experiencing a renaissance of opera composition in the US. It’s a thrilling time to be involved with the art form. But when you look again at that list of the USA’s fifty most frequently performed operas of the last ten years, contemporary composition hasn’t made a dent. Exactly one opera on that list, Candide, was composed after 1950. Look at how many operas on the list were composed after 1910 (making them less than a century old relative to our sample list of fifty, beginning in 2010): Turandot, Porgy and Bess, Candide, Ariadne auf Naxos, Gianni Schicchi, Suor Angelica, and Fanciulla. Only seven of the fifty.  (And of those seven, four are by one composer, Puccini. The dude could write, but come on.) More significant is that forty out of the fifty - eighty percent! - were composed before 1900. And of those, twenty-seven of them (La boheme, Carmen, La traviata, Tosca, Rigoletto, Aida, Pagliacci, Hansel und Gretel, Die Fledermaus, Romeo et Juliette, Il trovatore, Les Pecheurs de perles, Don Pasquale, Yevgeny Onegin, Faust, Les contes d’Hoffmann, La Fille du Regiment, Der fliegende Holländer, Falstaff, The Pirates of Penzance, Nabucco, Cavalleria Rusticana, Otello, Don Carlo, Ballo, The Mikado, and Macbeth) were written between 1837 and 1901, the years of Queen Victoria’s reign. Read that again: of the fifty most frequently performed operas in the USA in the last decade, more than half (54%) were written during the Victorian Era. Even when we switch to our list from the last four years, twenty-four of the fifty (48%) are Victorian.  What was different on stage back then? Oh, just...everything. We talk a lot about how television and film have impacted opera, but when we say “opera,” we are largely talking about a theatrical aesthetic that hasn’t existed in many years. Acting techniques were different in the nineteenth century. What audiences saw and experienced as expressive was very different from what we see and experience.  No doubt, we can and are still touched and transported by these works as we are by many theatrical works from other centuries. The difference lies in the fact that musical compositions are, well...composed. Singers don’t have the same range of flexibility in their choices as actors do; they can’t freely change up pacing, pitch, and dynamic. Ethan Hawke can deliver Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy in a half-whisper, but a baritone Hamlet doesn’t have similar leeway while singing “O vin, dissipe la tristesse”. Put that together with the gender specifics of nineteenth-century theater and their modes of expression through the music of that time, and you can start to see how this seriously limits casting possibilities today.    For example, a soprano who wants to play the operatic ingenues on our list of fifty will need to conform to precise, century-old vocal expectations of femininity and innocence. She must have clarity and sweetness of tone, ability to float vulnerable high notes, and easy flexibility. Combine that with our art form’s emphasis on tradition, and you don’t end up with a whole variety of acceptable ways to sing Pamina (beautiful as each rendition may be, the sameness is as remarkable as the variation).  Movies and television now provide a variety of ingenues - varieties of looks, varieties of attitudes - but opera’s most popular ingenues are caught inside their compositions, inside a specific idea of what youth and vulnerability SOUND like.  Aging also has a particular sound on the opera stage. Older women characters in our fifty operas are almost invariably mezzo-sopranos. Looking back at our list, slightly less than half of the operas (48%) contain roles for older women at all. Of those, only four provide opportunities for sopranos to portray the older characters (Hansel and Gretel, Porgy and Bess, Gianni Schicchi, the Merry Widow).  What about secondary roles, where casting is often more flexible? Well, since men have more secondary parts available to them, in which tradition is less of a limiting factor in their casting, it means they have a much better chance to be cast in more parts - a better chance to stay employed, to learn and practice their craft. Let’s take just the top twenty operas from our list of fifty. A budding Tamino or Alfredo, for example, has a host of potential sidekick tenor parts: Gastone, Borsa, Goro, Basilio, Remendado, Spoletta, Basilio, Curzio, Tybalt, Normanno, the Messenger, Pang or Pong, Beppe, Alfred or Doktor Blind, or Ruiz. But his counterpart, a young Pamina or Violetta, finds secondary parts thin on the ground: Frasquita, First Lady or Papagena, Barbarina, the Priestess, and Gianetta. And of those six parts for soprano, two-thirds of them - Frasquita, First Lady, Papagena, and Barbarina - have precise vocal and age requirements and traditionally expected vocal qualities, while the same can’t be said for most of the listed tenor roles. Even “character tenor” parts are often cast with promising lyric young artists across the US. There are no equivalent “character soprano” parts. The vocal stereotyping of the pre-nineteenth century operas is caught up with the theatrical conventions of the time, affecting singers of all genders and voice types - the ardent tenor, the angry baritone, the fragile soprano, the heroic soprano, the sexy mezzo, the low-voiced old woman, and the fatherly bass. As much as repertoire from this era might still speak to us, those stereotypes are limiting, especially when we’re working toward greater inclusivity of casting, and toward a broad approach to retelling old stories. If the same heavily gendered vocal stereotypes of past repertoire are always at play, how far can we get with inclusivity of casting?  This is just one part of the wider discussion of equity in the opera industry, and can’t be had in a vacuum apart from other discussions involving, for example, racial biases or issues of gender expression. Our focus in this article on how operatic repertoire and operatic tradition affect women is a narrow one, to discuss how we came to create an opera together, and is by no means meant to be a complete commentary on the DEI problems in the industry.  Our whole community is engaging with issues of equity, inclusion, diversity, and fairness, and this article is a small part of that big mosaic.  Okay, just a little more math. We have, you could say, a story problem. Based on numbers of performances in 2019 worldwide, the top ten most frequently performed operas were: La traviata Carmen La boheme Don Giovanni Rigoletto Il barbiere di Siviglia Die Zauberflöte  Madama Butterfly Le nozze di Figaro Tosca A quick look at the top 10 operas by some key themes: Seven of the top ten operas depict violence against women, and half depict attempted rape or kidnapping of a woman. Eight of the ten set their stories within a society rigidly divided by class.  It’s an enlightening exercise to compare that list to this year’s sordid headlines. Stories of sexual slavery and gender-based violence are awful, but also not new. Alongside the great strides that women have fought for and achieved in our lifetime, these old practices continue unabated. Isn’t opera, with its outsized, huge-voiced emotions, a wonderful medium for these enormous, heartbreaking topics? And isn’t the operatic stage a place for women to amass incredible amounts of fame, fortune, and influence through singing these roles?  Absolutely yes. If women are on stage telling women’s stories, that in itself is important – a powerful voice, wielded by a queen onstage, speaks for itself, inspires and uplifts. That’s worth a lot. So many of opera’s stories hinge on the misuse of women, but that’s a part of human reality. Women have been bought and sold and attacked and murdered, and that’s part of what we should see on stage because it’s part of who we are. But these particular stories come to us from another era. It’s possible that classical vocal music’s sumptuous rendering of brutal stories might keep our engagement on a sentimental level, providing a pleasurable but superficial catharsis that lets us off the hook, avoiding the darker aspects of the stories, and of our own reality.  The real Violetta Valery of La Traviata, Alphonsine Plessis, grew up in a household so violent that her mother escaped with her two daughters and went into hiding. The first time Alphonsine’s father tried to sell her to a man, she was eleven. Eventually, she was sold to a seventy-year-old, taken to Paris, and soon found that the work she’d become famous for paid better than any other job a young girl could have. The toast of the demimonde was dead at 23. But when we meet Violetta, it’s in the big white ball gown or the famous Willy Decker red dress, at the top of her fame, singing about freedom. When Butterfly on stage tells us she is fifteen years old, the old industry joke is to roll your eyes and say, that diva doesn’t look fifteen to me. And these are both operas that PASS the Bechdel test. They’re beautiful, and heartbreaking, and provide an amazing opportunity for the women that sing them, but they also leave out enormous parts of a real story, human trafficking, that impacts women worldwide.  That’s part of opera’s woman problem as well.  From our vantage point today, we see clearly that all women singers need more roles, roles of a greater vocal variety, and roles that encompass a wider variety of women’s stories. In this question, as in all others, representation matters. Diversity on stage starts with diverse creators. Even in our 2016-2019 list of fifty operas, only two involved women as part of the creative team - Candide and As One. If women are at the center of storytelling, from our perspectives, diversity of expression will increase.  It’s so good to finally see widespread support for women’s voices truly taking hold. And as that happens, women with different dimensions are beginning to appear on our stages. Sex and size and power are beginning to sound and look different than in those Victorian tales. For example, this spring we'll be premiering a new chamber opera created by a team of three women; INTERSTATE. After performing a recital together in 2019, we decided that we wanted to take more ownership of the women's stories told on stage. We co-wrote a libretto and reached out to Kamala Sankaram, and a plan was made. INTERSTATE is inspired by the real-life friendship between serial killer Aileen Wuornos and her childhood friend. After being sentenced to death row for murdering seven men, the two women rekindled their friendship and exchanged letters for over a decade until Aileen's execution. Neither woman is young or glamorous; there is no thinly veiled romance to gloss over the reality of the situation. This piece also breaks many traditional boundaries of the singer and pianist relationship. In the spirit of true collaboration, the pianist is given equal dramatic weight and engages in spoken dialogue throughout the piece.  INTERSTATE is just one example of work that gives voice to women characters and performers who exist outside the boundaries of Victorian operatic archetypes. As we prepare for its workshop premiere in March, and as we notice the growing institutional support for new work and new stories, we’re encouraged.  Opera has focused so much energy on preserving past glories, and we hope that these glories continue. We want to hear our sister Turandot ask her three questions, we want the Valkyries to keep riding, and we want Susanna to once again outwit the whole Almaviva estate. But we also want to hear the words and see the stories of our own time, colored by the emotions and voices and sensibilities of our own world. If opera is truly aimed toward that future, we have reason to take heart.

On April 1994 in New York city, I introduced subharmonics as a musical element to extend the violin's range by a full octave below the open G string without changing the tuning. Since then, I am now able to play not only an octave below, but also almost all the chromatic intervals below the fundamental notes by applying different amount of bow pressure (Kimura, 1997). This article explains the empirical data and elements for producing subharmonics including bow location and pressure on the string and the age of strings. This article also introduces a curious method; it was found that a ''twisted'' string works better. These different subharmonics for string players will also afford composers broader possibilities in creating their works. This article is also accompanied by sound examples, as well as excerpts from my compositions using subharmonics. People also read lists articles that other readers of this article have read.

Music Research Seminar: Dr Anna Bull | Seminars | Music | The University of Aberdeen;"Or Browse: This is a past event 'Getting it right' Classical Music as a Middle-Class Social Practice In this talk, I draw on my recently published book, ‘Class, Control, and Classical Music’ (Oxford University Press, 2019), to discuss why, in the UK, classical music remains predominantly played by white middle-class people. I draw on data from an ethnographic study with young people playing in classical music ensembles in the south of England to explain how the inclusions and exclusions that are visible today were set up historically in the establishment of music education institutions in the late Victoria period. The link between class and classical music is also apparent in the ways in which classical music indexes middle-class respectability for young women; and in the social relations of classical music pedagogy, such as what I am calling a ‘pedagogy of correction’. These social relations are not, I argue, separate from the music itself, but are in part formed by the demands of classical music’s distinctive aesthetic, repertoire, and instruments. These demands create an aesthetic ideal of ‘getting it right’. This means that in order to change the demographic patterns of who plays classical music, the aesthetic itself will need to change. Dr Anna Bull is a Senior Lecturer in sociology at the University of Portsmouth. Her research interests include class and gender inequalities in classical music education; and staff sexual misconduct in higher education. Anna has published in leading sociology and music education journals and her monograph Class, Control, and Classical music, looking at the culture of classical music among young middle-class classical musicians in the south of England, was published in 2019 by Oxford University Press, and in 2020 was joint winner of the Philip Abrams Memorial Prize from the British Sociological Association. Anna is also a director of The 1752 Group (https://1752group.com/), a research and campaigning organisation working to address staff sexual misconduct in higher education.

Celebrate Women’s History Month with Music Research Guides | In The Muse: Performing Arts Blog;"Women’s History Month is filled with blog posts, articles, and public programs dedicated to the celebration and recognition of women’s contributions to society. The Music Division is happy to promote the following research guides on women in music, some of which were recently published just in time for Women’s History Month. Portrait of Eleanor Everest Freer. Bain News Service Photograph Collection, Prints & Photographs Division, Library of Congress. LC-B2- 6145-9 [P&P].American Women: Resources from the Performing Arts Collections highlights collections and resources in the Music Division that document the lives and works of significant women in music, theater, and dance. Learn about specific women who made headlines in jazz, opera, concert halls, the stage, and film; or, study the depiction of women in sheet music cover art from a specific time period. The guide provides search strategies for navigating the over 25 million items in the Music Division’s collections, along with links to digitized content that will satisfy any number of needs for the researcher interested in the history of women in the performing arts. Portrait of Eleanor Everest Freer. Bain News Service Photograph Collection, Prints & Photographs Division, Library of Congress. LC-B2- 6145-9 [P&P]. Eleanor Everest Freer: A Guide to Resources provides resources to research the life and work of American composer Eleanor Everest Freer (1864-1942), an advocate for American opera as well as a skilled singer and composer. Freer studied voice and composition in Paris at 20 years old and, upon her return to the United States, taught voice at the National Conservatory of the United States in New York during Dvorak’s tenure as head of the conservatory. She was the founder of the American Opera Society of Chicago, a society that established the David Bispham Memorial Medal Award for American opera composers who created works on an American subject. Freer herself composed 11 operas, including Little Women, A Legend of Spain, The Masque of Pandora, and The Legend of the Piper (which won the Bispham medal). Many of Freer’s holograph manuscripts are in the Music Division of the Library of Congress. Gena Branscombe: A Guide to Resources provides resources to research the life and work of American composer Gena Branscombe (1881-1977), who was well-known for her art songs, choral, piano, and chamber music. At 16 years old, Branscombe entered the Chicago Musical College to study piano and composition and, within a few year, won gold medals for original works. She taught in Chicago and then at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but left to study composition with Engelbert Humperdinck in Berlin. After marrying in 1910, Branscombe moved to New York City where she simultaneously pursued a career while having four daughters within five years. Branscombe was a choral conductor, a composer, a writer, and the founder of the Branscombe Choral (formerly the American Women’s Association Choral). Her compositional output includes some 150 art songs, piano and chamber music, a few orchestral works, and a large body of choral pieces. Photograph shows composers (from left to right) Phyllis Fergus (1887-1964), Ethel Glenn Hier (1889-1971), Amy Beach (1867-1944), Harriet Ware (1878-1972), and Gena Branscombe (1881-1977) in McPherson Square, Washington, D.C. in 1924. National Photo Company Collection, Prints & Photographs Division, Library of Congress. LC-F81- 30175 [P&P].Last, but certainly not least, Amy Beach: A Guide to Primary and Secondary Resources at the Library of Congress provides an overview to the print, manuscript, and digital collections in the Library’s Music Division related to the career and music of Amy Beach (1867-1944), the first American woman to achieve widespread recognition as a composer of large-scale works with orchestra. Beach’s notable works include her Mass in E-flat, “Gaelic Symphony,” Piano Concerto, and many art songs. While the Library of Congress does not hold a single, named “Amy Beach Collection,” the Music Division holds substantial material of interest for the Beach researcher, from music manuscripts and published scores, to printed writings, to correspondence to and from the composer, and more. Photograph shows composers (from left to right) Phyllis Fergus (1887-1964), Ethel Glenn Hier (1889-1971), Amy Beach (1867-1944), Harriet Ware (1878-1972), and Gena Branscombe (1881-1977) in McPherson Square, Washington, D.C. in 1924.

Lone musicians to play with virtual ‘timing-sensitive’ colleagues in a new immersive rehearsal platform - WMG :: News;"Show all news items




                Lone musicians to play with virtual ‘timing-sensitive’ colleagues in a new immersive rehearsal platform
        

A system that will enable musicians to play alone, but as if part of a live ensemble, is being developed by researchers from WMG, University of Warwick, led by the University of Birmingham.
In situations where musicians are unable to be together, the system will offer the experience of a group rehearsal. Being unable to meet has been an issue for musicians throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and is an ongoing challenge for players looking to explore and rehearse music without access – for whatever reason – to their colleagues.
Be it piano duets, jazz trios, string quartets or rock groups, mutual listening and timing is key to good performance. Ensemble musicians spend hours working together to hone such timing abilities and so achieve group coherence worthy of a stage.
When unable to rehearse together, individual ensemble musicians may choose instead to play along with a recording of the piece, sometimes even one with their own track omitted. The drawback of this approach is that they miss the vital interactive and dynamic elements of a group rehearsal. Meanwhile attempts to rehearse using video-conferencing are prone to failure, with internet delays rendering split second synchronization – the holy grail of good ensemble – impossible.
ARME – Augmented Reality Music Ensemble – is a system being developed by a collaborative team across three West Midlands Universities and two UK companies specialising in digital music technology.
It presents the lone musician playing a real instrument with a group of virtual colleagues based on audio-visual recordings of professional players. Crucially, each virtual player is timing-sensitive, meaning that their musical timing is individually modulated in real time using mathematical models. Such sensitivity allows for the virtual players to synchronise ‘live’ with each other and with the real player, so mimicking the experience of an actual rehearsal.
Starting out with small groups of classical string players, in duos, trios, and quartets, the team hopes to create a model that can then be broadened out to other ensembles and genres, leading to a versatile, interactive rehearsal tool to be used when traditional ensemble rehearsals are not accessible.
The £1.2M project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation, is a joint project involving researchers at Birmingham City University, University of Warwick, and led by the University of Birmingham (UoB).
Supporting the project, the UK digital music industry is represented by two commercial partners involved in musical training and digital technology: PartPlay and Semantic Audio.
Dr Mark Elliott, from WMG at the University of Warwick comments: “This is a great example of how the collaborative expertise across three West Midlands Universities and industrial partners will be used to combine state-of-the art immersive and audio technologies with mathematical models of human movement to develop research into realistic musician avatars.”
Dr Maria Witek, a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Music (UoB), explains: “By studying how ensemble musicians adapt their timing to achieve a rhythmically cohesive and musically expressive performance, we can develop a novel system allowing a real musician to play with responsive and adaptive virtual players.”
Dr Massimiliano Di Luca, principal investigator and senior lecturer in the School of Psychology (UoB) highlights the opportunity for inclusivity and accessibility that the system offers: “We will be able to provide musical training opportunities when travel and social rehearsals are not feasible. This will be useful in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and for musicians who might – perhaps for geographical, financial or societal reasons – be unable to make rehearsals happen.”

Filed under: Once more, with feeling People with depression listen to sad music because it makes them feel better, according to a small study that is one of the first to investigate why people turn to tearjerkers when they’re already down.  The first part of the study, published recently in the journal Emotion, tried to repeat the findings of a 2015 study that showed that depressed people preferred listening to sad music. Researchers at the University of South Florida asked 76 female undergrads (half of them were diagnosed with depression) to listen to various classical music clips. “Happy” music included Jacques Offenbach’s cheerful “Infernal Gallop,” and “sad” music included Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings,” which is almost universally considered to be extremely depressing. The scientists found that, like in the 2015 study, participants with depression indicated they would rather listen to sad music than happy music.  Then, the researchers gave the participants new clips of happy and sad instrumental music and asked them to describe how the tracks made them feel. Again, the depressed participants preferred the sad music, but they also stated that the sad music made them feel happier. “They actually were feeling better after listening to this sad music than they were before,” study co-author Jonathan Rottenberg told WUSF News. It seemed to have relaxing and calming effects. This challenges the assumption that sad people listen to sad music to make themselves feel worse, when, in fact, it may be a coping mechanism.  Of course, there are many limitations. This is a small study that only looked at female undergraduates, so the results should be taken with a grain of salt. (Psychology, in general, tends to use WEIRD — Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic — subjects too often.) We don’t have a lot of detail regarding exactly why people with depression prefer sad music, and we don’t know how results might change with happy and sad music that has words.  However, it’s an intriguing finding that does replicate some earlier research and could have implications for fields such as music therapy. In this intervention, trained music therapists incorporate music into their interactions with patients by singing, listening to music, or playing music together. It has been used for everything from pain relief to helping cancer patients, and a 2017 Cochrane review of the evidence suggested that it had at least short-term benefits for patients with depression. Though there is no “most common” type of music used in music therapy, the programs can often include instruments like guitars and drums. In the future, maybe there will be a greater focus on sorrowful songs.    Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.

Marshall Trammell – Music Research Strategy / 11 Postures – Borealis Festival;Borealis Festival Les mer om vår gjestekunstner Marshall Trammell og prosjektet Warrior Ethos / Warrior Ecologies her Borealis sin gjestekunstner Marshall Trammell har premiere på sin ferske performance-film og diskusjon der han kobler det historiske Pueblo-opprøret i 1680 til nåtidens Bergen. Trammell knytter sammen et vev av disipliner, kulturer og historier i sin virksomhet. I sin forsknings- og diskusjonspraksis bruker han quiltekoder fra the Underground Railroad (UGRR) som utgangspunkt for å skape diskusjon rundt representasjon, solidaritet og ulike former for motstand og motstandsbevegelser som er tilstede i samfunnene vi lever i. The Underground Railroad er navnet på et nettverk av hemmelige fluktruter og tilfluktssteder som afro-amerikanske slaver kunne benytte for å flykte fra fangenskapen og torturen de var utsatt for i den sørlige delen av USA. Quiltede tepper med ulike mønstre ble benyttet langs denne ruten og utenfor tilfluktsstedene for å formidle kodede beskjeder som skulle være til hjelp for dem som var på flukt. I denne nye filmen bestilt av Borealis fremfører han elleve nye quiltekoder laget av mennesker bosatt i Albuquerque, New Mexico. I dette samfunnet er minnet om Pueblo-opprøret fra 1680 – et blodig sammenstøt mellom det amerikanske urfolket bosatt i New Mexico og de spanske kolonistene – fortsatt en hendelse som resonnerer i befolkningen den dag i dag. Trammell som også er perkusjonist har utformet ulike posisjoner på trommesettet sitt, som sin tolkning av disse elleve kodene. Disse blir presentert i filmen, sammen med en fremførelse der han bruker kodene som et grafisk partitur for å lage musikk. Etter fremførelsen følger en seanse med Marshall live fra sitt hjem i Oakland, LA, der han sammen med publikum i Bergen reflekterer over idéene og lydene skapt ut av disse elleve quiltekodene.

Review: MUSIC RESEARCH STRATEGIES – Eleven Postures | ATTN:Magazine;"SIGE.Formerly found in the incredible improvisatory duo Black Spirituals alongside Zachary James Watkins, percussionist Marshall Trammell is presented here in different collaborative company: firstly within the rich echoes of the Tribune Tower in Oakland, and secondly alongside visual scores generated through his public art installation during his residency with Off Lomas. Pulling on the historic quilt codes of the Underground Railroad, participants were asked to create codes that could be used to send messages to fugitives in their own area of Albuquerque, New Mexico, utilising narratives of fugitivity within the region. This audio document is Trammell’s improvised response for bass drum, snare drum and cowbell – a further transposition of the code, out of the visual fixity of iron-branded wooden squares and into the ever-evaporating domain of reflexive percussive transmission. Just as the codes convey a multitude of information through limited means, Trammell pulls an abundant vocabulary out his stripped-down kit. Every surface is wrung of its expressive potential: the snare ring carefully adjusted to form a bundle of vowels, bass drums sending cautionary shudders of rapid fire beats, cowbell providing clunks of emphasis. Sudden tumbles of activity – which swerve between effortless momentum and stutters of repetition – are followed by passages of patient study, during which a solitary sound is executed, tweaked and executed again. Trammell’s sensitivity to the Tribune Tower itself is always evident, with the acoustics wielded as an extension of his instrument; rumbles of bass drum are gathered into great mists of low frequency, while the sibilance of snare drum wires is sent splashing into the space’s far corners. Regularly the drums throttle right back, with Trammell drinking in the full breadth of the acoustic response before proceeding with the next action. Yet what’s wonderful is that this textural understanding, this process of deep listening and kinetic adjustment, pervades his playing at all times. Even the most frenetic flurries are driven by a steadfast focus on the individual nature of every impact, and the resultant sound bursts with colours that come too quickly to consciously see. © ATTN:Magazine 2022.

In their spare time, Tony Bancroft and his twin brother Tom produce a popular podcast called The Bancroft Brothers Animation Podcast, which is the #1 podcast for animation on iTunes.    Tom Bancroft has over 30 years of experience in the animation industry, most of which as part of Walt Disney Feature Animation where he was an animator for 12 years on such Disney classics as Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Pocahontas (1995), Tarzan (1999) and Brother Bear (2003). He is also the creator of Mushu the dragon in Disney’s Mulan (1998). After Disney, he worked with Big Idea Productions as a Supervising Director/Co-Creator for a VeggieTales DVD series. His popular character design instruction books—Creating Characters with Personality and Character Mentor—have become the most recognized books on designing characters and are required textbooks at many art schools around the world. Bancroft is half of the popular The Bancroft Brothers Animation Podcast with his twin brother Tony, as well as creator of the annual worldwide Instagram drawing event #MerMay. He is currently producing Pencil Test (2021), a documentary feature about 2D animation. Bancroft is the Founder and Artist-in-Residence of the burgeoning Animation program at Lipscomb University, where he mentors more than 100 student animators. He lives with his family in Nashville, Tennessee.  Since opening over 10 years ago, we have sought to make the museum a place where our guests could find animation, innovation, and inspiration and immerse themselves in the remarkable life story of Walt Disney—the man who raised animation to an art, tirelessly pursued innovation, and created a distinctly American legacy, transforming the entertainment world. Over the past year, we have increased our digital presence to stay true to our mission. Your donations ensure that we can continue opening our museum virtually to the world, and that future generations can continue to be inspired by Walt Disney’s life and legacy.

The mental health benefits of group singing activities have increasingly featured in many research projects and in the media. However, the focus is generally on the benefits for the singers rather than upon the challenges of facilitating singing groups with an emphasis on mental wellbeing. In this context, the demands upon facilitators are wide-ranging, requiring a unique combination of musical and extra-musical skills and knowledge. Surprisingly, training for this complex role is limited, and group singing facilitators may not have access to some of the resources that would support them in their work. The aims of this research project were to identify the core skills required by group singing facilitators, to explore their needs for training or professional support, and to develop an accessible set of resources based on the research findings. The project began with a scoping review, which informed the design of two national online surveys for singers and group facilitators. The surveys were followed by an action research project involving singing facilitators who work with groups of singers with experience of living with mental health conditions. The practical outcome of the project was an online ‘toolkit’ of resources informed by the research evidence. Speaker bio: Dr Yoon Irons:
	Yoon is a singer, musician, music therapist, and researcher. Her research focuses on developing and delivering singing programmes for people living with longer-term health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, Parkinson’s, Aphasia, chronic pain, and spinal cord injuries. Yoon is a research fellow at University of Derby, where she conducts the staff orchestra. 
	Professor David Sheffield:
	David's work aims to understand the impact of stress on health, wellbeing and performance. He uses a range of methodologies (e.g. epidemiological, experimental, psychophysiological, interviews). His current research interests include: Nature Connectedness; Music and well-being; Pain and Pain Management in Patients and Athletes; Compassion and mindfulness-based approaches to living; Inequalities and justice in healthcare; and Cardiovascular Responses to Stress. 
	Dr Michael Bonshor:
	Michael has a background as a professional musician, conductor and teacher. He was a co-investigator on the University of Derby’s research project on singing, group facilitation and mental health, and is currently involved in an arts and health project in partnership with the NHS. Michael is Course Director for the University of Sheffield’s MA in Music Psychology in Education, Performance and Wellbeing.
	  To this day, musical leadership remains one of the most male-dominated musical areas. As late as 2013, women conductors achieved a significant first when Marin Alsop became the first woman to conduct the BBC’s Last Night of the Proms. Indeed, musical leadership itself is often constructed as residing in male authority figures, quintessentially exemplified through the maestro conductor. This ‘maestro myth’ (as Norman Lebrecht characterised it, 1997) has been perpetuated since the mid-nineteenth century through the ‘maestro writing tradition’ of male conductors from Berlioz (1843) and Wagner (1869), through Stokowski (1944), Furtwängler (1953), and Boult (1963), to Boulez (2003). This presentation shifts the spotlight to considering women’s musical leadership and explores the impetuses behind the founding of the Women’s Musical Leadership Online Network (WMLON), by the authors in 2019, and also presents its initial findings. With the dual aim of both researching women’s musical leadership and acting as a support network for women musical leaders and potential leaders, WMLON interrogates the current context of women in musical leadership with a specific focus on three areas: women in the music industries, women in educational leadership, and women leading contemporary musical practices. WMLON was established following the first International Conference on Women in/and Musical Leadership, speaks in partnership with the forthcoming Routledge Companion to Women and Musical Leadership: The Nineteenth Century and Beyond, and will be further developed via an AHRC network grant between January 2022 and November 2023. WMLON is open to all. Speaker Bio: Laura Hamer is a Senior Lecturer in Music and Associate Director of Student Support (Arts and Humanities) at The Open University. Her research specialism lies in Women in Music. Her books include Female Composers, Conductors, Performers: Musiciennes of Interwar France, 1919-1939 (Routledge, 2018) and The Cambridge Companion to Women in Music since 1900 (Cambridge University Press, 2021). She is currently co-editing, with Helen Julia Minors, The Routledge Companion to Women's Musical Leadership: The Nineteenth Century and Beyond and PI of the AHRC-funded Women's Musical Leadership Online Network.

Being highly paid to create art might be the goal for any composer, but it is an elite few who reap substantial financial rewards while retaining artistic control. Anecdotal evidence, supported by a 2015 Sound and Music survey, suggests that the majority of UK artists who define themselves as composers, actually earn a small percentage of their income, if anything at all, from their art. Commercial music is another matter: the primary difference being that success is measured in part by financial gain, and artistic quality is ultimately defined by the commissioner. This seminar is a report on a project that I undertook for an advertising agency on behalf of a large international company. I was invited to take part specifically because of my interests in esoteric sound and visual relationships and non-linear programming software, but had to find a way to create something that would appeal to a group who appreciate innovation only if it produces familiar results. I invited composer John Lely to join me in the process and will present a piece of interactive software that we designed to fulfil the commission. As someone who has limited experience of commercial composition, this work has led me to re-evaluate some youthful ideologies and question the nature of artistic satisfaction as well as the issue of dissemination of practice as research. Speaker Bio: Professor Dominic Murcott is a composer, percussionist, curator and educator based in London. Beginning as a self-taught musician he played drums and percussion with many influential bands and is the vibraphonist with art-pop outfit The High Llamas. Recording has been with Stereolab, Pavement and St Etienne to name a few. Changing direction he studied music formally and received a PhD in Composition from Goldsmiths College before being made Head of Composition at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. Now in his 19th year in the post, the department is oversubscribed and renown for its innovative approach to composition training. An expert on the music of Conlon Nancarrow, he lectures, curates festivals and undertakes public speaking around the world. Recent compositions include The Harmonic Canon, a piece for US/Japanese percussionists arx duo featuring a computer designed custom-made 1⁄2 ton double bell. Premiered at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival it available in glorious vinyl on nonclassical and won a 2018 BASCA British Composer Award. An avid forager and consumer of interesting food, in May 2019 he presented a special event at the British Library on taste in food and music with legendary chef Heston Blumenthal. The right hand in the bell of a horn serves several functions. On a mundane level the hand assists in the instrument being in a position in which it can be played, but the soft flesh of the hand also aids the timbre of the instrument and the exact position of the hand is essential for fine tuning. With historical instruments and their associated techniques the right hand can have a greater or lesser importance. For some early works the instrument is played without the insertion of the hand into the bell and for others the musician manipulates their right hand in the bell in order to create notes (“hand technique”). The position of the hand (or even the absence of the hand) greatly affects the timbre. Another way of changing the timbre is to use a mute, however this requires the musician to break off from playing in order to insert the mute. Whilst composers normally accommodate this in the music (writing an adequate number of bars preceding and following the con sordino passage) a significant number of nineteenth-century compositions exist where no such allowances have been made. Some of these later ones can be “accommodated” as it is possible to almost create the affect of a mute on valved instruments by using the right hand in lieu of a mute but this option is not available to the earlier natural instruments. In this seminar I will illustrate the problems inherent in these works, suggest solutions based on ideas that many nineteenth century HIP practitioners are currently exploring concerning tempo flexibility and dislocation, and discuss how the solutions may themselves suggest further ideas about the tempo flexibility composer/performers had in mind. Speaker Bio Anneke Scott is a leading exponent of historical horn playing. Her work takes her throughout the globe and throughout the centuries of music with a repertoire incorporating music and instruments from the late seventeenth century through to the present day.Anneke is principal horn of a number of internationally renowned period instrument ensembles including Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and the English Baroque Soloists, ensemble Pygmalion, The Orchestra of the Sixteen, the Irish Baroque Orchestra, and the Dunedin Consort and Players and many others. Anneke enjoys an international solo career and discography embracing three centuries of virtuosic horn works. Her expertise in baroque horn repertoire ensures that she is frequently to be heard performing the famous obligato arias of composers such as Bach and Handel as well as solo concertos from this period. Her critically acclaimed solo recordings also include three discs focussing on the music of the leading Parisian horn player of the nineteenth century; Jaques-François Gallay. Anneke enjoys collaborating with a wide group of musicians and is a key member of a number of chamber music ensembles including The Prince Regent's Band andBoxwood & Brass. She regularly works with leading period keyboardists including Steven Devine, Neal Peres da Costa, Geoffrey Govier and Kathryn Cok and period harpist Frances Kelly. She teaches at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, University of Birmingham. In 2018 she was awarded Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Music and in 2019 she was one of the recipients of the International Horn Society “Punto Award”. More information on her work can be found at www.annekescott.com The dissemination of Christianity was banned in Korea until the late nineteenth century, but by the end of the twentieth century Protestant Christianity was the most popular religion in (South) Korea. Despite the tremendous impact of this religion on various domains in Korea, including music, it has eluded Anglophone music studies, given this discipline’s tendency to treat the Western world and the non-Western world as separate cultural spheres. This talk considers how we might tell the history of Korean Christian music as a site of circulation, transformation, and agency. It focuses on the first decades of Protestantism in Korea, when the North American missionaries had immense power over indigenous Christian communities. It explores the musical culture that formed in this milieu in terms of a range of Christian artefacts which were forged in the context of Korean socio-cultural heterogeneity and in the crucible of early twentieth-century trans-Pacific history, marked by the rise of the U.S. and Japan as regional powers. Speaker Bio: Hannah Hyun Kyong Chang is a Lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield. She obtained her PhD in Musicology from UCLA, with a dissertation fellowship from the American Musicological Society (AMS). Subsequently, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University's Institute of Sacred Music and a visiting assistant professor at the Department of Music, New York University. She is currently working on a project called “Pacific Voicings: Korean Hymns and Prayers in the Age of Empire, 1884-1945” as a recipient of an AHRC Research, Development, and Engagement Fellowship. Her next project will examine modernist composers in Korea and Japan. She currently serves on the AMS Council and is a co-convenor of AMS's Global Music History Study Group. In this talk I’ll present early results of a study concerned with sound recordings in early music appreciation, part of a larger ongoing grant by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. In particular, I’ll present a tentative conception, that of music depreciation, or the deliberate classifying of music as lesser and of lower quality. This conception is evident in the early engagement by those working in music appreciation as they addressed the music of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC). I will reveal how a set of criteria for appreciating classical music was misapplied to BIPOC music, resulting in an active program of music depreciation in the most popular music teaching texts of that era. These materials, present primarily via sound recording and textbooks, reveal widespread practices of music depreciation, the labelling of BIPOC music as uncivilised, uncultured, primitive, and illiterate. Following Ewell’s (2020) call for intersectional analysis of music theory’s white racial frame, and using a theoretical framework drawn from sound studies, I will argue that a critical intersectional reengagement with the racist and classist origins of music appreciation can help make the case for setting new foundations for teaching about music, following similar calls to de-sacralise listening (Rinsema, 2018), to adopt a diasporic approach (Gustafson, 2020), or to work with multimedia approaches that rest on Black music theory (Thibeault, 2021) all in an effort to continue to decolonise and otherwise confront some of music education’s most problematic and least understood histories. Speaker Bio: Matthew D. Thibeault is Associate Professor of Culture and Creative Arts at the Education University of Hong Kong. His recent research draws on frameworks from sound studies to illuminate the enmeshment of sound recordings and music pedagogy across the 20th century. He maintains active engagement with participatory music through the ukulele, banjo, and Okinawan sanshin. Thibeault’s publications and other details can be found on his professional website: www.matthewthibeault.com Suk-Jun Kim studied theology at Yonsei university, South Korea and Recording Engineering at OIART (Ontario Institute of Audio and Recording Technology). He earned a master’s degree in Music Technology in Northwestern University and a Ph.D. in composition at the University of Florida. Currently, Kim is senior lecturer in Electroacoustic Music and Sound Art at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and Director of PG Research in the School of Language, Literature, Music, and Visual Culture. As a composer and sound artist, Kim has won several international composition awards and attracted commissions. Kim was a DAAD resident composer between 2009-2010. Kim has written two books - Hasla and Humming – and is now working on new project on sound studies, including one that examines key aspects that have established the audience in the 21st century.
	  We often hear composers and sound artists say “Listen!” with an apostrophe. But what else would it mean to listen, if it is not an act of lending our ears to something that is not our own? In this talk, Suk-Jun Kim focusses on three incidents in which we lend our ears for listening, which have been explored in his recent book, Humming: John Cage with his Lecture on Nothing, A King from Italo Calvino’s short story, A King Listens, and humming, a vocalic act closest to being mute, or silence. ""Perception of emotion and meaning in music is to a large extent probabilistic rather  than deterministic. Certain properties of music may increase the likelihood that a  particular emotion is perceived over another or a particular imagery or association  is evoked. What emotion or imagery is perceived also depends on contextual factors such as the apriori probability of emotions, listeners’ sensitivities and biases, 
	and the distinctives of the properties within the musical context. In this presentation,  I will explore the use of Bayes’ rule to model the perception of emotion and meaning, and to capture the influence of these contextually shaping factors. Considering emotion perception, according to Bayes’ rule, the posterior probability of perceiving an emotion given a musical property M is equal to the likelihood of the  observation of the musical property if the hypothesis of that emotion was true, times  the prior probability of that emotion (in the context of competing emotions). To  develop this method, measures of prior probability of emotions are required as well 
	as probability estimates of musical properties in emotional expressions. Analogously, the posterior probability of multimodal imagery given musical property M is equal to the likelihood of that musical property in the context of the hypothesised multimodal phenomenon, additionally taking into account the prior probability of the phenomenon and the frequency of occurrence of the musical property across multimodal phenomena. Finally, probability calculations can be used to examine relationships between emotion and meaning in music: what is the posterior probability of an emotion given a multimodal association or vice versa what is the probability of a given multimodal imagery given an emotion?  Data from existing research articles are used to get a proof of concept of these applications of Bayes’ rule to model perception of emotion and meaning in music. Future directions for research are discussed as well as benefits and limitations of the adoption of a Bayesian approach to music cognition."" Description How does a listener know immediately when she or he walks into a room with a live grand piano instead of a recording? One reason is the complex interactions between the piano sound and the space that surrounds it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is ubiquitous, yet often ignores the spatial presence of the live instrument and performer. Yet research in the field of music perception points to the essential role of situated or embodied cognition our listening experience. My composition Cosmologies for piano and three-dimensional electronics seeks to place the embodied presence of the instrument and its performer at the centre, using machine learning of audio features to decipher the intricate interdependencies of timbre and space that bring an instrument to life. The results explode the space inside the piano out to the space of the concert hall, creating a virtual reality (VR) environment for the ears, and situating the listener inside the instrument to experience its secret inner life. Speaker's bio: Aaron Einbond’s work explores the intersection of instrumental music, field recording, sound installation, and interactive technology. He released portrait album Without Words with Ensemble Dal Niente on Carrier Records and Cities with Yarn/Wire and Matilde Meireles on multi.modal/NMC Recordings. His awards include a Giga-Hertz Förderpreis, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and artistic research residencies at IRCAM and ZKM. He teaches music composition, sound, and technology at City, University of London. The advent of the performing hologram opens up significant questionsaround the fate of “liveness” in the digital age, blurring if not collapsing distinctions between absence/presence, live/real, original/copy as well
	as transforming well-worn ideas such as authenticity. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Japan and the UK, this talk explores the case of virtual idol, Hatsune Miku, originally a marketing mascot for voice synthesis software but who now tours globally and is a representative agent of a new breed of virtual performers. As well as introducing the Miku media model – a relatively flat media ecology where fans are also Miku producers – the talk will offer some speculative thoughts on how a Miku performance “works” as an assemblage of love, labour and socio-technical affordances. Who or what is performing, how is liveness managed when the performer is pure code, and what does this tell us about relations between live music, participatory cultures and virtuality? In this talk, I draw on my recently published book, ‘Class, Control, and Classical Music’ (Oxford University Press, 2019), to discuss why, in the UK, classical music remains predominantly played by white middle-class people. I draw on data from an ethnographic study with young people playing in classical music ensembles in the south of England to explain how the inclusions and exclusions that are visible today were set up historically in the establishment of music education institutions in the late Victorian period. The link between class and classical music is also apparent in the social relations of classical music pedagogy, such as what I am calling a ‘pedagogy of correction’. These social relations are not, I argue, separate from the music itself, but are in part formed by the demands of classical music’s distinctive aesthetic, repertoire, and instruments. These demands create an aesthetic ideal of ‘getting it right’. This means that in order to change the demographic patterns of who plays classical music, the aesthetic itself will need to change. Speakers Bio: Dr Anna Bull is a Senior Lecturer in sociology at the University of Portsmouth. Her research interests include class and gender inequalities in classical music education; and staff sexual misconduct in higher education. Anna has published in leading sociology and music education journals and her monograph Class, Control, and Classical music, looking at the culture of classical music among young middle class classical musicians in the south of England, was published in 2019 by Oxford University Press, and in 2020 was joint winner of the Philip Abrams Memorial Prize from the British Sociological Association. Anna is also a director of The 1752 Group (https://1752group.com/), a research and campaigning organisation working to address staff sexual misconduct in higher education. Lillis Ó Laoire is Professor of Irish Language and Folklore at NUI Galway. He has published on the song traditions of Tory Island and with Sean Williams an award winning biography of Joe Heaney. He is a noted performer being awarde TG4 traditional singer of the year in 2020. Sean-nós song is regarded by many as the hegemonic core of Irish Traditional Music (ITM). Central to sean-nós are themes of erotic love and loss. Irish Traditional Music is conventionally regarded as conservative in outlook, reinforcing heteronormative binary gender identities, thus creating a challenging environment for those identifying as LGBTQ+, who also enjoy performing or consuming traditional music. This paper will briefly outline the rationale of such a conservative outlook within a cultural nationalistic framework, before exploring some transgressive examples, showing that 'tradition' and 'heternormativity' are not necessarily synonymous. This aims to open a space for the recognition and validation of non-binary histories within ITM, and especially within the song tradition. Research and public discourse on the social impact of making music (recently, also called SIMM) have become more visible in the last ten years, accounting for a diversity of situations, in which music practices play an active role in processes of social transformation, at different levels. Juan Rojas will provide a perspective on the current landscape of SIMM activities in Colombia, as studied within the framework of the larger international research project, “Music for Social Impact: Practitioners’ work, context, and beliefs.” The project aims at comparing between the findings in four countries—Colombia, Belgium, Finland, and the UK—but the talk will revolve around the organizational, cultural, and political aspects that have shaped the Colombian SIMM field, with occasional comparisons, for context. In Colombia, SIMM activities seem to be notoriously divided between small grassroots organizations and large national level institutional programs, both focusing on the attention of vulnerable and marginalized populations, mostly people in conditions of poverty or victims of the armed conflict. This divide is a partial result of the implementation of neoliberal policies of cultural decentralization since the 1990s, which restricted regional budgets, while privileging national-level programs focused on Western classical musics. While this model caters for thousands of people, local SIMM activities, which include a wide range of culturally diverse musical practices, are mostly unattended in a nation that publicly praises its cultural diversity. Is this problematic? This presentation explores the Colombian case from a cross-cultural perspective, aiming at future understandings of the larger SIMM field. Speakers Bio Juan S. Rojas is a Colombian ethnomusicologist, musician, and anthropologist. He received his Ph.D. in ethnomusicology at Indiana University Bloomington, in 2018, and is an experienced researcher and performer of diverse Afro-Diasporic musical expressions, specializing in traditional and popular Colombian musics. His dissertation, titled “Drums, Raps, and Song-Games: An Ethnography of Music and Peacebuilding in the Afro-Colombian Town of Libertad,” explores the potential contributions of local musics to processes of conflict transformation. He teaches ensemble courses and graduate seminars at University of El Bosque and University of Los Andes, in Colombia and is a member of the research team at Sonidos Enraizados Cultural Corporation. He currently holds a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the project “Music for Social Impact: Practitioners’ work, context, and beliefs,” hosted by Guildhall School of Music and Drama, as part of his work at the UNESCO Chair in Education, Arts, and a Culture of Peace, at Juan N. Corpas University Foundation (Colombia). Lewis Granom’s Plain and easy instructions for playing on the German flute is significant in being the earliest work on the pedagogy of the instrument by a named English author. Legal records recently discovered in The National Archives reveal that the treatise had an extraordinary genesis, being largely the product of lessons given by Granom to its dedicatee, John Bourke, a wealthy Irish landowner who was incarcerated for debt in the King’s Bench Prison at the time. The litigation that followed the breakdown of their friendship sheds light on a range of matters, including the patron/composer relationship, their musical tastes and views regarding Handel’s posthumous reputation, the sources used to compile the Instructions, the cost of music lessons, copying and other related expenses, and the cultural and social life of one of London’s more salubrious gaols. Speakers Bio Cheryll Duncan is a Senior Lecturer in Music at the RNCM. Her research investigates professional music culture in Britain during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with a particular focus on records of the equity and common-law courts. She has published several articles in leading musicological journals, and contributed a chapter to Geminiani Studies (ed. C. Hogwood). Her monograph on the violinist and composer Felice Giardini was published in 2020. Florence Price (1887–1953) is often described as the first African American woman to achieve national and international success as a composer. However, this deserved accolade tends to exceptionalize her achievements as a female composer of African descent and thus to obscure or negate the rich context in which she worked. “Composing a Symphonist: Florence Price and the Hand of Black Women’s Fellowship” resituates Price in the dynamic cultural movement of the Black Chicago Renaissance and recognizes how a number of African American women played diverse and crucial roles within it. I illuminate Price’s Chicago, in which a female-led community shaped an American art music that uplifted black musical idioms. Positioning Price’s transition from Little Rock, Arkansas, against the backdrop of the Great Migration, the unfolding narrative explores the first six years in which she lived in Chicago (1927–1933); it delves into the community that awaited her and the particular influence of Nora Douglas Holt, Estella Conway Bonds, and Maude Roberts George in her ascent to become the first nationally-recognized black female symphonist. The result is a geographical and socio-cultural mapping of Price’s Chicago that reveals the clasped hand of black women’s fellowship. Speakers Bio Dr. Samantha Edge is the Lord Crewe Junior Research Fellow in Music at Lincoln College, University of Oxford. She is a leading interpreter and scholar of the African American composer Florence B. Price. She received the Society for American Music’s Eileen Southern Fellowship (2019) and a Newberry Library Short-Term Residential Fellowship (2019) for her work on women's contributions to concert life in interwar Chicago. She has written for American Music, Women and Music, and the Kapralova Society Journal. She released Four Women: Music for Solo Piano by Price, Kaprálová, Bilsland and Bonds with Wave Theory Records in 2018. Her latest album is called Fantasie Nègre: The Piano Music of Florence Price. Join at: https://zoom.us/j/99483467755 This talk will focus on a recent collaboration between myself and Sarah Watts which used Machine Learning as a third collaborator in the creation of a new piece for contrabass clarinet and track. The aim of our research was to use Machine Learning as an objective observer of the idiosyncratic behaviours exhibited in either our performance or composition practices and to create a piece that documented these behaviours within it. We trained our chosen algorithm (PRiSM SampleRNN) on recordings of Sarah’s improvisations and of my compositions. This generated new audio samples, exhibiting behaviours that the algorithm had ‘learnt’ from our original data. These samples, representative of an artificial space between Sarah and I were used to create a new work: ‘You may own us but we are going to inform on you’. This piece aimed to give equal space to all collaborators. In this talk I will discuss the social and ethical concerns and benefits that arose from giving a non-human this position in the collaboration.  Biography: Ellen Sargen is an alumna of The University of Sheffield (BMus, MA) and is currently studying for a PhD in Composition at the Royal Northern College of Music, supported by the North West Consortium";https://sheffield.ac.uk/music/research/research-seminars;
UCLA lab asks: ‘What does your favorite song taste like?’ | Mirage News;Andreas Branch Nina Eidsheim What is the taste of your favorite song? A new lab at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music explores a range of questions like that one, rejecting the premise of music as merely a sonic experience. After opening in the summer of 2020, the Practice-based Experimental Epistemology Research Lab — or PEER Lab — is preparing to celebrate its launch with a series of free public workshops. The first event is scheduled for April 29, with others to be held on the final Thursday in successive months. Audiences will be invited to experience music using all of their senses and reconsider how their senses guide their experiences. (Learn more and register for the events.) The PEER Lab is led by UCLA musicologist and vocalist Nina Eidsheim, whose research centers on the concept of music as an event rather than as an object. Epistemology refers to the theory of knowledge or the systems we use to establish knowledge.

Novel heterogeneous catalysts explained in Lego-animated ‘synthesis instruction manual’ | Mirage News;Ilse Denekamp, a PhD student working under the supervision of Prof. Gadi Rothenberg at the University of Amsterdam’s Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, has ‘translated’ her PhD research in a short film. The one-minute animation highlights the advantages of novel tailor-made single-site catalytic materials for heterogeneous catalysis. Ilse Denekamp will defend her PhD thesis on 7 April. Using a combination of computer-animation techniques, Denekamp produced an ‘instruction manual’ explaining her research in the language of Lego. In her PhD thesis she describes a building-block approach for making covalently-bonded polymers with tailored catalytic properties. These polymers are stable up to 400 °C, combining the specific metal sites of organometallic complexes with the stability and ease of separation of solid catalysts. While developing these materials, Denekamp and co-workers used Lego bricks as models. This gave her the idea of presenting the catalyst synthesis protocol as a Lego-animated instruction manual. From there, it was a short step to installing software, trying out different configurations and adding music and voice-overs.  To watch this video you’ll need to accept all . Cookie settings. Prof. Rothenberg acknowledges that such efforts cost time and effort, but views it as time well invested. He sees short animations as an important tool in science communication and part of a set of skills that help people further in their careers. “Communication across disciplines and cultures is the key to successful collaboration these days. Being able to explain your ideas clearly to a broad audience is emphasised also in industry.” His group often uses short films to explain and highlight their research. Denekamp, who submitted her thesis 4 months before the end of her contract, had ample time to invest in showcasing her chemistry research as well as trying out new ideas. Rothenberg, who has been teaching soft skills workshops across Europe for two decades, even sees a broader audience: “Attracting people to science is an important goal for researchers. We should do this at an early age and using the right tools. Animations such as these highlight the creative and fun aspects of science, as well as its importance in solving technological and societal problems.” Ilse M.

Bookseller Code (AE) What is it that drives people to undertake music research? Such interest frequently grows from on-the-ground experiences as learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively, educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine the direction of the research to be undertaken.Performing Music Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting, analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin research in music education, psychology, and performance science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their research questions, select methods that are appropriate for addressing their questions, and apply those methods systematically and rigorously. Each chapter contains a study guide, comprising a chapter summary, a list of keywords, and suggestions for further discussion, and the book concludes with a resources section, including a glossary and supplementary material to support advanced statistical analysis.The book''s companion website provides information designed to facilitate access to original research and to testknowledge and understanding.

 Reach Music Publishing has acquired a 50% interest, as well as worldwide administration rights, to the Glenn Tipton song catalog, reports Murray Stassen of Music Business Worldwide. The acquisition covers Tipton’s songwriting catalog of almost 200 songs as a member of Judas Priest, including works dating back to 1979, beginning with the album Sin After Sin and continuing through to the band’s last studio album, Firepower, released in 2018. Tipton’s solo albums, Baptizm Of Fire and Edge Of The World are also included in the acquisition. Glenn Tipton said: “I deliberated for a long time on whether to relinquish 50% of my publishing to another company and realized as soon as I had a conversation with Michael Closter and Scott Rubin from Reach Music just how knowledgeable they are of both mine and Judas Priest’s catalog and that they would be really pro-active with the songs.” “I believe I now have a team who understand and are geared up to deal with metal and look forward to working together in the future!” Learn more at this location.   April 18, 2022, 12 hours ago

Second-year Medical Student Reflects on Music, Research and Volunteer Opportunities - News Center;"Mallika Patel, a second-year medical student. Originally from Germantown Hills, Ill., second-year medical student Mallika Patel says she considers Northwestern her second home. She attended Northwestern for her undergraduate studies, where she was a dual-degree student in flute performance and neuroscience. Since beginning medical school, Patel has continued to pursue her passion for music by performing with other healthcare providers and medical students in the Northwestern Medical Orchestra and the National Virtual Medical Orchestra. During her time at Feinberg so far, Patel says she has gained valuable clinical exposure and research experience. Last spring and summer, she also had the opportunity to volunteer with the COVID-19 Med Supply Drive’s Illinois chapter, a volunteer-based organization established by medical students that provides personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline healthcare workers across the state. Read a Q&A with Patel below. I went to undergrad at Northwestern and have a lot of family in the area, but more importantly, Feinberg has a large focus on early clinical exposure, and I have definitely found that to be true. I’ve loved my clinic and have gotten so much experience seeing patients, coordinating clinic schedules as an ECMH chief and learning from upperclassmen. Besides that, I think there’s a big emphasis on wellness here. Faculty are super flexible, we have mentors for small groups of 20 people: Much of the core parts of being a Feinberg student are in a way wellness oriented. I’m most interested in internal medicine, partly because of my clinical experience with Dr. Jean-Jacques in her internal medicine and geriatrics clinics. Besides that, I did a research project last summer with Dr. Lindquist about the experience of home care agencies and professional caregivers during COVID, specifically regarding PPE and staffing shortages at the beginning of the pandemic. I’m also currently working on my Area of Scholarly Concentration (AOSC) project with Dr. Kandula, which is part of a larger study she’s running about South Asian cardiovascular health, called the SAHELI study. It involves a 16-week lifestyle program where participants work on their diet and exercise habits, as well as their mental wellness and stress-reducing activities. We’ve been interviewing participants, community stakeholders and the health educators who lead the weekly sessions. Eventually, we’re going to publish their perspectives so SAHELI can be implemented more effectively and hopefully one day can be adapted to a community-led approach in settings that don’t have the same resources we have here at Northwestern. Med Supply Drive was started by medical students at Georgetown University and has blossomed into a nationwide program where people from all different states have created their own chapters. A childhood friend asked me if I wanted to help out and start an Illinois chapter. At the time, I was at home in central Illinois since Feinberg went virtual for first- and second-year students after spring break. My parents had been talking about how scarce PPE was and how they had a really rough time trying to find the bare minimum. With my mom being an infectious disease doctor, it was scary, to say the least. When I got on board, we started making a lot of phone calls to different companies we thought might have anything to donate. There were a couple of instances where we got huge donations from in and out of state to central Illinois. It was really interesting to be involved in a supply chain that I had never really thought about until the pandemic happened. I got to work with other Feinberg students as well as people from other medical schools, and we ended up having people from all parts of the state get involved, too. It was interesting to see how a student-run organization can create change and hopefully, people will see how capable and valuable medical students are. I’m hoping to figure that out in the next year while I’m doing rotations. I was shadowing a lot, especially in the fall semester, to get a better idea of all of these specialties I had never really gotten a chance to see. There are several that I think are really interesting, but something that’s great for a day may not be when I have a four-week or eight-week rotation in it. So, I’m trying not to decide too quickly and end up changing my mind eight times. Do things that you genuinely care about. It’s obvious when people are pursuing things they’re passionate about, and who doesn’t love that. Also, I think I’ve learned so much more in my second year of medical school because I’ve pushed myself to speak up more. I’m confident in not knowing everything, and that has genuinely changed my medical school experience. Comments are closed.

The communications on the CAN bus are usually quite secluded from any form of digital engine control. For example, the Oxygen and MAP sensors might broadcast on the CAN bus, and you may be able to spoof them so in the ECU it causes an engine light or bad fuel economy. Beyond that, the CAN bus is pretty much just information being sent about the status of things. There is usually no control taking place via those connections. All co  You are very wrong. You should read the posted paper. You should read the posted paper. It turns out that the links in the article don't actually take you to the paper. So, where is the paper? The article is too short on detail to find out what this is really about? That's simply wrong. Lots of safety relevant systems, like ESP, communicate via CAN (or FlexRey in more modern cars). So, in theory, if you hijacked the whole bus you could pretty easily kill everyone inside the car. In praxis, however, it's not quite that simple. e.g. the bus driver of a FlexRay bus will electrically prevent sending any data outside of your designated timeslot, so you can't override data send by other ECUs.

The stereo/satnav sits on one, vital systems sit on the other - never the twain shall meet. Sensationalist reporting as usual... Your car will probably have a lot more then just two busses. It will probably even have ECUs that are conected to more then two busses. However, I'd guess that in theroy the network of ECUs and busses will be fully connected, e.g. most systems report data to the dashboard, so that will be a point where many busses will meet. (Not that this would help taking over the bus or safety relevant systems in any relevant way) From one point of view, it is isolated.  The car is not connected to any other devices. From another, the components are not isolated from each other for all kinds of reasons.  The CAN bus hosts all kinds of things that might care about each other.  Door locks talk to lighting systems.  The tire pressure sensors talk to the dashboard.  The speedometer talks to the stability controls.  The stability controls tie into the braking systems.  The stereo shuts off when the doors open.

If your car uses the CAN-bus for stereo controls, and has only a single CAN-bus, then yeah, you can probably hack the security, which is integrated into the PCM, from the stereo. I've never seen a keyless entry system connected to a CAN bus. I have in no way worked on all cars out there, but that would be what we with common sense call 'poor system design'.

This is especially true when the car has a special key required for starting. The PCM is on the CAN bus. QED. Newer VWs have the following things all on a single CAN bus (and there actually is a justification for it): Engine control unitTransmission control unitAnti-lock brakes/traction/stability control (and these can actually command the ECU to accelerate or decelerate)Instrument cluster (this one can command the ECU to shut down, if it thinks the car is stolen)RadioClimate controlCentral convenience module (handles remote locks, power windows, and things like that)AirbagsElectric power steering So, the reason for  And they actually share the address space without any network segmentation and routing? You know, CAN has something between a NAT and a network bridge - can't remember the term used by the spec right now - which was designed to allow controlled routing between parallel networks precisely for such things as this.

A programmer who is CAN-savvy could probably make some money right now rolling a portable firewalling framework. The thing is, that those ""gateways"" can be smart and only allow certain packet types between certain senders and receivers. It is a kind of a very simple firewall, actually. In a C5, it most likely restricts communications only to those packets that were intended to be used by design, so it should let the airbag controller send a 112 request to the stereo, but not let the stereo deploy airbags spontaneously, even if the controller actualy does support triggering over CAN (I have no idea wether it does).

I can't see it being terribly likely on its own. But, this CD with magic code Nice way to put it. I find it hard to believe that there could be a flaw in handling of uncompressed audio data that could be used to take control over the CD player in the first place. If we are talking about the standard stereo 16 bits per sample audio, then it is unlikely to have a flaw in the code to handle it for too reasons. It is ******* simple. There are no possibility of the code to handle it having forgotten to check for invalid inputs, as every possible combination of  These days, car stereos are not car stereos, they are stereos + MP3 players + iPod docks + navigation systems + bluetooth car kits + emergency help systems and more. And a lot of this stuff needs to talk to the cars sensors and systems (e.g. these systems may require knowing how fast the car is going or the like) It's not a big stretch to assume their electronics are designed by the lowest bidder. The fact that such a device would run arbitrary code from a music file, that tells me today's programmers really are as idiotic and useless as I assumed.  It's music, decoded by some type of finite state machine.  There is no dynamic execution, it should treat ""trojan code"" like any other bits in the input stream and play them as static noise, or skip them if the checksum fails.  The decoder shouldn't even be capable of sma  The fact that such a device would run arbitrary code from a music file,It can't.

In particular, steering is not electrically intermediated on most cars (new electric cars aside) and we've never demonstrated acceleration control (engine start/shutdown, yes... acceleration no... although I'd be surprised if it wasn't possible).

Longtime Portland DJs Anjali and the Incredible Kid Have Quit XRAY.FM;"DJ Anjali and the Incredible Kid (Eden Swartz)  After seven years with XRAY.FM, stalwart Portland DJs Anjali and the Incredible Kid have resigned, citing the station's handling of complaints from current and former staffers against Jefferson Smith, the station's onetime executive director. Last week, the pair hosted the last episode of Chor Bazaar, a music show they've hosted every week on XRAY since the station's inception. ""As a brown woman I no longer feel safe there,"" DJ Anjali, aka Anjali Hursh, wrote in a public letter posted on social media. ""As an activist I cannot be associated with the station that still employs and trusts Jefferson Smith."" ""I refuse to create free content based on 40 years of personal music research for a station that does not share my values,"" the statement continues, ""that actively protects toxic masculinity and profits from my expertise."" Neither the station board nor Smith immediately responded to requests for comment. Last summer, nine XRAY employees submitted letters to the station's board, alleging unprofessional behavior and illegal labor practices by Smith. The letters sparked two human resources investigations and eventually led to the resignation of XRAY's founder and board president, Jenny Logan. Related: Staffers at XRAY.FM Allege Unprofessional Behavior by the Station's Executive Director, Jefferson Smith. On Jan. 1, Smith stepped down from his role as executive director. He continues to work with the music and talk-radio nonprofit as an on-air host and under a new title of senior adviser. Hursh is not convinced the transition has led to real change. ""It just seemed like everything was to defuse any momentum or anger we had,"" she tells WW. ""There's been little recognition of the harm that he's done. Some of these women are actually traumatized."" One of the letters submitted last summer to the board, written by the station's former finance manager, Lillian Karabaic, was later leaked to station DJs. Hursh is not the first DJ to resign since last summer's events and Smith's transition to a new role. But she and the Incredible Kid are two of the most prominent DJs to leave the station. The duo, who spin everything from Bhangra to urban Desi and cumbia, have been longtime fixtures of Portland's music scene, hosting popular dance nights like Tropitaal and the 20-years-running Andaz. During the pandemic, they've continued to host dance nights on Twitch. XRAY's DJs are all volunteers. Hursh says that prior to the events of last summer and fall, she and many of the station's other DJs were unaware of the station's office culture. Karabaic's letter, as well as the response from the board and some fellow DJs, was ""eye-opening"" for Hursh. ""Over and over there was anger at who was trying to 'take down XRAY,' but almost no concern for the staff that had to suffer while working under an abusive boss,"" reads Hursh's letter. ""I've sat through so many meetings at this point, they are a waste of my time. I cannot sit through another meeting where questions go unanswered."" Read Hursh's full statement here.

What Does a Live Gig NFT Mean for the Music Industry?;−  1  =  eight            ×  7  =  twenty eight            ×  4  =  20          Photo: Viberate The following partner piece comes from Vasja Veber, co-founder of Viberate. Say what you want about “crypto”, it’s nice to see it in the headlines again, and getting more people interested. We’re one of the survivors of the 2017 ICO hype, so naturally, we’re always looking for new ways to implement NFTs into our platform and business. And, as always, we want to do it our own way. That brought us to creating a token that goes beyond the “collectible item” status – a token holding the rights to book a world-renowned DJ for a live performance. Our upcoming NFT drop will feature five NFTs with UMEK’s work. Specifically, three exclusive remixes of UMEK’s 1999 hit track “Lanicor”, one livestream performance, and one live gig. The owner of UMEK’s NFT will thus either purchase the rights to one of his original remixes, book UMEK for an exclusive online event, or book him for a real-life live performance. Which means, the buyer of such NFT can also be a fan who wants to book UMEK directly for, say, a private party, or show him support. Such opportunities are the ones that excite us the most. We do hope the drop works, because the industry’s been in a sort of limbo this past year, and looking for new ways forward. With no live events, the artists try to make do by streaming their performances, but there’s no clear answer as to when and how things will return to normal – or even what ‘normal’ will mean by then. We hope to prove three points with our NFT drop: that any artist can make sure they have a booking waiting for them once live gigs are back in the picture, that the terms of that booking are securely agreed upon in advance, and that NFTs are a way for fans to support their favorite artists directly and transparently. As for the future, we can say this: if the concept is validated and the industry shows interest, we plan on providing the option of gig token minting to nearly half a million music artists in our Viberate database, along with minting artist ID NFTs through a secure verification process. These ID NFTs will then act as a certificate of authenticity, reassuring the buyer that the contents indeed come from a verified artist, and not someone else selling their content. This is of course just one step in the possible NFT-rich future, so we hope others will join us in making them. UMEK’s NFT drop will launch on Blockparty on Thursday, April 29th, 2021, at 3:00 pm EST (8:00 pm GMT+1).;https://qoo.ly/3bxgfk;

They will share their perspective on themes relating to the film White Riot, namely rebel music, diversity, anti-racism and accountability in the UK in 2021.
This talk will be recorded and you can view it anytime after 6pm. Rock Against Racism was formed in 1976, in reaction to Eric Clapton’s racist rant and his declaration of support for Conservative MP Enoch Powell. White Riot blends fresh interviews with queasy archive footage to reveal a hostile environment of anti-immigrant hysteria and National Front marches. As neo-nazi’s recruited the nation’s youth, Rock Against Racism’s multicultural punk and reggae gigs provided rallying points for resistance. Rock Against Racism was a political and cultural movement which combated the racist attacks that occurred on the streets. They empowered grassroots groups to organise carnivals, tours, gigs and clubs throughout the country that united people of different ethnic backgrounds through a collective love of music. Musicians of all genres were a part of the movement. This event is a collaboration between the De La Warr Pavilion and Izzard Theatre’s Young Film Programmers supported by Film Hub South East.

Viberate Partners with Blockparty for World’s First “Live Gig NFT” - Crypto Daily™;"Advertisement Advertisement Blockchain-based music research and analytics platform Viberate will be the first in the world to launch a special NFT featuring the rights to a live performance and other exclusive content by UMEK, the acclaimed no. 1 Techno producer and DJ. Viberate will be verifying the drop, which will be launched on the Blockparty digital marketplace on April 29 and run for 24 hours. UMEK’s offer will include five different NFTs: three exclusive remixes of his seminal 1999 track “Lanicor”, one livestream performance, and one live gig. The buyers of UMEK’s NFT will thus either purchase the rights to one of his original remixes, book him for an exclusive online event, or book him for a real-life live performance. “We’ve been actively involved in the crypto scene for the last several years,” explains Vasja Veber, one of Viberate’s co-founders and UMEK’s manager. “Our platform includes blockchain and we have our own token (VIB), so tokenizing the rights to a live performance seemed not only the logical next step in the evolution of NFTs, but also an exciting opportunity to explore how the live music industry could handle bookings in the future. We see how tenuous the position of many music artists is today, as there’s been no events to speak of this past year. Being sure there’s a booking waiting for them once the virus is tamed is something many musicians and organizers dream of right now.” Several music artists have already successfully sold their NFTs, either as albums, VIP tickets, digital art or other concepts. UMEK’s upcoming drop is the first to explore new possibilities for musicians to secure and manage their future bookings once live events return. If the concept proves to be successful, Viberate plans on providing the option of gig token minting to nearly half a million artists in its database, along with minting artist ID NFTs through a secure verification process.  UMEK’s NFT drop will launch on Blockparty on Thursday, April 29, 2021, at 8:00 pm GMT+1 (3:00 pm EST).

Popular Searches If you want to firm up your body, head to the gym. If you want to exercise your brain, listen to music. There are few things that stimulate the brain the way music does. If you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool. It provides a total brain workout. Research has shown that listening to music can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory. Experts are trying to understand how our brains can hear and play music. A stereo system puts out vibrations that travel through the air and somehow get inside the ear canal. These vibrations tickle the eardrum and are transmitted into an electrical signal that travels through the auditory nerve to the brain stem, where it is reassembled into something we perceive as music. Johns Hopkins researchers have had dozens of jazz performers and rappers improvise music while lying down inside an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine to watch and see which areas of their brains light up. Music is structural, mathematical and architectural. It’s based on relationships between one note and the next. You may not be aware of it, but your brain has to do a lot of computing to make sense of it. When 13 older adults took piano lessons, their attention, memory and problem-solving abilities improved, along with their moods and quality of life. You don’t have to become a pro, just take a few lessons. The power of music isn’t limited to interesting research. Try these methods of bringing more music—and brain benefits—into your life. Listen to what your kids or grandkids listen to, experts suggest. Often we continue to listen to the same songs and genre of music that we did during our teens and 20s, and we generally avoid hearing anything that’s not from that era. New music challenges the brain in a way that old music doesn’t. It might not feel pleasurable at first, but that unfamiliarity forces the brain to struggle to understand the new sound. Reach for familiar music, especially if it stems from the same time period that you are trying to recall. Listening to the Beatles might bring you back to the first moment you laid eyes on your spouse, for instance. Pay attention to how you react to different forms of music, and pick the kind that works for you. What helps one person concentrate might be distracting to someone else, and what helps one person unwind might make another person jumpy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A large machine that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to see inside your body. Unlike an X-ray, MRI testing does not use radiation. If you undergo this test, you’ll lie on a narrow table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped scanner for about 30 to 60 minutes while health-care professionals watch from another room.

 Communication between the brain's auditory and rew ard circuits is the reason why humans find music rewarding, according to new research published in JNeurosci. Despite no obvious biological benefits, humans love music. Neuroimaging studies highlight similarities between how the brain's reward circuits process music and other rewards like food, money, and alcohol. Yet neuroimaging studies are correlational by nature. In a new study, Mas-Herrero et al. sought to nail down the causal role of this circuitry by using non-invasive brain stimulation. A group of pop music fans listened to a set of pop songs while the research team measured their brain activity with fMRI. Before the scan, the team indirectly excited or inhibited the brain's reward circuit with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Exciting the reward circuit prior to hearing music increased the pleasure participants felt when listening to the songs, while inhibiting it decreased pleasure. These induced pleasure changes were linked to changes in activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key region of the reward circuit. The participants with the greatest difference in pleasure also showed the greatest difference in synchronized activity between auditory and reward regions. These results indicate interactions between auditory and reward regions drive the pleasure we feel when listening to music. Greater induced pleasure differences was associated with increased synchronized activity between auditory and reward regions (credit: Mas-Herrero et al., JNeurosci 2021).  The new paper by Mas-Herrero et al., is entitled ""Unraveling the Temporal Dynamics of Reward Signals in Music-Induced Pleasure with TMS"" was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, the Canada Fund for Innovation, and the CIBC Fellowship in Brain Imaging.  Editor's note: The original material was provided by the Society for Neuroscience. The accuracy of information in this press release is the responsibility of the source, and opinions expressed are not necessarily the views of The Hearing Journal.

Introduction – OPEN SHELF;"By Janneka Guise  In 1921, the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto (which was established in 1918) took over the operation of what was then the Toronto Conservatory of Music’s library.  This year marks our 100th anniversary, and we are grateful to the editors of Open Shelf for the opportunity to document our history, current state and special collections in a series of articles over the coming months. This month, we will introduce the Music Library as it stands today. The Music Library at the University of Toronto is located on the St. George (downtown) campus, inside the Edward Johnson Building (EJB) which houses the Faculty of Music. The EJB is situated inside the triangle created by the Royal Ontario Museum, the Faculty of Law, and Trinity College.  The Library occupies two below-grade levels of the EJB, and we are fortunate to face Philosopher’s Walk, a quiet path that is popular with walkers and joggers. In springtime, library staff and users can enjoy views of the famed blossoms on the cherry trees that line this peaceful walkway. We support the curriculum and research needs of our faculty, staff, and students, and we preserve the musical history of the University and the local community. Ours is the largest music research collection in Canada, with over 350,000 monographs, periodicals and music scores, 200,000+ sound recordings in all formats from wax cylinder to CD, the Olnick Rare Book Room which contains over 2,600 rare items, and hundreds of linear metres of archival collections. Like other types of libraries, the Music Library also has a large collection of e-resources, from e-books and e-journals to streaming audio/video and electronic music scores. To build and maintain these collections, we have a relatively large staff of four professional librarians, an archivist, six library technicians and a dozen student assistants during the academic year.   We moved into our current two-storey space in 1990, and, thanks to a healthy acquisitions budget, our collection exceeds our shelf capacity. In fact, our aisles are so narrow they are not compliant with modern accessibility standards. The crowded stacks are so dark that it’s difficult to read call numbers in many areas. To make room for every new item we purchase, another item must be moved to the University of Toronto Libraries’ off-site, high-density storage facility, UTL @ Downsview. We are living with a legacy decision that sees all newly-purchased music scores sent straight to Downsview. This decision was made to overcome a backlog in the binding and preservation department; new scores get catalogued and sent straight to Downsview prior to being bound. Then, once a patron requests the item, it circulates unbound to that person, then gets routed to the bindery and transferred to the music library.  The unfortunate consequence of this decision is that there are very few music scores on-site with publication dates after 2000.  Since our patrons often browse our stacks to discover new music to play, this apparent lack of contemporary music causes confusion.   Approximately one-third of our circulating and archival collections are housed at Downsview. With its state-of-the-art climate control, well-documented barcoding and retrieval system, and daily deliveries to the St. George campus, Downsview is a wonderful solution to U of T Libraries’ space concerns. However, we want to ensure we are sending the most appropriate materials to Downsview and keeping the most relevant materials on-site. To that end, music library staff have embarked on a large-scale collection assessment. Together with five peer institutions, we are holding a Music Collection Assessment Summit (April 21-23, 2021) to share our work with each other and with interested viewers. All are welcome In subsequent issues of Open Shelf throughout 2021, we will discuss each of our special collections in more depth and outline some of the unique challenges that face music libraries (e.g. cataloguing, collection development, and binding/preservation). The next issue will feature a look back at our 100 year history.  In the meantime, be sure to follow us on Instagram @uoftmusiclib as our expert staff take turns highlighting an item for each of our 100 years from our collections.
 Janneka (Jan) Guise is the Director of the Music Library at the University of Toronto. Prior to joining the U of T in 2017 she was Head of the Eckhardt-Gramatté Music Library at the University of Manitoba for 10 years. She has also worked in academic libraries in Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, and Kansas. Jan has served on the Board of the Canadian Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (CAML) in several capacities and was President from 2011-2013.

Cornell to host virtual remembrance for COVID-19 losses | Mirage News;Over the past year, close to 550,000 people in the U.S. and 2.8 million worldwide have lost their lives due to COVID-19. Restrictions on gathering have deprived countless survivors of chances to mourn, heal and grieve losses, whether from COVID-19 or unrelated causes, with family and friends. To honor these losses and provide opportunity to mourn as a community, the university is hosting the “Cornell COVID-19 Service of Remembrance,” a virtual event on Zoom, Monday, April 19, from noon to 12:45 p.m. Prelude music will begin at 11:50 a.m. The service, which is open to all students, faculty, staff and retirees, will be hosted by Oliver Goodrich, associate dean of students for spirituality and meaning making, and Catherine Thrasher-Carroll, mental health promotion program director. Community members representing the various Cornell constituencies will deliver readings with music from Cornell musicians and other remarks being interspersed. The service is intended to bring Cornellians together in community, in an inclusive, comforting and hopeful atmosphere. The event is nonsectarian and nonpartisan, while acknowledging COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on various communities, such as those of color, people with disabilities, and elders. Mental health resources and other grief supports will be provided at the end of the event. A recording of the service will be shared publicly.;https://www.miragenews.com/cornell-to-host-virtual-remembrance-for-covid-542811/;
Scientists translated the structure of a spider web into music - Tech Explorist;Get the best futuristic stories straight into your inbox before everyone else! Get the best futuristic stories straight into your inbox before everyone else! Making music from spider webs. Spiders make their webs from silk, a natural fiber made of protein. The sturdy, stretchy, sticky silks spun by spiders have inspired engineers to develop several tins. Not only does spider silk combine the valuable properties of high tensile strength and extensibility, but it can also be beautiful in its own right. Recently, scientists reported that that they have created music from a spider web. They translated the structure of a web into music, which could have applications ranging from better 3D printers to cross-species communication and otherworldly musical compositions. Spiders can’t see very well: they sense their world through vibrations with different frequencies. These vibrations occur when the spider stretches a silk strand during construction or when the wind or a trapped fly moves the web. Buehler, who had long been interested in music, wondered if he could extract rhythms and melodies from spider webs. He thought it could be a new source for musical inspiration. Besides, by experiencing a web through hearing and vision, Buehler and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), together with collaborator Tomás Saraceno at Studio Tomás Saraceno, hoped to gain new insights into the 3D architecture and construction of webs. To do so, scientists scanned a natural spider web using laser. They wanted to capture 2D cross-sections. Then, by using computer algorithms, they reconstructed the web’s 3D network. They then assigned different frequencies of sound to strands of the web, creating “notes” that they combined in patterns based on the web’s 3D structure to generate melodies. By creating a harp-like instrument, scientists played spider web music in several live performances around the world. Buehler said, “We made a virtual reality setup that allowed people to visually and audibly “enter” the web. The virtual reality environment is really intriguing because your ears will pick up structural features that you might see but not immediately recognize. By hearing it and seeing it at the same time, you can really start to understand the environment the spider lives in.” Detailed insights on how spiders build webs were gained by scanning a web during the construction process, transforming each stage into music with different sounds. Buehler said, “The sounds our harp-like instrument makes change during the process, reflecting the way the spider builds the web. So, we can explore the temporal sequence of how the web is being constructed in audible form.” “This step-by-step knowledge of how a spider builds a web could help in devising “spider-mimicking” 3D printers that build complex microelectronics. The spider’s way of ‘printing’ the web is remarkable because no support material is used, as is often needed in current 3D printing methods.” Scientists also explored how the sound of a web changes as it’s exposed to different mechanical forces, such as stretching. They found that when pulling the web apart in a VR environment, the strings’ tension and the sound they produce change. At some point, the strands break, and they make a snapping sound. The team is also interested in learning how to communicate with spiders in their language. They recorded web vibrations produced when spiders performed different activities, such as building a web, communicating with other spiders, or sending courtship signals. Although the frequencies sounded similar to the human ear, a machine learning algorithm correctly classified the sounds into different activities. Buehler said, “Now we’re trying to generate synthetic signals to speak the language of the spider. If we expose them to specific rhythms or vibrations, can we affect what they do, and can we begin to communicate with them? Those are fascinating ideas.” Scientists will present their results today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). © All Rights Reserved, Tech Explorist;https://www.techexplorist.com/scientists-translated-structure-spider-web-music/38672/;
The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads - Cognition Today;"Cognition Today

 Home » Social Psychology » The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads Picture this: A bunch of unique-looking headbanging people listening to heavy music; entering a whirlpool of human collision in front of their favorite artist; raising their fists in the air; raising the devil’s horns \m/. What is that all about? Who are they? These are the metalheads. What is their psychology?  We are going to look at the social psychology of heavy metal and rock music fans. In this article, I’ll review the scientific research done on their personality, their behavior, why they do what they do, what they get out it, etc. The effects of heavy metal music can be described through a social-music psychology lens. Let’s look through it.  Heavy metal has many connotations that relate to social psychology. I’ll highlight the most prominent ones here. These come from the heavy metal audience – the musicians as well as the fans.  Brotherhood, Rebellion, Honest Expression, Repression, Outsider, Anger and Aggression, Brutality, Conformity and Non-conformity, Isolation, Depression, Oneness, Homogeneity, Dissolving in the crowd, Respect and Victory, Sincerity and Discipline, Dramatization, and Authority.  These connotations signify something. Heavy metal music caters to some very fundamental feelings and experiences humans have in society. I’ve left out many more connotations that don’t help this post but feel free to take a moment and think. Some of them may contradict each other and that is because heavy metal has many different sub-genres (death metal, thrash metal, power metal, doom metal, etc.) which cater to certain aspects of human experiences.  Positive behavioral outcomes occur when the audience is a fan of metal music. Let’s find out what they are. Just like most other forms of music, people synchronize with each other. Heavy metal relates people to one another and gives existential meaning to many.  Even though people have considered rock music as the devil’s music and opined that this form of music creates negative outcomes like aggression, the story is not that simple. A longitudinal study shows that people who grew up in the 80s and 90s with metal as the popular culture lead healthy and fulfilling lives today. In fact, the research report says that they are better adjusted than non-fans and their metalhead identity serves as a protective barrier against negative life experiences. They also say that participation in fringe cultures can enhance identity development in troubled youth.  While there is a known analogy between bipolar disorders (alternating depression & mania) and heavy metal, there is no known cause-effect between the two. Songs might just reflect the human condition of bipolarity without a direct cause-effect relationship.  Researchers have found that people who are angry and aggressive can experience more positive emotions because of the increased arousal from metal music which matches the person’s physiological state. This congruence between anger/aggression and arousal from metal helps with anger regulation. The popular notion that heavy music makes one angry is not substantiated. In fact, listening to heavy metal may be a healthy way of processing anger.  Go headbang to Megadeth if you want to process anger constructively.  When we look at the stress-reducing capacity of music (as a coping mechanism), for non-fans, classical music and self-chosen music works better than a prescription of heavy metal.  A thesis based on case studies shows that listening to music (heavy metal included) helps people who have been traumatized. It helps them regulate their emotions, overcome suicidal thoughts, and occupy their sensory environment. Extreme forms of music give people a sense of relatability and shared communal support (death metal, doom metal) if they are predisposed to negative outcomes. For example, if someone is already experiencing harsh realities (survival issues, self-harm, abuse) the underlying themes in extreme metal which resonate with those realities provide a sense of relief.  Wait… So far, it looks like metal music is a bed of roses, but it might just be a bed of razors. Research on metal music has one deadly finding to showcase.  Metal music can induce serious amounts of negative emotions and predatory instincts in mice while solving a maze. Mice listening to hard rock music ended up killing each other. While mice who listened to Mozart did not kill each other. Mice who listened to heavier music also took more time solving the maze than mice who listen to classical or no music. The auditory stress of rock music might have pushed the mice into a frenzy. Read about it here: Educational CyberPlayGround.  Humans have an ethics-based guiding system in the brain which makes sure that the strong negative emotional states evoked by metal do not translate into such aggressive behavior as that in mice; at least in well-adjusted humans. Severe personality, mood, and psychotic disorders change the picture completely, and the reactions may not be favorable. It is possible that complex metal music cannot be properly processed by mice and is interpreted as a stressor & a threat.  On similar lines, one study by a road-safety authority found that listening to Slipknot’s (sic) can be detrimental to driving. They explain this as an effect of compromised attention.  I did speak of metal music as a way to combat negative emotions and cope with them, even reduce aggressive tendencies. However, this effect appears to be more in fans than in non-fans. Those who don’t prefer high-intensity metal music have an increase in uneasiness after listening but fans appear to have an increase in positive emotions after listening.  This begs the question – How do other music genres fare in emotion regulation? Emotion regulation is about managing and modifying emotions fruitfully. One paper addressed this question. They found that rock music and heavy metal music is potent for managing negative moods. Jazz, Blues, Classical, Rap, Hip-Hop, Soul, Funk, and Electronic/Dance are potent in both negative and positive mood regulation. While the genre classification is crude in this study, they analyzed broad dimensions of music. They provide evidence for rhythm and energy being the two critical factors in regulating emotions.  A study on the link between mental health and metal fans from France shows that the baseline rates of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicide) are similar to those of the general population; sometimes, even lower. One explanation for this is the power of emotional regulation via metal and the sense of community that comes with the fandom. This is in direct contradiction with the general perception that metalheads are more mentally unstable.  Metal and rock music is diverse with many sub-cultures which have certain characteristics, these characteristics may play a role in explaining some observations of deteriorating mental health. For example, a study found evidence that teens who are heavily associated with a goth sub-culture are at a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Although the link was present, the study doesn’t dish out whether at-risk teens prefer a goth sub-culture or the goth-culture normalizes this behavior. Fun fact: An interesting physics-chemistry-music cross-over study showed that people in a mosh-pit behave like molecules of a gas. Where the act of bumping into one other in a pseudo-random way resembles the mathematical structure of the molecules in a gas. You can read about its implications here: Mosh pit physics could aid disaster planning.  Because the audience is small and the person who likes metal does so at a very personal level, you’ll see that a huge number of metal fans are musicians themselves. Apart from the sound of ‘metal’ being an acquired taste for many, being a musician further bolsters the connotations I mentioned at the start of this post.  A survey-based research study on 414 British undergraduates showed that those who liked metal music tended to be more open to experiences, wanted to be unique, and were not in favor of authority. While this isn’t groundbreaking research, it corroborates people’s narratives about why they like metal.  You might be surprised by how metal music relates to romantic relationships. If your significant other sports a Judas Priest teeshirt, chances are he/she is not going to cheat on you as much as someone sporting jazz music teeshirts. A survey study showed that metalheads were least likely to cheat on their partner and jazz fans were most likely to cheat. Turns out, metalheads are loyal and faithful people. As per musical preferences and lifestyle preferences analyzed in this paper, rock music (not metal, data lacking) fans tend to have fewer sexual partners than fans of dance, house, hip-hop, rap, jazz, and indie music. A whopping 93.5% of metalheads had lesser than 5 sexual partners over a 5-year span.  But doesn’t this romantic faithfulness contradict the very essence of a lot of metal music? After all, metal music has the connotations of defiance, rebellion, and a dislike toward law and authority. Cheating is defined as breaking mutually accepted rules. So it looks like metalheads don’t see romance in a social context that has a governing system that dictates rules. One could speculate that romance/love, for metalheads, is deeply personal and asocial. The mutual rules in romance depend only on the partner(s).  There is this lingering question that many have in mind- Do violent & angry themes in music make a person violent? A study explored this question by testing positive & negative emotions and awareness of violent themes on their mental processing of music. They found that violent music does partially desensitize a person depending on how much they like the music. Non-fans showed an increased negativity bias – selective processing of negative information. This shows that non-fans did amplify the processing of violent themes. Fans did not have this bias in spite of being aware of the violent themes. This is probably due to a) Liking the music, b) Long-term exposure, and c) Evaluating the musical experience as positive.  Heavy metal music is intricate. It is based on the acquisition of skills that take a long time to get refined. It’s a genre that clearly evolved from simple to complex musical structures; mostly bound by guitars, vocals, drums, keyboards, and bass. That is just the nature of natural selection applied to music. When a metal musician makes music, it is the result of years of practice. That entails the discipline of studying, focusing on complicated sounds, sweating, and creating something new. Simply because the musician is involved in such mental and physical activity which costs a lot and often does not yield much monetarily, the musician attaches feelings of ‘sacrifice’ to it. This increases the sense of accomplishment felt by the musician.  I can only imagine that such a routine makes hard-working, sincere, and creative people who are proud of their struggle to make something interesting with music. One important factor is the feedback loop between music and the self. Making structured music will start making the musician structure other things in life. A showy guitarist will most likely be flashy in other parts of his or her life. A person who generally listens to a variety of things would be open-minded in other factors. Whereas an extremely fussy musician will also tend to be fussy about the food he/she eats. These are some likely examples, they are not generalizations.  Metal musicians often make music with other musicians. This is a form of ‘coupling’ or synchronized behavior. Songs sound like songs because of this inherent quality of coupling. Random sounds do not sound like music because they lack coupling. In fact, this coupling is popularly understood as the chemistry between musicians. A study showed how the brains of guitarists who are playing together synchronize their brain waves before the music begins, thereby supporting the idea of this intuitive coupling. Read about it here. When coupled, fans and musicians experience similar emotional states which foster bonding through dedicated systems. These dedicated systems are interesting meta-networks of neurons that fire in a way that mirrors (for lack of a better word) someone else’s behavioral, cognitive, and emotional state. They are associated with observation, mimicking, synchronizing, and understanding different perspectives. They also foster nurturing and companionship which is required for pair-bonding. This musical coupling is likely to make a person more sensitive and empathetic. I’m not talking about mirror neurons, I’m talking about a dozen other networks which explain similar functions in humans.  One research study suggests that the metal ‘gig’ ritual (headbanging included) allows musicians to go in a state of flow. The very act of playing along with a band on stage made a musician more likely to experience flow. Taking a step backward, flow is the mental state where one is completely absorbed in a task and feels one with it. Flow is a positive desirable state because it is connoted by task engagement, a deep connection with the task, intrinsic satisfaction, challenge, and joy.  The curiously interesting bit is that the musicians experience flow in spite of the deeply embedded negative emotional states like anger, frustration, and rebellion in metal music. You can read more about the flow state and how to achieve it here. There certainly are pros and cons observed in heavy metal music-making and listening. And that’s hardly a problem – career difficulties, community building, in-group & out-group aggression, etc. are a part of many sects. You look at any sub-section of society – there will be extreme outliers, quirks, pros, and cons. That’s a discussion more suited to the human condition on the whole than on any form of music.  General life stories of heavy metal fans show:1. Significant emotional depth is added to like-mindedness in music2. There is a phase in their lives where metal music added meaning to their ‘not so pleasant lives.’ 3. Metal becomes an integral part of their lives and the related attitudes and behavior are seen across many facets of their lives including relationships, school, parenthood, etc. These are the reasons metalheads get obsessive about their music as well. Which, sometimes, is unhealthy as they could become dogmatic and disrespectful toward music which isn’t their own.  Although this isn’t a tested hypothesis, I would say that metal music makes people behave in a collective way largely because it is a minority. This is similar to a phenomenon in evolutionary biology called negative frequency-dependent selection. In simple terms, the value of heavy metal is high because of its relatively low frequency in the whole population. That is, heavy metal fans are a minority and heavy metal music is more valuable because it is rare as opposed to pop music – which is, by definition, popular and abundant.  People may slightly overestimate its effects and be biased due to the music being relatively rare. It’s like seeing a person you know in a foreign country, you end up evaluating that person in a more favorable way. Metal music itself is democratic within this minority, fans become musicians and vice-versa. They maintain the genre & subculture by assuming at least one of the two roles. That is why you can say that heavy metal is of the people, by the same people, and for the same people. For those about to rock, we salute you! There is one last thing I’d like to introduce. When you look at a lot of sub-genres of music, the various emotions associated with each sub-genre, and the musical complexity, there is an overarching theme that emerges. This theme is about how metal music evolves alongside people, culture, science, art, technology, and the environment.  The theme has multiple feedback loops & transfer effects – thinking about science could be informed by musical complexity, socio-cultural nuances of metal could inform technological advancement, metal could foster newer public sentiments such as concern for climate change, etc. You can read this paper to know more about the holistic bird’s eye view of how metal music interacts with the human condition.  \m/  Hey!

 Great article Aditya, I really enjoyed reading it. The themes in your paper cover something that I have been thinking about for a while (I have an Art Therapy background and work with children with emotional and behavioural problems) about the psycho-emotional aspects to listening to metal and anger/emotion regulation. I have always dreamed of doing a Quantitative study on it amongst friends hah! Your section on flow catches what my own experiences are with listening to metal music, particularly with lyrics that tap into a certain emotionally charged memory (I’m a massive TOOL fan, as well as Deftones, Mastodon and Messhugah XD). Personally I would definitely support the thesis that listening to music with negative-emotion themes helps process and deal with difficult experiences. Catharsis, similar to the Art Therapy process of pouring and mess-making is very present in Metal music to me.
Again I would say the concept of flow as either an active player or listener at a gig/in-headphones was at times a spiritual experience, like BHarath is saying above, and I think of it as being taken out of your mind and body by the sound and having a feeling of great release at those moments, when certain riffs or lyrical content hits the right nerve. Anyway, great article, thank you very much for posting! Hey Alistair, thank you so much for appreciating my article and sharing your experience! I’m delighted to hear you also think negatively charged themes can help with regulation! Regarding the parallel between mess-making and so-called “noise-making” actually has so much value. Probably not just in regulation & catharsis, but also in creative exploration and accidental discoveries. Certainly, feeling “flow” while listening and/or playing is quite powerful. I personally enjoy listening flow more than playing flow, particularly when I am in an exploratory zone. That complete engagement of your senses when all else drowns out is amazing. Its a Gate way to spirituality (Don’t mistake it for religious) – Spirituality in understanding the oneself (U) so that you could understand everything else.
The Stigma of Metal being Evil or the Devils Music is bullshit – In India Its hard to find one True Metal head (Fan or performer) – Who has the complete understanding of the above and who ha the richness with humility kind of notion. I have literally not met one – and i doubt i would find any; In India, these so called metal heads are either – fools or stupid enough to think they are the best – because of the weird look, (In a way, attraction) a wasted talent, which is called Music; never used with a purpose rather used to show off. Stupid competition of feeling great by stamping an innocent or week. Feeling special for smoking up. Lol.
WHo has no respect for his own culture but curiously and clueless running behind a culture with ZERO wisdom  I have not found one solid Metal head in India. All are so fake – that they can say; they have never heard Bollywood music, MC** are you serious – how much would anyone fake. Just a trying copy of the one already existing.  DOn’t respond to this if you want to prove coz you will never succeed, As an Example – The Indian Heavy Metal Music itself is your answer. It has always been a copy and never authentic … A*** Holes all of them ..  DO you know something – A Character like Bhagath, Bismil, Azad, I am sure if they knew heavy metal existed – They would have been the one.

Hey, thank you so much for thinking about donation, really appreciate your sentiment:) I do have a donate button in the footer section! I’m a 40-year-old Heavy Metal musician and this article basically explains everything that has been going on in my mind since I was 13. If I had to comment on every point and expand it, I could write a book, so I’ll stick to one issue: The apparent contradiction with romantic faithfulness and rebellion. I have always been faithful in relationships, and a rebel all my life. Here’s why: 1. Faithfulness is not about obedience, but loyalty. And while we hate obeying rules, we love loyalty. It’s actually rewarded in the culture (at least it was in my country Malta’s, metal scene)
2. Being a “Metal couple” is in itself an act of rebellion. Though nowadays I’m much more into the music than the fashion, I remember being young and feeling proud that my girlfriend wore studs and Type O Negative t-shirts.
3. The passion for metal, makes the relationship stronger. When I had non-metal girlfriends there were times we ended up talking about the weather. With metal girlfriends, we only talked about the weather if a storm was coming and there was an open-air gig. When you’re young, and you don’t have kids, the passion for metal could be near as bonding as bringing up a child. Thanks for commenting Robert:D The 3 reasons you gave – spot on! Loyalty is a very different concept for us and is completely different from rebellion. I see it rewarded in the Indian metal scene too. I am not really in the scene anymore but can confirm point 2 and 3 anecdotally.  The passion gave me a new way of life after a dull and boring school life!";https://cognitiontoday.com/the-social-psychology-of-heavy-metal-rock-music-research-on-metalheads/;
How Music Empowers | Listening to Modern Rap and Metal;Published March 2021 How Music Empowers argues that empowerment is the key to unlocking the long-standing mystery of how music moves us. Drawing upon cutting-edge research in embodied cognitive science, psychology, and cultural studies, the book provides a new way of understanding how music affects listeners. The argument develops from our latest conceptions of what it is to be human, investigating experiences of listening to popular music in everyday life. Through listening, individuals have the potential to redefine themselves, gain resilience, connect with other people, and make a difference in society. Applying a groundbreaking theoretical framework to postmillennial rap and metal, the book uncovers why vast numbers of listeners engage with music typically regarded as ‘social problems’ or dismissed as ‘extreme’. In the first ever comparative analytical treatment of rap and metal music, twenty songs are analysed as case studies that reveal the empowering potential of listening. The book details how individuals interact with rap and metal communities in a self-perpetuating process which keeps these thriving music cultures – and the listeners themselves – alive and well. J Hurley and Ben Marvin of rap metal band Hacktivist (photo: Henry Laurisch) How Music Empowers will interest scholars and researchers of popular music, music theory, ethnomusicology, music psychology, music therapy, and music education. The hardback and ebook are available now from Routledge (Taylor & Francis) and other retailers. The first analysis in the book looks at the track ‘Bars Simzson’, arguing that the rapper performs as a model of individual empowerment. © Frank Schwichtenberg / CC BY-SA 4 Informed by online commentary, an analysis of ‘Here To Stay’ explains how listeners can gain feelings of resilience. © pitpony.photography / CC-BY-SA-3.0 In Chapter 4 of the book, the iconic Kanye West production ‘Get By’ is examined to show how music teaches us to overcome difficult social circumstances. © Joe Cereghino / CC BY 2.0 The song ‘Cthulhu Dawn’ is used to see how fantastical accounts of apocalyptic events help listeners imagine a freer and fairer society.   © Vassil / CC BY-SA 3 The fan community of hip-hop collective Brockhampton provides a case study of how listeners find communal empowerment through engagement with the group’s multimedia output. © Nicolas Padovani / CC BY 2.0 Dr. Steven Gamble is a researcher of popular music based at University College Cork (Ireland).

"Mason Gross Musicians To Present ""A Celebration of Women in Music"" on April 18";(NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ) -- Mason Gross musicians are set to perform a Facebook Premiere concert featuring instrumental and vocal works composed by women. A Celebration of Women in Music, an annual concert that, this year, also will be a collaboration between the university’s Women in Art Music Research Group (WAM) and the Douglass Residential College, will take place on Sunday, April 18, 2021 from 5:00pm to 7:00pm.   The event will be available to the public free of charge through the Mason Gross School’s Facebook page and will feature works by Fanny Mendelssohn, Germaine Tailleferre, Caroline Shaw, and Margaret Bonds, among others. Viewers are welcome to join the performers for a post-performance Zoom conversation curated by the WAM Research Group, made up of Rutgers undergraduate musicians and musicologists interested in exploring and amplifying women’s participation in the classical music sphere, as performers, copyists, instrument builders, and composers, among other roles. Registration for the post-performance moderated conversation is available here.   Music faculty member Rebecca Cypess, also advisor of the WAM research group and associate dean for Academic Affairs at Mason Gross, has helped organize the concert for the last three years.   “We started this initiative as part of a larger project to increase understanding of women's contributions to musical culture,” says Cypess, who has devoted much of her own musicological research to the role of women in music history. “We’ve been thrilled to see how the concert has grown: Each year we have more and more students volunteering to participate, and the energy builds on itself. Students actively seek to prepare music by women composers in their lessons, and the repertoire becomes embedded into the everyday culture of the department. This, after all, is what we want: that music by women become a normal component of students’ experiences.”  Cody Grabbe, director of Experiential Education and Academic Programs at Douglass Residential College, says the concert naturally dovetails with DRC’s longstanding mission.  “As part of our collective efforts advancing women in all disciplines, Douglass supports performers from Mason Gross in engaging the greater Rutgers and Central New Jersey communities as they share music written by composers who are women in celebrating their works and the talents of the performers we have on campus,” Grabbe says.  Organizing the concert is a critical aspect of WAM’s work, says Grace Gardner, a student in the research group who has helped shape the program for this year’s concert. “In working to make musical study and performance more inclusive, we must both actively create platforms to showcase underrepresented musicians as well as normalize the integration of diverse repertoire in non-specialized settings,” she says. This annual celebration, Gardner adds, is a way to “provide and maintain a space for this work while also taking the next step in encouraging our community to bring diverse music into their own practices.”   Special thanks to the donors to Douglass Residential College, the Douglass Fund, and the Associate Alumnae of Douglass College (AADC) for their contributions that have made this concert and program possible.   About the Music Department  The mission of the Music Department at Mason Gross School of the Arts is to develop well-educated professional musicians who have a deep historical and theoretical understanding of all aspects of music.

Popular Searches If you want to firm up your body, head to the gym. If you want to exercise your brain, listen to music. There are few things that stimulate the brain the way music does. If you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool. It provides a total brain workout. Research has shown that listening to music can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory. Experts are trying to understand how our brains can hear and play music. A stereo system puts out vibrations that travel through the air and somehow get inside the ear canal. These vibrations tickle the eardrum and are transmitted into an electrical signal that travels through the auditory nerve to the brain stem, where it is reassembled into something we perceive as music. Johns Hopkins researchers have had dozens of jazz performers and rappers improvise music while lying down inside an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine to watch and see which areas of their brains light up. Music is structural, mathematical and architectural. It’s based on relationships between one note and the next. You may not be aware of it, but your brain has to do a lot of computing to make sense of it. When 13 older adults took piano lessons, their attention, memory and problem-solving abilities improved, along with their moods and quality of life. You don’t have to become a pro, just take a few lessons. The power of music isn’t limited to interesting research. Try these methods of bringing more music—and brain benefits—into your life. Listen to what your kids or grandkids listen to, experts suggest. Often we continue to listen to the same songs and genre of music that we did during our teens and 20s, and we generally avoid hearing anything that’s not from that era. New music challenges the brain in a way that old music doesn’t. It might not feel pleasurable at first, but that unfamiliarity forces the brain to struggle to understand the new sound. Reach for familiar music, especially if it stems from the same time period that you are trying to recall. Listening to the Beatles might bring you back to the first moment you laid eyes on your spouse, for instance. Pay attention to how you react to different forms of music, and pick the kind that works for you. What helps one person concentrate might be distracting to someone else, and what helps one person unwind might make another person jumpy.

Can York academics win this year’s AI Song Contest? | Mirage News;A team of researchers from the University of York have submitted an entry to this year’s AI Song Contest. The human-AI band ‘The elephants and the’ wrote and recorded this year’s entry called ‘Circus’. Credit: Lynette Quek The contest, hosted by the Dutch public broadcaster VPRO, aims to show whether AI can help humans compose songs to match the success of song contest hits such as Bucks Fizz’s ‘Making your mind up’. The human-AI band ‘The elephants and the’ – consisting of academics from the Music, Science and Technology Research Cluster in the Department of Music – wrote and recorded this year’s entry called ‘Circus’.  Algorithms The band used algorithms written by the academics to create the piece. Dr Tom Collins’ algorithm provided melodies, chords, basslines and drum beats, while Alex (Zongyu) Yin trained an algorithm to generate lyrics based on snippets of instrumental audio.  Jemily Rime provided the vocals and co-wrote the song using the AI outputs, while Mark Hanslip created a dataset of saxophone riffs from which new saxophone material was generated using a neural network, meaning the song contains the world’s first tonal AI riff and solo generated in the waveform domain. Dr Liam Maloney arranged and produced the track, and Dr Lynette Quek worked on the AI-generated video. Dr Tom Collins, from the Department of Music at the University of York, said: “This was a team effort which drew on a range of expertise. When people reflect on this period in music history, the use of AI to augment human creativity will be a defining characteristic. It’s great to be pioneering this new era of music in the Department of Music at the University of York.” Vote ‘Circus’ will compete with entries submitted from over 20 countries from around the world. Each participating team will be awarded two sets of points: one a public vote by the contest’s international audience, the other by an expert jury.  All entries will be released on 1 June 2021 for public listening and voting, and the winners will be announced in July. The public can now register on the band’s webpage to receive an email as soon as the song is released.  For a sneak preview of ‘Circus’, tune into the ONE show at 7pm 21 May on BBC 1 where the team will be discussing the use of AI in the creation of music.;https://www.miragenews.com/can-york-academics-win-this-years-ai-song-563791/;

Please get in touch with Rosemary: r.l.hill@hud.ac.uk. Hosts University of Huddersfield’s Popular Music Studies Research Group and the Centre for Music Culture and Identity in collaboration with the International Association for the Study of Popular Music's (IASPM), UK & Ireland branch. This event follows on from our earlier successful events: the ‘Practice Based and Led Popular Music Studies Research Symposium’ (2017) and the ‘Crosstown Traffic’ conference (2018).  Timetable We would like you to join us for the whole event, sharing in the discussion across disciplinary boundaries and areas of interest. Questions and further enquiries Dr Rosemary Hill (R.L.Hill@hud.ac.uk): Director of the Popular Music Studies Research Group, University of Huddersfield. Dr Jan Herbst (J.Herbst@hud.ac.uk): Director of the Centre for Music, Culture and Identity, University of Huddersfield. Abstracts Laina Dawes: Fugitive Ontology and Black Static: Afro-Pessimism vs. Afro-Futurism in Popular Music In “Grammar & Ghosts: The Performative Limits of African Freedom” Frank B. Wilderson believes that it is impossible for Black artists to declare themselves as “artists,” outside of racial categorization, which he describes as an “outdated dependency on outdated notions of a unitary self.” How does this theory function within a colonized and Westernized popular music culture?  This presentation will center on the similarities between music created within an Afro-futuristic lens, which posits that people of the African diasporas has have a constant presence in the future, and Afro-pessimism, which, among other ideas, argues that white supremacy has hindered any opportunities for Black artists to fully individualize their artistic endeavours on their own terms. I will argue that for Black artists within alternative forms of popular music, they can benefit from both theories of thought based on their participation within music culture. Laina Dawes is a Ph.D. Candidate in Ethnomusicology at Columbia University. She is also the author of What Are You Doing Here? A Black Woman’s Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal (Bazillion Points, 2013; 2020). She also has a Masters in Liberal Studies from the New School for Social Research (2015). Recent publications include contributions to Fade To Grey: Androgyny, Art and Style In 80s Dance Music (2021) and Metallica FAQ: All That’s Left to Know About the Greatest Metal Band of All Time (2021). Originally from Toronto, Canada she currently resides in New York City where she runs Women CLAP BACK in the Alternative Arts, producing speaking events and panels for women of color involved in New York's alternative art and music industries.   Steve Waksman: Rock, Rap, and Race in the U.S. Concert Industry From the late 1960s into the 1970s, arena concerts emerged as the cornerstone of a move to industrialize the production of U.S. live music that was unprecedented in its scope. During this era, although arenas were used to host concerts by a range of performers representing diverse popular music genres, the trend became most identified with rock, such that “arena rock” became the default term. More than a simple descriptive category, “arena rock” also encapsulated the biases built into the growing concert industry, especially concerning the push of black music artists to the margins. This tendency continued into the next decade and informed the concert industry’s reception and treatment of rap music as it began to gain an increasing commercial foothold by the mid- to late 1980s. While rap record sales grew, rap concerts remained difficult to produce due to industry resistance and public outcry about the purported lack of safety that became associated with music events that drew majority black (and specifically, black youth) audiences. Rap artists, in turn, struggled to develop strategies to navigate this contested terrain so that they could reach their audiences on stage as well as on record. In this presentation, I will briefly survey the rise of “arena rock” before turning to the subsequent rise of “arena rap,” a less often studied phenomenon. Using the performance career of premier rap group Public Enemy, I will examine how rap artists made strategic alliance with their white rock artist counterparts to gain access to performance venues and opportunities that would otherwise have remained closed to them. The presentation will conclude by addressing the question of how much the U.S. concert industry has become more inclusive in recent decades with regard to the promotion of black performers. Steve Waksman is Sylvia Dlugasch Bauman Professor of American Studies and Professor of Music at Smith College. His publications include the books Instruments of Desire: The Electric Guitar and the Shaping of Musical Experience (1999), and This Ain’t the Summer of Love: Conflict and Crossover in Heavy Metal and Punk (2009). With Reebee Garofalo, he is the co-author of the sixth edition of the rock history textbook, Rockin’ Out: Popular Music in the U.S.A. (2014), and with Andy Bennett, he co-edited the SAGE Handbook of Popular Music (2015). Currently, he is completing a book on the cultural history of live music and performance in the U.S. titled Live Music in America: A History from Jenny Lind to Jay-Z, which is forthcoming from Oxford University Press.  Paula Wolfe: Songwriting, Music Production, Self-Production: Locating the Emotion, Maintaining the Objective, Positioning Genre I have often found that the field of poetry offers many useful analogies when thinking about songwriting and music production in popular music, most especially when thinking about self-production. In recent months I have been reminded of William Wordsworth’s famous proclamation that “Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility”, published in his Preface to the 2nd Edition of Lyrical Ballads (1800). The reason for this is that, throughout the lock-down, I have been obliged to re-work my early work, as part of the forthcoming re-issue of my back catalogue, due to some technical issues highlighted by the remastering process. What at first appeared an onerous task, necessitating delaying work on my fourth album and other creative projects, has proved to be in fact, a highly valuable process. The requisite second round of ‘recollecting’, of reworking ideas whilst maintaining faithfulness to the emotional source of ‘origin’, has served to shine a spotlight on some key aspects about the self-production process and what it offers our understanding of creative processes more generally. Progressing the research in Women In The Studio (2020) that examined the situation of music production and gender and the impact of the historical and contemporaneous gendering of the field, this presentation draws on current work and its accompanying observations in order to position song when considering some of the key distinctions between the music production process and the self-production process. Dr Paula Wolfe is a critically acclaimed singer-songwriter and producer and researcher in the fields of music production, the independent music industry and gender. Nominated for The Excellence in Historical Recorded Sound Research Award 2020, from the Association for Recorded Sound (ARSC), and the IASPM Book Prize 2021, her book, Women in The Studio: Creativity, Control and Gender in Popular Music Sound Production (Routledge 2020), sets to explore the cultural and historical frameworks that underpin the sustained inequalities of gender, class and race in the music industry and pays particular attention to their consequences for female music producers and for female self-producing artists.  As an artist, self-producing and self-releasing on her own label since the early noughties, Wolfe has consistently received strong support. Her third album White Dots (Sib Records 2019) has been hailed ‘exquisite’, ‘glorious’ and ‘addictive’ (* * * * MOJO) and a ‘joyful soul pop follow-up’ (LOB) to her critically acclaimed 2009 Lemon (* * * * Mojo, * * * Uncut, * * * Maverick). It has seen her positioned as ‘The multi-hyphenate in excellent form’ (Mike Davies, FOLKING.COM) and compared to many of our greats. She has been described as ‘a latter-day Carole King’ (LOB) and ‘part Kirsty MacColl’ (Nick Hutchings, VELVET SHEEP), whilst for others her songs recall ‘the eloquence of Ray Davies and Paul Weller in their pomp’ married with ‘the spirit of Lily Allen and Laura Marling’ (Mike Adams, TRAVELLERS TUNES).

Do Dogs Like Music? Research Says YES! - Okoa Pet;"June 11, 2020 As you drag through a long, boring workday or a monotonous car ride, what do you do to lift your mood? Turn up your favorite tunes, of course! Just as you can use music to soothe your soul, you can use the power of song to help your dog get through tough times.  They don’t understand the lyrics, and they don’t know how to dance, so how can we be so sure that dogs actually do like music?  We cannot ask our dogs how music affects them, and which genres touch their soul the most. However, researchers have found creative ways to measure the canine response to different tunes.  Researchers can measure a dog’s pulse before, during, and after a performance to see which tunes slow their heart rate. They can also measure cortisol concentration in the saliva to see which genres are best at de-stressing anxious dogs.  Remember, science is not just about researchers in labs with control groups and fancy equipment. Observing your dog’s reactions to music can be a fun at-home science experiment. You can learn what your dog likes best, and even compile a playlist of tunes for them.  There have been a few research studies that suggest that classical music has a calming effect on dogs in shelters. Dogs in shelters and kennels tend to be more stressed than dogs who live in their forever homes. This is because of the lack of individual attention, the noisy environment, and the cumulative stress between the dogs around them.  However, these studies also show that, over time, the dogs become habituated to calming classical tunes. In fact, they eventually return to the high-stress levels they experienced before the introduction of music to their facility. A more recent study, conducted in 2017 at the Scottish SPCA, found that dogs respond to many genres of music, namely soft rock and reggae. Researchers also found that varying up the types of music can prevent habituation over time.  So, while low, slow tunes can slow the tempo of your dog’s heart rate, don’t be afraid to mix up their playlist.  While you may not have the means to measure cortisol concentrations in your dog’s saliva, you can still analyze how they respond to different songs.  The best way is just to watch your dog’s body language.  What types of music make your dog feel playful? When you discover music that calms your dog, you can use it to help combat separation anxiety. Music can also help them cope with long car rides or other stressful situations. If music alone isn’t enough to calm your stressed pup, consider trying a supplement formulated to support relaxation for your four-legged friend.  Okoa Pet’s “Hush, Puppy” calming chews are formulated with naturally calming ingredients including broad-spectrum hemp with naturally occurring CBD, chamomile, tryptophan, and choline.

Collections Carousel – Colleen: An Irish Love Song – Morrison County Historical Society;"Tweets by weymu February’s extended cold streak in Minnesota had us desperately searching the museum collections for signs of spring. With high temperatures hovering in the low teens below zero to windchills nearing minus forty, any sign was welcome. This piece of sheet music, “Colleen: An Irish Love Song,” with its hints of St. Patrick’s Day in both lyrics and graphics fit the bill and maybe brought good luck. Temperatures have recently been reaching into the 30s and there are even hints of 40 for tomorrow. Among a collection of nearly 150 pieces of sheet music belonging to Anna Olsson Tranberg Coen (1891-1976) of Little Falls, the lyrics in the song are filled with thoughts of spring: “Colleen, Colleen, fairest of flowers on this Isle of Green….Flowers and trees, birds on the breeze all know your beauty and seem ill at ease – Others there be, I only see! One little Colleen, in this world for me!” Anna and her family lived across the street from Pine Grove Park, a fifty-five acre natural park on the west side of Little Falls. Anna and her husband, Melvin, had one child Virginia Louise. Virginia died in 1952, three years after her father’s death. The donor purchased the sheet music collection at Anna’s auction and donated them to MCHS in 2003. “Colleen” was produced in 1903 by the Whitney-Warner Publishing Company of Detroit, Michigan, and New York, New York. The company manufactured photo postcards and other paper-based products. “Colleen” was one of thousands of pieces of music published by the company.

Bookseller Code (AE) What is it that drives people to undertake music research? Such interest frequently grows from on-the-ground experiences as learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively, educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine the direction of the research to be undertaken.Performing Music Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting, analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin research in music education, psychology, and performance science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their research questions, select methods that are appropriate for addressing their questions, and apply those methods systematically and rigorously. Each chapter contains a study guide, comprising a chapter summary, a list of keywords, and suggestions for further discussion, and the book concludes with a resources section, including a glossary and supplementary material to support advanced statistical analysis.The book''s companion website provides information designed to facilitate access to original research and to testknowledge and understanding.

Alzheimer’s patients and hospital staff prescribed music in NHS trial | Medical research | The Guardian;Exclusive: playlist based on listeners’ backgrounds and tastes found to lower heart rate, agitation and distress Bob Marley knew it when he sang on Trenchtown Rock: “One good thing about music when it hits you, you feel no pain.” Now trials are under way at an NHS trust to see if an algorithm can curate music playlists to reduce suffering in Alzheimer’s patients as well as in stressed medical staff. A test among people with dementia found an algorithm that “prescribes” songs based on listeners’ personal backgrounds and tastes resulted in reductions in heart rate of up to 22%, lowering agitation and distress in some cases. This week, Lancashire teaching hospitals NHS trust is extending trials to medical staff who worked in critical care during Covid to see if it can ease anxiety and stress. It is also planning to test it on recovering critical care patients, needle-phobic children and outpatients coping with chronic pain in the hope of reducing opiate prescriptions. The technology operates as a musical “drip”, playing songs to patients and monitoring their heart rates as they listen. A 90-year-old might be prescribed big band music, while a 50-year-old might get a dose of Van Halen and Paul McCartney. An algorithm allows the software, which is linked to a streaming service like Spotify, to change forthcoming tracks if the prescription doesn’t appear to be working. Its artificial intelligence system assesses the “DNA” of songs, examining 36 different qualities including tempo, timbre, key, time signatures, the amount of syncopation and the lowest notes. Gary Jones, the chief executive of MediMusic, the company developing the software, said these were among the factors that can shape the heart rate and blood pressure response to a track. A trial of 25 people with Alzheimer’s aged from their 60s, to their 90s conducted at the Lancashire NHS trust has shown some promising results, the trust said. “There has been an up to 22% reduction in heart rates in these patients,” said Dr Jacqueline Twamley, academic research and innovation manager. “Some people it doesn’t affect the heart rate at all, but you can see the effect in their facial expressions and in them tapping along. One patient burst out crying. He said the song brought back happy memories and they were happy tears.” The playlist of a patient in their 60s included Mull of Kintyre by Wings and Peter Gabriel’s Solsbury Hill, said Twamley, adding: “I thought Mull of Kintyre would increase agitation, but that’s a matter of taste.” When Twamley tried it, she was surprised to see the algorithm prescribed her songs by Gloria Estefan, the Pretenders, Lionel Richie and Billy Ocean. She is a fan of more raucous bands including Led Zeppelin, Queens of the Stone Age and the niche progressive rock outfit Porcupine Tree. But it still had an effect. “I was quite stressed at the beginning of it, but I just felt calm afterwards,” she said. The system aims to select songs that create a gradation in heart rate, starting with something bracing like Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture and moving towards a lullaby. The technology aims to build on research showing the effectiveness of using music to manage chronic pain and on managing anxiety and depression in dementia patients. It tailors its playlist in part by scanning the user’s music preferences based on the listening patterns recorded on their streaming service, if they have one. It also examines their age, gender, nationality, and ethnicity. Jones said a calming track would often have a major key, would be relatively slow and with spaced out instrumentation. The system is aware that music can be upsetting too. There are “red flag tracks” that are filtered out if the patient fears they may trigger upset by reminding them of a traumatic event. And if Twamley or anyone else, really doesn’t want to hear Mull of Kintyre when they are trying to reduce their blood pressure, they can put their own red flag in it. The playlists are intended to start with more energy, becoming calmer to lower the heart rate. They are tailored to broad demographic categories as well as personal listening habits and preferences. These are highlights of three lists produced by the algorithm: For a 90-year-old white British womanTeresa Brewer – Music! Music! Music!Bing Crosby – Galway BayFrank Sinatra – Among My SouvenirsFor a 60-year-old woman of British Indian originMere Dil Mein Aaj Kya Hai – Rajesh Khanna, Sharmila Tagore, Kishore KumarPyaasa – Geeta Dutt & Mohd RafiLag Jaa Gale – Sadhana, Lata MangeshkarFor a 40-year-old black British man with interest in soul, R&B hip-hop and popThe Notorious B.I.G. – Mo Money Mo ProblemsAshanti – FoolishFugees – Killing Me Softly With His Song;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/05/alzheimers-patients-and-hospital-staff-prescribed-music-in-nhs-trial;

City Life Org - Grammy Museum® Grant Program Awards $220,000 for Music Research and Sound Preservation;"FUNDS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ARCHIVING AND PRESERVATION PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH EFFORTS THAT EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF MUSIC ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The GRAMMY Museum® Grant Program announced that $220,000 in grants will be awarded to 12 recipients in the United States to help facilitate a range of research on a variety of subjects, as well as support a number of archiving and preservation programs. “This year marks the 34th year that the GRAMMY Museum and Recording Academy have partnered to provide much deserved funding for music research and preservation projects across the United States and Canada. During that time, we have awarded more than $7.7 million to nearly 450 grantees,” said Michael Sticka, President of the GRAMMY Museum. “As an educational and cultural nonprofit institution, we know firsthand how critical grant funding is in order to deliver measurable results and impact through our mission. This is why we’re proud to support these impressive projects that are at the intersection of music and science, and work to maintain our shared musical legacy for generations to come.” Generously funded by the Recording Academy, the GRAMMY Museum Grant Program provides funding annually to organizations and individuals to support efforts that advance the archiving and preservation of the recorded sound heritage of the Americas for future generations, in addition to research projects related to the impact of music on the human condition. In 2008, the Grant Program expanded its categories to include assistance grants for individuals and small to mid-sized organizations to aid collections held by individuals and organizations that may not have access to the expertise needed to create a preservation plan. The assistance planning process, which may include inventorying and stabilizing a collection, articulates the steps to be taken to ultimately archive recorded sound materials for future generations. The deadline each year for submitting letters of inquiry to the Grant Program is Oct. 15. Guidelines and the letter of inquiry form for the 2022 cycle will soon be available at www.grammymuseum.org. Scientific Research Grantees UC San Diego — La Jolla, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 How can we use music to reduce conflict? This project designs and tests a novel music-based intervention to counter dehumanization of marginalized groups, leveraging the finding that learning about others’ musicality leads us to judge others more sensitive, intelligent and wrong to harm. Using a randomized controlled trial and a pre-post design, researchers test whether learning about the musicality of marginalized individuals can reduce dehumanization. University of South Florida — Tampa, Fla. Awarded: $20,000 Older musicians show enhanced auditory memory and verbal fluency; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits are unknown. This project aims to: (i) assess older musicians’ ability to minimize overlap between similar sound object representation, a process known as “pattern separation,” and (ii) examine how pattern separation relates to verbal fluency and auditory memory. Understanding training benefits will foster novel music programs for adults. Temple University — Philadelphia, Pa. Awarded: $20,000 This project will test a new music-based measure for profoundly brain-damaged children who are minimally responsive. A correlational study will test the reliability, validity and diagnostic capability of the Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness (MuSICCA). This first standardized measure for pediatric profound brain injury will significantly impact patients, families and professionals, and establish tools for future research. University of Tennessee — Memphis, Tenn. Awarded: $15,000 For cochlear implant (CI) users, the degraded CI signal makes it difficult for them to enjoy music, potentially impacting quality of life. This project will create a validated tool, the Survey of Music Enjoyment, that can be used by clinicians and researchers to investigate factors leading to, and neural substrates linked with, music enjoyment. Using this tool, researchers will examine differences between prelingually and postlingually deafened CI users. Windsor University, Drummer Mechanics & Ergonomics Research Laboratory (DRUMMER Lab) — Windsor, Ontario Awarded: $20,000 Drum set educators play a vital role in promoting healthy behaviors in their students, yet few drummers report having been trained in the prevention of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). This project will explore the reasons why drum set educators do (or do not) teach PRMD prevention. The results will guide the creation of resources to empower instructors to develop or enhance this aspect of their curricula. Preservation Assistance Grantees Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project — Philadelphia, Pa. Awarded: $5,000 The Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project, through its fiscal sponsor, Ars Nova Workshop, will assess, prioritize and plan the digitization, preservation and dissemination of recordings and archival materials surveyed in the Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project, the broader goal of which is to establish a Philadelphia Jazz Archives to document and preserve the city’s extraordinary jazz history. Preservation Implementation The Apollo Theater Foundation, Inc. — New York Awarded: $20,000 The Frank Schiffman Apollo Theater Collection in the archives of the National Museum of American History (NMAH) consists of unique artifacts (photographs, business records and press clippings) spanning the theater’s opening through the mid-1970s. The Apollo aims to further collaborate with NMAH to digitize these materials, fill in gaps in the Apollo’s digital archive, and preserve these priceless objects for future generations of music enthusiasts. Arhoolie Foundation — El Cerrito, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 The Arhoolie Foundation will digitize Chris Strachwitz rare recordings of performances, festivals and concerts from 1950 to 2000. The recordings cover genres such as blues, Cajun, zydeco, gospel, jazz, Tejano/Norteño, sacred steel, Klezmer, tamburitza, old-time, and other tradition-based styles; while artists include Lightnin’ Hopkins, Big Mama Thornton, Fred McDowell, Flaco Jiménez, Ry Cooder, Lydia Mendoza, Lowell Fulson, BeauSoleil, Tampa Red, Reverend Gary Davis, Rose Maddox, and others. Berkeley Society for the Preservation of Traditional Music dba Freight & Salvage — Berkeley, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 The Freight & Salvage will continue preservation of performance recordings dated 1969 to 1989. This phase represents 30 percent of 2,500 recordings featuring historic musicianship collected over their 52-year history. Finalizing analog formats, this project will begin transferring recordings dated 1989 to 1999 to include early digital formats, e.g., DAT and CDR. Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum— Nashville, Tenn. Awarded: $20,000 The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum will assess, catalog and rehouse approximately 1,250 (1-sided) 11″ shellac and vinyl discs that comprise its essential body of test pressings donated by pioneering record producer, A&R man and Country Music Hall of Fame member Arthur “Uncle Art” Satherley. The Collection comprises rare, fragile and historically significant recordings – including a number of potentially unissued recordings. University of California, Los Angeles — Los Angeles Awarded: $20,000 UCLA Film & Television Archive will digitize, restore and preserve three rare classic Hollywood musical short subjects: Tall Tales (1940), Lucky Millinder And His Orchestra (1946) and Sweet Shoe (1937). These three shorts serve as critical examples of early race integration in the genre, and include historically significant performances with rare appearances from influential African American figures. University of Toronto Scarborough— Toronto, Ontario Awarded: $20,000 Support from the GRAMMY Museum will enable the preservation of the largest known cache of field recordings of traditional French-Canadian instrumental music from Quebec. From 1965 to 1975, folklorist Jean Trudel recorded musicians at festivals, concerts, dances, and in their own homes. The grantee will digitize 107 audio and 103 video recordings made by Trudel and designated for inclusion in the National Collection of the Canadian Museum of History.

In 2008, the Grant Program expanded its categories to include assistance grants for individuals and small to mid-sized organizations to aid collections held by individuals and organizations that may not have access to the expertise needed to create a preservation plan. The assistance planning process, which may include inventorying and stabilizing a collection, articulates the steps to be taken to ultimately archive recorded sound materials for future generations. The deadline each year for submitting letters of inquiry to the Grant Program is Oct. 15. Guidelines and the letter of inquiry form for the 2022 cycle will soon be available at www.grammymuseum.org. Scientific Research Grantees UC San Diego — La Jolla, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 How can we use music to reduce conflict? This project designs and tests a novel music-based intervention to counter dehumanization of marginalized groups, leveraging the finding that learning about others' musicality leads us to judge others more sensitive, intelligent and wrong to harm. Using a randomized controlled trial and a pre-post design, researchers test whether learning about the musicality of marginalized individuals can reduce dehumanization. University of South Florida — Tampa, Fla. Awarded: $20,000 Older musicians show enhanced auditory memory and verbal fluency; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits are unknown. This project aims to: (i) assess older musicians' ability to minimize overlap between similar sound object representation, a process known as ""pattern separation,"" and (ii) examine how pattern separation relates to verbal fluency and auditory memory. Understanding training benefits will foster novel music programs for adults. Temple University — Philadelphia, Pa. Awarded: $20,000 This project will test a new music-based measure for profoundly brain-damaged children who are minimally responsive. A correlational study will test the reliability, validity and diagnostic capability of the Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness (MuSICCA). This first standardized measure for pediatric profound brain injury will significantly impact patients, families and professionals, and establish tools for future research. University of Tennessee — Memphis, Tenn. Awarded: $15,000 For cochlear implant (CI) users, the degraded CI signal makes it difficult for them to enjoy music, potentially impacting quality of life. This project will create a validated tool, the Survey of Music Enjoyment, that can be used by clinicians and researchers to investigate factors leading to, and neural substrates linked with, music enjoyment. Using this tool, researchers will examine differences between prelingually and postlingually deafened CI users. Windsor University, Drummer Mechanics & Ergonomics Research Laboratory (DRUMMER Lab) — Windsor, Ontario Awarded: $20,000 Drum set educators play a vital role in promoting healthy behaviors in their students, yet few drummers report having been trained in the prevention of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). This project will explore the reasons why drum set educators do (or do not) teach PRMD prevention. The results will guide the creation of resources to empower instructors to develop or enhance this aspect of their curricula. Preservation Assistance Grantees Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project — Philadelphia, Pa. Awarded: $5,000 The Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project, through its fiscal sponsor, Ars Nova Workshop, will assess, prioritize and plan the digitization, preservation and dissemination of recordings and archival materials surveyed in the Philadelphia Jazz Legacy Project, the broader goal of which is to establish a Philadelphia Jazz Archives to document and preserve the city's extraordinary jazz history. Preservation Implementation The Apollo Theater Foundation, Inc. — New York Awarded: $20,000 The Frank Schiffman Apollo Theater Collection in the archives of the National Museum of American History (NMAH) consists of unique artifacts (photographs, business records and press clippings) spanning the theater's opening through the mid-1970s. The Apollo aims to further collaborate with NMAH to digitize these materials, fill in gaps in the Apollo's digital archive, and preserve these priceless objects for future generations of music enthusiasts. Arhoolie Foundation — El Cerrito, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 The Arhoolie Foundation will digitize Chris Strachwitz rare recordings of performances, festivals and concerts from 1950 to 2000. The recordings cover genres such as blues, Cajun, zydeco, gospel, jazz, Tejano/Norteño, sacred steel, Klezmer, tamburitza, old-time, and other tradition-based styles; while artists include Lightnin’ Hopkins, Big Mama Thornton, Fred McDowell, Flaco Jiménez, Ry Cooder, Lydia Mendoza, Lowell Fulson, BeauSoleil, Tampa Red, Reverend Gary Davis, Rose Maddox, and others. Berkeley Society for the Preservation of Traditional Music dba Freight & Salvage — Berkeley, Calif. Awarded: $20,000 The Freight & Salvage will continue preservation of performance recordings dated 1969 to 1989. This phase represents 30 percent of 2,500 recordings featuring historic musicianship collected over their 52-year history. Finalizing analog formats, this project will begin transferring recordings dated 1989 to 1999 to include early digital formats, e.g., DAT and CDR. Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum— Nashville, Tenn. Awarded: $20,000 The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum will assess, catalog and rehouse approximately 1,250 (1-sided) 11"" shellac and vinyl discs that comprise its essential body of test pressings donated by pioneering record producer, A&R man and Country Music Hall of Fame member Arthur ""Uncle Art"" Satherley. The Collection comprises rare, fragile and historically significant recordings – including a number of potentially unissued recordings. University of California, Los Angeles — Los Angeles Awarded: $20,000 UCLA Film & Television Archive will digitize, restore and preserve three rare classic Hollywood musical short subjects: Tall Tales (1940), Lucky Millinder And His Orchestra (1946) and Sweet Shoe (1937). These three shorts serve as critical examples of early race integration in the genre, and include historically significant performances with rare appearances from influential African American figures. University of Toronto Scarborough— Toronto, Ontario Awarded: $20,000 Support from the GRAMMY Museum will enable the preservation of the largest known cache of field recordings of traditional French-Canadian instrumental music from Quebec. From 1965 to 1975, folklorist Jean Trudel recorded musicians at festivals, concerts, dances, and in their own homes. The grantee will digitize 107 audio and 103 video recordings made by Trudel and designated for inclusion in the National Collection of the Canadian Museum of History.

Ben Böhmer, Yves Tumor, Artbat among biggest ‘winners’ on Spotify since start of pandemic – 909originals;"909originals
 THE STORIES BEHIND THE MUSIC 
909originals
 Music research and analytics platform Viberate has undertaken a study to determine which artists were the biggest winners on Spotify since the start of the pandemic, across the six most listened-to genres. The artists were selected according to their follower growth over the 12 month period between April 2020 and April 2021, a solid listener-to-follower ratio, and over 100.000 monthly listeners. In the ‘Electronic’ category, the most successful artist on Spotify was German house producer Ben Böhmer, who achieved a 143% increase in followers during the period, boosted by his releases Cappadocia and Moments, which gained more than 18 million streams. In September, the Göttingen native played a special livestream set for Cercle, from a hot air balloon above Turkey. Also scoring highly, according to the report, were US-based artists Yves Tumor (who released album Heaven to a Tortured Mind last Spring) and INZO, along with Ukraine’s Artbat and Unknown Brain, from the UK. Viberate’s report also determined that Spotify playlists and TikTok were hugely influential during the lockdown period, with each top-performing artist’s tracks either going viral on TikTok at some point or being included in an influential playlist. The report also showed that Pop was the most popular genre on Spotify during lockdown, followed by Hip Hop, Latin, Rock, R&B, and Electronic.

Music Research Group - UCLan;"The Music Research Group brings together theoreticians, historians and practice-based researchers engaged in exploring music from multiple perspectives from across the University: composition, performance, ethnomusicology, history, economy, law and cultural studies.  It includes practitioners composing popular and experimental music; historians, researching popular music in the UK, Europe and across the globe; archivists, collecting rare musical instruments and music samples. Our aims are to bring together theory, history and practice in all aspects of music research. The Music Research Group connects with the music industry, through conferences, guest speaker programme, music festivals and active involvement with the Leaders in Residence programme. Since its inception, the group has organised several international conferences on topics such as the future of popular music, musical improvisation and live music. The work of this group is reflected in several volumes, published by Routledge, Bloomsbury, Palgrave and Equinox. Key projects have included Popular Music in the Post-Digital Age and the series of events devoted to improvisation. Practice-based research in composition, performance and recording has led to a number of record releases, concerts and workshops. Interdisciplinary research includes collaborations with groupings as diverse as Dance and Somatic Practice and the Law School Here is a small selection of our many projects: Global Sound Movement Global Sound Movement (GSM) was founded in 2014 by Phil Holmes and Paresh Parmar as an initiative committed to the preservation and re-use of unique sounds of the world. GSM source rare, hand-built musical instruments of cultural significance and travel to record them in their natural environment in collaboration with the instrument builders and performers. Once the initial recordings have been made, months of post-production create sample libraries enabling the global musical community to include them in new compositions. Along with the musical elements, natural recording sessions take place to archive the rich sonic tapestry that surrounds the villages and cities that GSM visit. All location recordings are available for sound designers and music producers to compose with, adding authenticity to creative projects based in these specific regions. Music producers can purchase these unique sounds and instruments along with royalty-free loops to use as they wish in modern compositions. All funds generated are sent to the original communities and instrument builders. This has a lasting impact as monies are being used to educate children in Africa, build community dwellings in Indonesia and support agricultural workforces in China. In 2016 Global Sound Movement won the Times Higher Education Award for ‘Excellence and Innovation in the Arts'. The Future of Popular Music This project was the brainchild of Ewa Mazierska, Les Gillon and Tony Rigg and was realised through a series of conferences and publications. The four conferences were titled The ‘Future of Music’ conferences included academic papers and panels with representatives from the music industry. These were attended by international speakers from France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria. There were presentations by music professionals from Hungary and Austria, along with many from the UK, allowing for the exchange of ideas. They were open to the general public and were well attended, with the audience reaching over 300 participants. The tangible results of these conferences were academic publications. In 2019, Mazierska, Gillon, and Rigg published an edited collection Popular Music in the Post-Digital Age: Politics, Economy, Culture and Technology. They also published a second collection, based on the conference ‘The Future of Live Music’, published in 2020 under the title The Future of Live Music (Bloomsbury). This was edited by the same team of researchers. The third collection, The Evolution of Electronic Dance Music expected in 2021. In addition, along with leading UK music lawyer Ann Harrison Tony Rigg published The Present and Future of Music Law in summer 2021 Adam de Paor-Evans: Rhythm Obscura Rhythm Obscura was initiated in 2017 by partners from other international academic institutions, Justin Williams (University of Bristol) and David Kerr (University of Johannesburg). The project’s core agenda is revealing the hidden histories of music cultures and exploring their significance for individuals, families, and communities. Rooted in ethnographic research and cultural theory, Rhythm Obscura has produced two monographs, a range of open access journal articles, three international symposia, and numerous public panel discussions, and workshops, comprising artists, practitioners, and academics UCLan Recordings UCLan Recordings supports music production by students, staff, and local musicians, augmenting research practice outputs of staff, supporting the development of entrepreneurial and managerial skills, and releasing music and media across all major digital platforms globally. UCLan Recordings has also supported Cold Bath Street, a band led by Simon Partridge and comprising UCLan music staff, current undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as alumni. UCLan Recordings has released several albums by the band and in May 2019 staged a concert where the band performed with one of the world’s leading drummers, Carl Palmer (Atomic Rooster; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; and Asia). Future plans for UCLan Recordings include releases by electronic music pioneer Graham Massey (808 state, Bjork) and acclaimed guitarist Aziz Ibrahim (Stone Roses, Ian Brown, Simply Red) who is working with producer Johnny Jay on EDI projects focussing on the South Asian community in Lancashire. UCLan Recordings is also due to publish an album of music resulting from Jon Aveyard and Dan Wilkinson’s practice-based ‘Third City’ via the editorial board-controlled imprint ‘X-Periments in Sound’.

The six articles published here cover a wide geographical range from the African nations of Nigeria, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and South Africa to Australia. Several topical issues are addressed in relation to politics and society, the Covid-19 pandemic, and issues of sex and gender. The objectification of women is of immediate concern to contemporary global debates on the sexual abuse and harassment of women in society, including the #MeToo movement. Adeola Ojoawo and Akinmade Akande take this up in an article about sexual metaphors in hip-hop music, focusing on the ways in which Nigerian hip-hop musicians and dancers use sexual imagery and metaphor to encode cultural meanings. Through close analysis of lyrics, and discussion of music videos, they show how sex is equated with dance, food, and games. The use of sexual metaphors breaks social convention and taboo, suggesting that hip-hop is a space in which these mores are both contested and instrumentalised to appeal to a youthful audience. Colin Chasi and Cuthbeth Tagwirei write about “Death and Ubuntu in Oliver Mtukudzi's Music.” “Tuku” Mtukudzi was an icon of world music. His frequent reflections on death are unusual. Chasi and Tagwirei select songs from Tuku's huge corpus to focus on the spiritual dimensions of death using the concept of ubuntu. “Tuku's music affords us an opportunity to reflect on the mutuality of ubuntu and death in the way dying, bereavement, loss, grief and mortality are communicated.” The authors describe ubuntu as “cultural equity,” reflecting on its importance to the mutual good of society. The discussion of Tuku's lyrics on death considers how these fit certain aspects of his biography, but also turn to broader questions of identity, masculinity, and HIV/AIDS. Thematic to this article are remarks on the passage from life to death, and the ways in which persons come to terms with this through musical experience. Chasi and Tagwirei argue that Tuku engages in a kind of Socratic dialogue that insists on exploring and questioning, and show how he models ubuntu through respect. James Isabirye's important article on “Namadu Drum Music and Dance as Mediation of Healing Rituals among the Bagwere People of Uganda” is an important contribution to Africanist ethnomusicology, offering the first ethnographic study of this indigenous practice. Spirits play a crucial role in the healing process associated with namadu and

"A-level music education in schools could ""disappear"" in just over a decade";"It's feared the subject could have zero entries by 2033 A-level music education in schools could completely disappear in just over a decade, new research has claimed. Falling access to the music qualifications has been accelerated by cuts to local and central government funding, according to researchers at Birmingham City University. They now warn that the qualifications could disappear entirely by 2033, cutting off an entire pipeline of future talent from the UK. Lead researchers Dr Adam Whittaker and Professor Martin Fautley’s findings have now led music academics and music industry professionals to call for an urgent intervention and package of policy and funding measures to support the UK’s state music education system. Dr Whittaker said: “We know from trends in A-level uptake over the last few years that the number of pupils taking A-level music has fallen to a very concerning level. “We are now in a position where there are parts of the country with very limited access to A-level music or, in some cases, no access at all. “Children can’t choose a qualification that isn’t offered to them. What is the child who wants to take A-level music to do if the nearest school offering it is 30 miles away? We need A-level music, and other specialist subjects, to be offered in a range of schools right across a local authority area. “This is important as A-level music can support young musicians to pursue music in higher education and their future careers, including as the next generation of music educators.” In their research, which is available here, Dr Whittaker and Professor Fautley claim that “Those who lack the means to support private instrumental study are unlikely to have sufficient income to pay for independent school fees, even if a bursary supports them to a greater or lesser extent…the current rates of decline in entries in recent years shows A-level music is likely to have zero entries by 2033 if the current rate of decline continues in a linear manner.” Our Chief Executive @jnjokugoodwin has been appointed to a panel involved in the ""vitally important"" work of helping shape the future of music education. You can read more about their work here: https://t.co/TzAXE5Bhiy — UK Music (@UK_Music) August 8, 2021  In the report, it was also revealed that independent schools account for a disproportionately high number of A-level music entries when compared to national entry statistics – potentially causing a gulf in talent. Their research also confirmed that the proportion of students taking music education in the Midlands has dropped to just 1% following a fall in the number of schools and colleges offering the course as an option – in line with national uptake. Calling on the government for change, UK Music Chief Executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin said: “There has been a worrying decline in the number of young people studying music at A-level in recent years. “Unless action is taken to reverse that trend, there is a real risk of serious damage to the talent pipeline on which the music industry relies. “Music education enriches the lives of countless children and young people, but it also brings huge cultural, economic and social benefits to the UK. “At UK Music, we are continuing to talk to the Government and education leaders about how we can ensure that children from every background get the best possible chance to study music which is one of our great national assets.” Professor Martin Fautley added: “We have been concerned about the falling numbers taking A-level music for some time. Music is an important part of the lives of many of our young people, yet fewer and fewer of them are choosing advanced studies in it whilst at school. “With the increasing fragmentation of the education system that this government has overseen, there exists the very real possibility than many of our youngsters will simply not have the opportunity for this study, even if they should want to do so.” The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.

I’m a musician and this will unfairly affect thousands of people’s livelihoods. We have been left behind during Covid-19 and now maybe left behind because of Brexit. Live music is important to me and any EU fees and barriers will be disastrous for it and the performers’ livelihoods. My band and I would love to tour in Europe in the future, and this will be much harder to achieve without this musicians passport I still want to be able to see all those great musicians from UK here in Germany. And I want to support them because it's the only way to make a living from music It can be useful to have examples of musicians and their experiences to share. Here are a few case studies from musicians – and where to find more. I’d probably lose half of my income as a direct result of the loss of freedom of movement due to Brexit. I am established and successful. I shudder to think how anyone is going to be able to earn a decent income who is just starting out. – Catherine As a 21 year-old cellist, I have been lucky enough to be able to perform around Europe for the last few years participating in festivals and solo recitals. These concerts are vital for creating contacts but due to being at the start of my career, are often not huge pay checks. I have been invited to Spain and Germany for two festivals this summer, this now means two sets of flights, different work permit/visa requirements and an ATA Carnet. I am still trying to work out if I can afford to go. – Maxim Because of Covid travel restrictions I have given only two live performances within the EU since March 2020. I am extremely concerned that when these restrictions are eventually lifted the practical difficulties (red tape and associated costs) of touring post-Brexit will mean the permanent loss of two-thirds of my income. This would render a formerly viable career unsustainable, even more so when you consider that work at home has been so limited for the past year with no prospect of a return to anything like normal service in the foreseeable future and also that streaming which the public has relied upon to ease them through successive lockdowns is not adequately remunerated. – Sophia Whatever the case for Brexit, there should be no unintended consequences damaging the cultural and artistic community of the UK, and with hope for recovery for that massively damaged sector, everything must be done to support it as touring abroad thankfully becomes possible again. – Jeremy Read more stories from musicians and fans on the Musicians’ Passport petition, and in the latest Musicians’ Union-ISM report.   Film projector Many musicians & performers in Glasgow North already excluded from UK gov support now left reeling from the Tories' disgraceful refusal to negotiate visa-free EU touring.

Don Marquis loves his cigars. So long, be well. Sandra Dartus, left, Don Marquis, center, and Greg Lambousy during a fundraiser for the New Orleans Jazz Museum at the Old U.S. Mint on December 7, 2019. Don Marquis, a prolific writer, researcher and French Quarter fixture who dedicated his life to documenting New Orleans jazz, died July 29 in his hometown of Goshen, Indiana. He was 88. For six decades, Marquis was the bard of Big Easy jazz. He wrote countless articles, penned a classic book about early jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden and established the New Orleans Jazz Museum at the Old U.S. Mint. Growing up in Goshen in the 1940s, a young Donald Marquis first heard 78 rpm recordings of Louis Armstrong at a neighbor’s house. He was enthralled. His senior year in high school, he talked his way into tagging along with older acquaintances to an Armstrong show at the Blue Note in Chicago. During a break, Marquis wandered down the hallway leading to the dressing rooms. Someone asked if he wanted to meet Armstrong. The star and the high school senior hit it off. Armstrong quipped to his wife, Lucille, that Marquis was “one of the cats.” Seventy years later, Marquis was still proud that Satchmo referred to him as a “cat.” An 18-year-old Don Marquis, right, with Louis Armstrong at the Blue Note in Chicago circa 1951. He served four years in the Navy, then earned an English degree from Goshen College, graduating in 1959. He went to work in Cleveland writing humorous text for American Greeting Cards. Whenever a New Orleans jazz band passed through town, he’d bring his record player to the show, so he could hang out with the musicians afterward and listen to more music with them. One of those visiting musicians said, “What are you doing in Cleveland? You belong in New Orleans.” As it happened, JoAnne Yoder, a woman Marquis dated at Goshen College, was working on a master’s degree in social work at Tulane University. “I moved to New Orleans for two reasons: a girl and jazz,” Marquis recalled in 2020. “The jazz lasted.” He arrived in March 1962, just in time for Mardi Gras. He set out to write a book about the history of jazz while supporting himself as a freelance greeting card writer and a proofreader at The Times-Picayune. He fully immersed himself in the local jazz community, which was still subject to segregation laws. While walking with several Black musicians from Preservation Hall to the red beans emporium/late-night hangout Buster Holmes’ restaurant, the police stopped him. He didn’t have any identification, so he spent the night in jail. A job at the public library gave him access to a vast trove of research material. That material informed the book that cemented Marquis’ status in the canon of jazz literature: “In Search of Buddy Bolden: First Man of Jazz.” For six decades, Don Marquis, a son of small-town Indiana, has been the bard of Big Easy jazz.  Originally published in 1978 and revised in 2005, Marquis’ meticulously researched biography of Bolden is considered the definitive work on the New Orleans cornetist. Marquis illuminated Bolden’s little-known life and career, which were cut short by alcoholism and mental illness. For years, Marquis edited the New Orleans Jazz Club periodical The Second Line. The Jazz Club opened the original New Orleans Jazz Museum in 1961 on Dumaine Street. The collection, which grew to more than 20,000 items — photographs, sheet music, instruments, architectural fragments from Storyville clubs and musicians’ homes — moved to other locations before being donated to the Louisiana State Museum in the late 1970s. That laid the foundation for the current New Orleans Jazz Museum, a multifaceted facility that occupies much of the Old U.S. Mint at the foot of Esplanade Avenue. “Don pretty much came with the collection,” Greg Lambousy, the museum’s director, said last year. Palm Court Jazz Cafe proprietor Nina Buck, 78, left, dances with her dear friend Don Marquis. As music curator, Marquis oversaw the storage and inventory of the museum’s holdings. In the early 1980s, he built and curated the first Jazz Museum exhibit on the Mint’s second floor, setting the stage for its future growth with his passion, knowledge and connections. “It was a big job, putting it all together,” Marquis said. “What a thrill it was.” After retiring in the late 1990s, Marquis assumed the title of jazz curator emeritus. He stayed involved in research and fundraising projects. He donated enough material from his voluminous archives to fill an entire section of the museum’s storage facilities. He continued to write on his trusty electric typewriter, making do without a computer or email. He was interviewed for Ken Burns’ acclaimed series “Jazz.” Marquis was a consultant on director Dan Pritzker’s 2019 film “Bolden,” a dramatization of Buddy Bolden’s life. The previous year, the Chicago-based Jay Pritzker Foundation — named for Dan Pritzker’s entrepreneurial father, the billionaire co-founder of the Hyatt hotel chain — donated $200,000 to the Jazz Museum. One stipulation of the donation was that the museum’s reading room be named the Donald M. Marquis Reading Room, a permanent tribute to the man who meant so much to the museum specifically and jazz scholarship in general. Marquis never got married or had children. For more than 40 years, he lived at 1312 Royal St. in a one-bedroom, ground-floor apartment. The adjacent courtyard hosted many good times, as did the nearby Golden Lantern. Several years ago, he traveled to Indiana for cancer treatment. He returned to a different French Quarter apartment, but never quite regained his footing. Coronavirus isolation was also hard on him. His diet, heavily dependent on Verti Marte, suffered. In August 2020, he moved to an assisted living facility in Goshen, so his nieces and other relatives could help care for him. His departure was delayed by a day so he could attend the New Orleans Jazz Museum’s weekly balcony concert on Aug. 4, Louis Armstrong’s birthday. Japanese trumpeter Yoshio Toyama, who performs in the style of Louis Armstrong, speaks with Don Marquis during a reception at the Old U.S. Mint in New Orleans on Friday, August 1, 2014. Toyama, his wife Keiko, and their entourage from Japan presented $10,000 to the Louisiana Museum Foundation from jazz lovers in Japan. The money would go toward reopening the New Orleans Jazz Museum, which was damaged during Hurricane Katrina.  As the Treme-Lafitte Brass Band played, Marquis tapped a beat with his feet, puffed a cigar, sipped chardonnay and greeted a steady stream of well-wishers. That evening, he said he wanted his tomb in Goshen to be inscribed with the title of the song that often opened Armstrong's concerts: “Back Home Again in Indiana.” Don Marquis was still one of the cats, till the very end. Visitation will be Tuesday, Aug. 3 from 6 to 8 p.m. with a Rosary at 7:30 p.m. at Yoder-Culp Funeral Home in Goshen, Indiana. A funeral Mass will be held Wednesday, Aug. 4, at 11 a.m. at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in Goshen. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the New Orleans Jazz Museum.

The Ofsted Music Research Review - Kapow Primary;"Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons Stage Units Year 1 Year 2 Lessons This is written by music specialist, Dr Liz Stafford. In a new departure for the inspectorate, Ofsted began publishing a series of research reviews in April 2021, with the aim of collating current subject-specific research evidence that might help subject leaders with their curriculum planning. The Music research review was published on 12th July 2021, and in this blog, we summarise the key takeaways from this document that are relevant to primary music subject leaders. Ofsted states that: ‘this review starts from the assumption that a central purpose of good music education is for pupils to make more music, think more musically and consequently become more musical.’ This is great news for primary music as it reiterates that it is a practical, skills-based subject and provides an alternative approach to the messaging coming from ministers and the DfE of late (particularly with the publication of the Model Music Curriculum), which places emphasis on listening to, learning facts about, and reading and writing music. The review begins with an interesting point that music is often appreciated for its wider benefits, but that this is not always helpful ‘if it encourages a view of music as existing in the service of other subjects and competencies.’ The review also casts doubt on whether some of the common claims made about the benefits of music are actually valid. This is interesting given that one of the things Ofsted look for in a curriculum is how it promotes transferable skills. Ofsted’s view is that ‘what can be said with a degree of certainty is that learning music is good for becoming more musical. Playing the piano is helpful for improving piano performance, singing in a choir supports becoming a good choral singer and writing lots of songs is a foundation for expertise in songwriting. These are wonderful things in and of themselves and need no further justification.’ The review goes on to identify ‘three interrelated pillars that provide the foundation of a musical education’ and states that progress in music requires pupils to develop musically across each of these through the activities of performing, composing and listening. Each of these pillars is dealt with at length within the review, exploring a range of research materials to establish how they can deliver progressive musical development over time. Published at a time when there is a focus on ‘knowledge rich’ curricula, this Ofsted research review looks at how tacit (experiential), procedural (skills) and declarative (facts) knowledge can help pupils ‘become more musical’. It is really helpful to see types of knowledge broken down in this way, as the ‘knowledge rich’ approach can often result in reducing the curriculum down to the gathering of facts for regurgitation. This also reflects existing theories of musical knowledge (Swanwick et al), which acknowledge that in music there is: The Kapow Primary Music scheme of work is based on these three types of musical knowledge, and therefore also covers the types of knowledge listed in this Ofsted research review. While we do offer supporting documentation for a declarative (facts-based) approach, such as knowledge organisers, catchers, and quizzes, our curriculum embraces the broader definition of knowledge as outlined in this research review, and is predominantly procedural (skills-based), delivered through tacit (experiential) and instructional learning. It is great to see Ofsted reinforcing this type of approach in their research review! Another useful aspect of this review is that it acknowledges that the amount of time available for the music curriculum is already scant, with most primary pupils receiving just 15-20 hours a year of music teaching. The review reiterates throughout that schools should not try to do too much in the little time that they have available but should instead adopt a ‘less is more’ approach, focusing on repetition and consolidation in order to develop schemas and reduce cognitive load. Whether or not you buy into the cognitive science trend that is sweeping education at the moment, there is a long tradition of research supporting the adoption of a ‘spiral curriculum’ in music, where concepts and topics are returned to regularly at gradually deeper levels of understanding each time. The Kapow Primary music materials are based on a spiral curriculum delivered through a range of musical traditions, styles and genres, meaning that schools can use the little time they have available for music to provide both depth and breadth of learning. The Ofsted research review certainly contains a mine of information about music curriculum planning, teaching, and assessment strategies, and music subject leaders are likely to want to read the whole document. After a brief spell as an opera singer, Liz embarked on a 20-year career in music education, teaching at early years, primary and secondary. After Liz had her daughter, she started her own business Music Education Solutions® Limited, helping teachers across the UK deliver music with confidence.

Recognition of emotions in music through the Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy (ANFIS): Journal of New Music Research: Vol 50, No 4;"We're pleased that you plan to submit your article! Before starting your submission, please check that this journal's publishing policy is compatible with your and your co-authors' funding agreements. Taylor & Francis requires you to delay making an Accepted Manuscript version of your article available if you are not publishing Open Access. This study aims to recognise emotions in music through the Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy (ANFIS). For this, we applied such structure in 877 MP3 files with thirty seconds duration each, collected directly on the YouTube platform, which represent the emotions anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. We developed four classification strategies, consisting of sets of five, four, three, and two emotions. The results were considered promising, especially for three and two emotions, whose highest hit rates were 65.83% for anger, happiness and sadness, and 88.75% for anger and sadness. A reduction in the hit rate was observed when the emotions fear and happiness were in the same set, raising the hypothesis that only the audio content is not enough to distinguish between these emotions. Based on the results, we identified potential in the application of the ANFIS framework for problems with uncertainty and subjectivity.

harbanger, September 28, 2021 at 12:00 PM (ET) (Homegrown Concerts from the Library of Congress);"You can interact with the artist via  text chat exclusively on Facebook during and immediately after the premiere: harbanger (pronounced “harbinger”) is a turntable  septet—an experimental hip-hop music research project exploring turntable  polyphony and polyrhythm. The ensemble emerged through the creative  collaboration of hip-hop activist Harry Allen and DJ Rob Swift during a 2020  Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST) Visiting Artist residency at  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debuting in a performance titled the  wave function collapses. Comprising DJs Axis Pro, Bobby Bangers, The Don  Santos, Emoh Betta, Pryvet Peepsho, Spictakular, and Treeman, harbanger will  present new music composed by The Don Santos (""Where The Movement  Is"") and Pryvet Peepsho (""Pavor Nocturnus"") in their September  28 video premiere. The most exciting aspect of this event may be this: The  original compositions performed by the seven turntablists will draw exclusively  from the Library of Congress’s Citizen DJ platform. Developed by Brian Foo,  2020 Innovator-in-Residence at the Library, the platform is simultaneously a  beat-making tool and a sound-discovery interface; one which encompasses rich  audio collections held at the Library. One of the core challenges in developing  a DJ septet is acquiring suitable music to deconstruct. Without extant 7-part  turntable repertoire—no charts, scores, fake books, or tabs—everything  harbanger plays must be built from scratch. Citizen DJ offers the ensemble a  fascinating new opportunity to do precisely that. All ways to connect

Full article: Performing music research: methods in music education, psychology, and performance science;"We're pleased that you plan to submit your article! Before starting your submission, please check that this journal's publishing policy is compatible with your and your co-authors' funding agreements. Taylor & Francis requires you to delay making an Accepted Manuscript version of your article available if you are not publishing Open Access.   Performing Music Research: Methods in Music Education, Psychology, and Performance Science is a comprehensive manual on research methods and methodologies for researchers, educators and practitioners working in music and other performing or creative arts domains. The book provides step-by-step guidance on how to plan (Part 1), conduct (Part 2), analyse (Part 3) and communicate (Part 4) research endeavours. The organisation of the book, which is highly systematic, mirrors the typical sequence for designing and carrying out empirical projects. The book is particularly interesting from an educational perspective because of its applied focus and its structural features. “Research spotlights” give an applied focus because they outline previously-published studies and illustrate why specific methods are appropriate for addressing particular research questions. Through these spotlights, current trends in music education are revealed, including musicians’ “learning cultures” (p. 87), singers’ uses of resources in the learning process (p. 244) and learner wellbeing (p. 132, 346). There is potential to explore overlaps between these lines of research, such as to examine how learning cultures are created in different artistic domains, and how they might impact upon the wellbeing of individuals during the process of learning. In addition to the main explanatory text, each chapter contains “feature” boxes (“research spotlights”, “closer-look” and “controversial-topic” boxes) and study guides (summaries, keywords and discussion points), and the entire volume has a companion website to facilitate learning (www.performingmusicresearch.com) with quizzes, file templates, practice datasets as well as other relevant links. The book’s structural features help to provide clarity of information and encourage independent learning, reflecting a model for good textbook writing practice (Liu, 2020). Indeed, the combination of dedicated instructional sections and interactive activities encouraged me to consider the importance of key structural features when communicating my research as well as the need to explore hybrid formats of dissemination.

Bach and Beethoven give listeners a taste for sweet things | News | The Times;Listening to Bach or Beethoven could leave you reaching for the biscuit tin but turning down the burgers, a study suggests. People preferred sweet foods when they listened to classical music compared with jazz, hip-hop or rock and heavy metal, researchers found. They were more likely to opt for both unhealthy sweet foods such as chocolate as well as healthier sweet items such as low-fat milk, the scientists discovered. And eating with the likes of Elgar on the radio appeared to turn people off savoury junk foods such as burgers and chips. “Indulgent savoury foods were least preferred when listening to classical music, compared to the other genres,” the researchers, led by Miyagi University in Japan, said.

Classical music and Alzheimer's - could it improve memory? - NR Times;"Published on By Could classical music improve memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive impairment? A three-year study – The Mozart Effect and Memory in patients with cognitive impairment – will assess that exact topic, with music anecdotally being said to have benefit on those living with such conditions.  The project, from the Cognitive Neurolab at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), will investigate whether music can be used to facilitate or enhance learning in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It will also look at which aspects of music are key in establishing a cognitive benefit, so which kinds of music – relaxing or vitalising – and what times are most useful; for example, in the phase in which we learn new information or in that in which we retrieve information we have previously learned. Previous studies have indicated that exposure to music can increase performance in learning and attention-related tasks, but this will look at the most effective kind for memory. “The majority of these studies were on healthy people and we don’t know if music could be a complementary tool for cognitively stimulating those with memory deficits,” says Dr Marco Calabria, leading the project.  “These neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by difficulties in forming new memories, and music could be one way of helping to consolidate new learning.” The study will involve patients from both Barcelona’s Hospital de Sant Pau and from SINGULAR Musica & Alzheimer, a centre in Barcelona specialising in the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of people with Alzheimer’s through music.  In the study’s first phase, participants will carry out memory-related tasks with classical music in the background. They will have to memorise unknown faces and remember them afterwards.  Dr Calabria explains that classical music is being used because “it’s a kind of music that is characterised by being both relaxing and vitalizing, and has proven to be the most effective in giving memory a boost.  “What’s more, the fact that it has no lyrics means there is less of the interference that verbal information can cause with regard to the content that participants will have to learn in the memory tasks.”  In phase two, researchers will use music familiar to participants to see whether the fact they like it could deliver emotional, and therefore memory-related, benefits.   PFA leaders pledge to donate brain to Concussion Legacy Project ‘We want to be part of the solution – for Bill and future generations’ New imaging technique gives better SCI understanding How restoring brain plasticity is the key to reversing brain damage Using music to support dementia patients and carers Men and women ‘process pain signals differently’ Rob Burrow receives MBE 42 new Alzheimer’s risk genes identified Your email address will not be published.

 Dementia Carers Count assess the positive impact music can have on wellbeing Published on By The idea of music being a healing influence goes back centuries. In history, we know that its use has been well-documented.  For example, during the world wars, musicians were invited to play for injured soldiers going through trauma. Music can help to maintain a person’s quality of life or even improve it. For carers, music can be beneficial by helping to lighten mood, helping create connections, reduce stress and bring back memories   Reducing loneliness, improving wellbeing – For someone spending long periods alone, using music for company and comfort. The joy that music can bring to people individually and collectively. Music can maintain or increase levels of physical, mental, social, and emotional functioning (Cochrane Review, 2013) Stimulation – Stimulating music can help with daily activity such as personal care where it can help with movement. Examples could be music with percussion, beats such as swing or band music, music that makes people want to tap or clap. This could help in helping someone to dress or bathe.  Sensory – For people with hearing loss, there may be other ways of music helping create connection such as using instruments to help them feel rhythm, or being part of a group activity, photos being used for reminiscence of certain era’s that they may be part of. Soothing – Music can be used in many ways to diffuse distress when it may be too late to use other activities. Singing or putting on a favourite piece of music can help to reduce the distress or anxiety that the person with dementia may be feeling as well as helping the carer. This may be helpful if someone is agitated around sundowning hours. It can help when preparing for bed by putting on soothing music and setting the scene to help the person relax (things like classical music or ballads).   Memories – There may be songs that trigger and cause different emotional reactions. There are times when this may not be appropriate for the person, but its also considering that its also ok to be sad. Environment – Music can also be very distracting and at times it may cause additional distress. Volume – Ensuring this is right for the person or group due to heightened senses. Over-stimulation – At times where the person may need to relax.   Playlists – These can be very powerful in using specific songs that are from our musical memories. For example, there are wonderful videos of people with dementia having powerful reactions to music including Marta Gonzalez who was a prima ballerina and hears swan lake and starts to move to the music. An idea is to have a playlist set-up on a tablet so that this could play favourite songs. This can be an activity set-up by a carer or one that can help bring connection. Live music – Research shows the benefits of live singing and often care homes will have live singers because of the reaction that residents have to hearing someone singing live. There are resources online such as Songhaven and the BBC archives which offer concert videos. You Tube is also a good resource to look for specific bands or singers. Singing activities – Singing for the brain, encouraging the connection between people. Using music to prompt memories such as starting a song that’s well-known or musical bingo. It is a good well-being activity for people with dementia, but also for carers. How many of us use music to help us to get through life’s moments? Some music helps us to feel happier, connecting with happy memories, or we can also be reminded of difficult, sad times. Quick ideas for family carers – A quick sing-song, Making music to play along with, listening to favourite songs, live music, church/chapel service, themed quiz, relax and pamper.  The largest study of its kind found a total of 75 genes associated with greater risk of the dementia Published on By A new study has identified 75 genes associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, with 42 of these not previously linked to the condition. The findings of the international research, and largest study of its kind, could now be set to open new avenues for treatment and diagnosis.  Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 26million people worldwide, with no treatment available to improve the course of the disease.  To better understand the origins of the disease, one of the major challenges of research is to better characterise its genetic risk factors by identifying the biochemical and cellular processes affected, and thereby propose novel therapeutic targets. As part of an international collaboration, researchers from Inserm, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille University Hospital and Université de Lille, alongside Bristol Medical School at the University of Bristol, conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the largest Alzheimer’s patient group ever created, under the co-ordination of Inserm Research Director Professor Jean-Charles Lambert. Encouraged by advances in genome analysis, these studies consist of analysing the entire genome of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of individuals, whether healthy or sick, with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors associated with specific aspects of the disease. Using this method, the scientists were able to identify 75 regions of the genome associated with Alzheimer’s, 42 of which had never previously been implicated in the disease.   “Following this major discovery, we characterised these regions in order to give them meaning in relation to our clinical and biological knowledge, and thereby gain a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms and pathological processes at play,” explained Prof Lambert. In Alzheimer’s disease, two damaging processes are already well documented – the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and the modification of the protein Tau, aggregates of which are found in brain cells. Here, the scientists confirmed the importance of these pathological processes. Their analyses of the various genome regions confirm that some are implicated in amyloid peptide production and Tau protein function. Furthermore, these analyses also reveal that a disturbance of innate immunity and of the action of the microglia is at play in Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Previous genetic discoveries underpin much of our current understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and the direction of research into new treatments.  “Creating an extensive list of Alzheimer’s disease risk genes is like having the edge pieces of a puzzle put together, and while this work doesn’t give us the full picture, it provides a valuable framework for future developments. Professor Pat Kehoe, Gestetner Professor of Translational Dementia Research at Bristol Medical School, added: “Despite the knowledge we are amassing as to the biological mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease we are still faced by gaps in our understanding. “This means the devil is still in the detail and where studies like this will help to us to begin to fill those gaps and indeed something that future tissue studies from our own South West Dementia Brain Bank may continue to help in furthering our understanding of the proteins that these genes make in the disease process.” Based on their findings, the researchers also devised a genetic risk score to try to better evaluate which patients with cognitive impairment will, within three years of the initial emergence of memory problems, go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease.  “While this tool is not at all intended for use in clinical practice at present, it could be very useful when setting up therapeutic trials in order to categorise participants according to their risk and improve the evaluation of the medications being tested,” added Prof Lambert.  Over half would also go on to develop dementia within three years, the research reveals Published on By Cases of cognitive decline in older people have more than doubled in ten years, new research has shown.  The study looked at data from more than 1.3million adults aged between 65 and 99 years old, taken between 2009 and the end of 2018.  The researchers identified 55,941 adults who had spoken to their GP about memory concerns and 14,869 people who had a record of cognitive decline. For every 1,000 people that were observed for one year in 2009, there was one new case of cognitive decline being recorded.  By 2018, for every 1,000 people that were observed for one year, there were three new cases of cognitive decline being recorded. The UCL study also showed that within three years of following up a person from the date when the doctor reported a memory concern, 46 per cent of people would go on to develop dementia.  For people with cognitive decline, 52 per cent would go on to develop dementia. Lead author and PhD candidate Brendan Hallam, of UCL Epidemiology & Health Care, said: “This is an important study which sheds new light on how prevalent memory concerns and cognitive decline are among the older generation in the UK and how likely these symptoms might progress to a dementia diagnosis.  “The study showed that while memory concern rates had remained stable, incidences of cognitive decline, a step beyond memory concern, had more than doubled between 2009 and 2018. “There has been a drive in the past decade to encourage people to seek help earlier from their doctors if they are worried about their memory and we found that among those over 80, women and people living in more deprived areas were more likely to have a record of memory concern or cognitive decline, and their symptoms were more likely to progress to dementia diagnosis.” Co-author, Professor Kate Walters, explained: “People who have been noted in their health records as having concerns about their memory are at just under 50 per cent chance of developing dementia within the next three years.” Brendan continued: “Memory concerns and cognitive decline are not only hallmark symptoms of dementia, but they also predict a high risk of developing dementia.  “It is important for GPs to identify people with memory concerns as soon as possible to deliver recommendations to improve memory and allow timely diagnosis of dementia.” The authors note one potential limitation of the present study is the potential variations in which GPs record memory concerns and memory decline.

Video game giant supports PhD student’s non-linear time in music research - University of Gloucestershire Video game giant supports PhD student’s non-linear time in music research;Matt Deegan, a Music and Sound PhD student at the University of Gloucestershire, has been awarded $10,000 by US video game giant Epic Games, to support his innovative research on non-linear time in music composition using computer game software. Unlike in films or on TV, where the musical score is written with a specific scene in mind and will be the same each time it is played back, sound for a computer game is dependent on user input and will be different each time. This means that music for the gaming industry, now worth an estimated $300 billion worldwide, needs to be interactive and adaptive – in other words, non-linear – because it is impossible to predict how long a player will spend trying to solve a puzzle or defeat an enemy. Turning the situation on its head, Matt is carrying out research to find out how computer game software can be utilised to write non-linear music as the game is being played, providing the game player with a unique experience every time they play. Matt’s study has received $10,000 in funding from Epic Games’ $100 million MegaGrants scheme that aims to support game developers, enterprise professionals and media and entertainment creators. Matt said: “To say I was thrilled that my application for funding was successful would be an understatement. The grant from Epic Games will help fund my PhD studies and purchase key equipment to use in my research. “Computer games are big business and have grown inexorably since the 1970s. They are prevalent in our daily lives and exist on computers, tablets and mobile phones and follow different formats such as 2D, 3D, virtual and augmented reality. “Sound design and music are an integral part of these formats and are created to enhance each game. There is a wide variety of sound, from explosion sound effects to full orchestral music scores, aimed at enhancing the player’s journey through the game. “The idea of my research is to explore the possibilities surrounding music and sound creation using Epic Games’ Unreal Engine game development software. “This software provides sophisticated tools for a range of elements including game development, virtual, augmented and mixed realities, film, video and live events, architecture, engineering and construction, and product design. “No one can predict where technology will take us and how it will be consumed, and investigating audio creation and manipulation using this technology is not only exciting, but integral to future development.” The post Video game giant supports PhD student’s non-linear time in music research appeared first on University of Gloucestershire.;https://ift.tt/3ucKcxB;

Conference Report: KVNM-RMA International Postgraduate Symposium – Royal Musical Association;"Held over July 3 and 4, the Online KVNM-RMA International Postgraduate Symposium in Music Research 2021 was a collaborative effort between the Royal Society for Music History of the Netherlands (KVNM) and the UK Royal Musical Association (RMA). While COVID-19 regulations had led to modified output in 2020, this online gathering allowed the organizers in 2021 to present this, the third conference, as the first fully digital iteration of the conference. There was no cost for registration for presenters, a measure which was seen as being of particular benefit to students. Sessions were made open to the public also free of charge. Single sessions presented by twenty speakers were run over the course of both days. Session chairs were on hand to assist, as presenters shared their research through screen share using video conferencing platforms. While there were some technical issues with audio or visual content, these were swiftly addressed by organizers. There were short breaks held between sessions, but no online social events took place. The conference brought together Master’s students and doctoral researchers from institutions based in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The breadth of study between these two countries at the postgraduate level was evident. A variety of approaches to music research were shared throughout the conference including, but not limited to, fieldwork, composition, historical, and empirical research. Given the juxtaposition of the two locales, research similarities were well grouped, both within subcategories and in allowing similarities of broader scope to be made clear overall through the presentations. Presenters shared their research on topics such as music and politics – particularly World War II research with multiple papers addressing elements of the era. Further, from the first session of July 3, various compositional perspectives were offered over both days. During the conference, performance practices and pedagogy, and the physicality of music and music creators/performers also emerged as a theme. Opera featured prominently over both days, with various topics such as Parody under Fascism: The Case of Ghedini’s La pulce d’oro (1940) by Maria Grazia Aurora Campisi from the University of Birmingham which examined the decline of Italian opera staged through Ghedini and the role of parody in crisis. Hindemith’s Operatic Triptych and Discourses of Expressionism in Weimar Culture by Daniel Boucher also from the University of Birmingham, questioned perceptions of cultural politics from 1920s arts and culture. Split Characters in Twentieth-Century Opera by Eva van Daele from the University of Ghent demonstrated layers of ‘disturbances’ between the relationship of performer and character. The physicality of music was examined through presentations such as The Potential Effects of Weight Training on Singers: Review and Meta-Analysis by Kari Ding from the University of Edinburgh where the body as an instrument was examined through the lens of weight training as a cross training method opening a conversation for further research, and Optimizing Performance: Pre-Performance Routines in Professional Orchestral Musicians by Berenice Beverley Zammit from the Royal College of Music. In this presentation Zammit introduced the FIT MUSICIAN survey, as she shared findings from the HEartS Professional – a project launched by the RCM to examine the physical activity of musicians during lockdown. Several other presentations examined the challenges and advantages of a year spent largely remotely, using online means, with presentations such as The Future is Now: Virtual Music Performance in the 21st Century by David Cotter from the University of Cambridge which showcased compositional research using distance and ‘lag’ as a compositional element, this research approached the creative partnerships operating remotely and the use of omnidirectional feedback loops in the virtual domain. The Challenges of Online Piano Teaching During Covid-19 by Angela Qiao from the University of Edinburgh examined digital pedagogy as a practical research approach, Qiao acknowledged the difficulties of online instruction but also highlighted positive aspects and shared feedback gathered from a small sample of piano teachers working in the digital space. These presentations undertook the challenge of digital creation, and stood as a testament to the enduring nature of music creation and pedagogy. Throughout the conference presenters demonstrated engagement with contemporary issues and themes, which were expressed in a myriad of ways. The details for the next 2022 KVNM-RMA International Postgraduate Symposium in Music Research will be announced in due course. About the author:  Lark McIvor is a composer and musicologist with a Masters in Music Composition from Trinity College Dublin and a Masters in Musicology from the University of Edinburgh.

Priyadarshini becomes the first playback singer to receive Ph.D - Star of Mysore;"Doctorate degree for her 100 years of film music research with more than 1,000-page thesis Mysore/Mysuru: Playback singer R. Priyadarshini has been awarded Ph.D in Music by the University of Mysore (UoM) for her thesis ‘Music in Kannada and Tamil Cinema – A Study’ submitted under the guidance of Dr. C.A Sreedhara.  She is considered to be the first Indian playback singer to present a longest doctoral thesis of 1,000-plus pages in her research study pertaining to 100 years of Cinema Music. This is also regarded as the sourcebook for the film music study. She received her Ph.D certificate from Governor-Chancellor Thaawarchand Gehlot and Higher Education Minister Dr. C.N. Ashwathnarayan during the 101st convocation of the UoM held in Mysuru recently. Explaining why she chose ‘cinema music’ for her research study, she said: “It was a burning vision for me to create an indigenous resource of 100 years of Cinema music study (1917-2020) which includes the special qualities, musical intricacies, music in different aspects, background scores, few song analysis which works towards preserving, creating awareness of the Tamil and Kannada Film Industry’s cinematic music legacy. I have worked with many legendary Music Directors for more than 110 movies as a singer. I always felt the need for a reference source specifically on cinema music which led to my research. This will certainly be a source of knowledge for future generations, musicians, singers, artistes, technicians and others to understand the significance of film music, its evolution, its multi-dimensional aspects and its development.” Elaborating further about her work, Priyadarshini said,“I carried out my research study under research guide Dr. C.A Sreedhara. I always utilised and converted my break time during recording sessions, music shows into  healthy conversations to gather details and collect information relating to my study with my music directors, co-singers, lyricists, sound engineers and technicians.  Apart from this, I also personally met and interviewed many legends which is a huge list of more than 150 personal interviews. To name a few A.R. Rahman, S. Janaki, Ilaiyaraaja, M. Balamuralikrishna, Vani Jayaram, Ramkumar Ganesan, Dhina, Rajan-Nagendra, P. Susheela, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, K.S. Chitra, R. Rathna, B.K. Sumitra, V. Manohar, Bhara-dwaj who shared their valuable experiences with me.” Stating that she intends to publish her thesis as a book, she said: “I am also trying to translate this from English to other languages. Since it is the longest thesis in film music, I am planning to send it to the Guinness World Records & Limca Book of Records.” Priyadarshini, with BE (EEE), M.

mudcat.org: rebellion and protest in John Henry;"Hi folks,  Some of you may recall a thread I created years ago about my research on racial resistance, protest, and rebellion in the John Henry ballad. I have written an article which draws on that research, plus includes a discussion about the ""Stagolee"" ballad and the connection between the two ballads. For those familiar with Cecil Brown's book Stagolee Shot Billy or who have an interest in the Stagolee ballad, I believe you will find that my article contains much about the ballad that has never been published before.   The article is titled Stagolee and John Henry: Two Black Freedom Songs?  It has been posted to Lamont Pearley's African American Folklorist website.   Below is the address for the article. http://theafricanamericanfolklorist.com/2020/11/29/twoblackfreedomsongs/   Jim Hauser https://sites.google.com/site/johnhenrytherebelversions/home

Ryerson professor to lead music-based development program with psychedelic research - The Eyeopener;"In  Business & TechnologyFebruary 25, 20211 Comment By Nabeeha Baig NeonMind Biosciences Inc., a company specializing in psychedelic mushroom research for therapeutic use, has hired Ryerson psychology professor Frank Russo for a future clinical trial as an advisor.  Russo is an affiliate scientist at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, a core member of the McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind and an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto’s Music and Health Collaboratory.  According to a press release from NeonMind, Russo will assist the company in developing “effective protocols” for psychedelic treatment that include music as part of the therapy. He also plans to build “partnerships in the music industry” and set up projects to support the use of music in improving mental well-being and drug addiction treatment, as stated on the company’s website.  “Music has such a transformative effect on the brain [and] I can foresee its potential to enhance the results that are achievable with psychedelic therapy as well,” said Russo. In the past, Russo’s basic research explored psychology and neuroscience tools that can be used to study music, speech and nonverbal communication, while his applied research focused on music-based interventions to reach “communicative and prosocial gains,” meaning behaviours intending to help other people.  “We’re pursuing clinical research to help us continue down the path of seeking approval for the treatment and [we are] very pleased to be on this journey”  The use of psilocybin for mental health care has gained traction in the last few years. This past summer, Canadian Nurse, an online magazine that shares diverse and innovative ideas in the nursing community, published an article about “psilocybin-based psychotherapy.” Psilocybin is a chemical compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, or “magic mushrooms,” usually from Mexico, South America and the southern United States. The drug has been proven to accelerate the healing process for people experiencing “distressing emotional symptoms such as depression, OCD and anxiety,” according to The Behavioral Wellness Clinic, a mental health and counselling service in the U.S. In the Canadian Nurse article, two trained therapists monitored a patient as they lay on a couch listening to music with eye shades on. The sessions were said to provide an “emotional breakthrough and experience that often leads to mood improvement, antidepressant effects and stress relief—with clinically significant improvements lasting more than six months.” The article states that psilocybin has the ability to “transform the mind and produce a psychologically transformative state.” In doing so, the patient’s self perception changes and any limitations to exploring past traumas are “temporarily lifted.” “For these sessions, the patient’s mindset is essential before, during and after,” said Rob Tessarolo, CEO of NeonMind. “Dr. Russo’s work has shown music can affect a person’s emotional trajectory, so music can potentially be used to set up treatment success.” While psilocybin has been found in natural substances like fungi for thousands of years, Tessarolo said there has been a resurgence of research for the drug and its potential uses. For him, these initiatives are all about following the clinical science and results. “Usually patients try a treatment, it works for a while, and then they crash back and return to the presentations that they had originally.” Tessarolo recently joined the team at the end of January and was particularly intrigued by the company’s work in the area of obesity and weight management.  “We have a belief that music has an impact on the brain, and its effect on the brain will play an important role in the administration of a psychedelic therapeutic treatment,” he said. Coming from a pharmaceutical and psychedelic drug development background, Tessarolo said he tries to find innovation anywhere he can. On average, only 12 per cent of drugs tested in clinical trials gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and the time consuming, expensive process makes the need for innovative ideas quite valuable in this industry.  “These cycles are directly related to treatment failure, either lack of efficacy or lack of a durable effect,” Tessarolo said. “Innovation through drug development could seek to address these shortcomings.” “We think we can break the vicious cycle of these diseases like addiction, depression and obesity,” he said. “Usually patients try a treatment, it works for a while, and then they crash back and return to the presentations that they had originally.” Tessarolo said the current evidence that shows the effects of psychedelic substances is growing, which helps the team understand where these substances have the potential to heal.  “More investment and research is needed to deliver clear and compelling data that support safety and efficacy,” he said. Wanting to ensure that patients will be experiencing the trial in the “best state of mind possible,” Tessarolo was pleased with Russo’s credentials and research.  He added that if the findings from this trial prove to be safe and effective, it would confirm this method to be the only one that’s created any potential change for patients. “These are indeed exciting times in the area of psychedelic drug development,” he said. “We’re pursuing clinical research to help us continue down the path of seeking approval for the treatment and [we are] very pleased to be on this journey.”  Great read! I work for a company researching how psilocybin can be a potential therapeutic option for alcoholism, and I must say the benefits of psychedelics blow my mind away. Glad to see it being recognized all over the world. Comment Name *  Email *  Website

Digital Humanities in Not-So-Early Music Research 2021/3: State-of-the-Art Modern Digital Editions  - Staré mýty, nová fakta;The third session of the 2021 Digital Humanities in Early Music Research workshop series is here, this time organized by the Bohuslav Martinů Institute together with the Old Myths, New Facts project. We would like to wholeheartedly invite you to participate. Given the ongoing pandemic situation, the session will again be held virtually. The workshop will take place via Zoom on September 23rd from 2:15 PM CEST, and September 24th from 10:15 AM CEST. The possibility of digital editions of musical sources has been discussed in musicology for two decades. As the editor of the Martinů Complete Edition, the Martinů Institute has always been extremely interested in the latest developments in this field. That is why we take the opportunity to let two leading experts in this field have their say and discuss the fascinating topic and the future of digital music editions with them. The workshop has the following schedule (all times CEST): September 23rd (Thursday): 2:15 - 3:00 PM: [Introduction part 1] Concepts and Types of Digital Music Editions (Andreas Münzmay, Uni Paderborn)3:15 - 4:00 PM: [Introduction part 2] Music Encoding. Options and Use Cases (Norbert Dubowy, Digital Mozart Edition, Managing Editor, Mozarteum Salzburg)4:00 - 5:00 PM: Break / hands-on work5:00 - 6:00 PM: Discussion -- Perspectives of Digital Music Editions (Andreas Münzmay, Norbert Dubowy) The first part (Thursday, 2:15-3:00 PM) would deal with the overall concept of a digital music edition, from the macro perspective, so to speak, or the surface with which the user first comes into contact. In the second part (3:15-4:00 PM) would then go more into the technical aspects and the various coding options that follow the different objectives and functions of an edition. It will provide some illustrative material and web links with which the participants can then gain their own experience. (This could be done in the one-hour break from 4 to 5 PM.) Afterwards we would meet again for a discussion in which we would again discuss some fundamental questions and in which the participants could put questions to us.  September 24th (Friday): 10:15 AM - 12:00 AM (w/ break): A Closer Look at the Digital Interactive Mozart Edition (Norbert Dubowy) The speaker bios are given below.   Andreas Münzmay is professor for musicology at Paderborn University, Germany, and a researcher in the ZenMEM („Zentrum Musik-Edition-Medien“) research centre for eHumanities and in the long-term project „Beethovens Werkstatt. Genetische Textkritik und Digitale Musikedition“ of the Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz, as well as in the NFDI4Culture – Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage. He holds degrees in musicology, music and French studies. In 2008 he received a PhD from the University of Arts, Berlin, for his thesis on French librettist Eugène Scribe (Musikdramaturgie und Kulturtransfer, publ. Schliengen 2010). He taught musicology in Berlin, Stuttgart, Potsdam, Bayreuth, and Frankfurt and has been working as an editor in the “OPERA – Spektrum des europäischen Musiktheaters” historical-critical hybrid editions series of the Akademie der Wissenschaften Mainz.

Inaugural Conference: September 2021 – IAGMR;"IAGMR Institute of Austrian and German Music Research The Institute of Austrian and German Music Research (IAGMR) in the Department of Music and Media at the University of Surrey is delighted to announce the opening of registration for its inaugural conference: Revisiting Austrian and German Music: from the ‘Spring of Nations’ to the Cold War  September 17–18, 2021 The event is online and free to all.  The conference includes three keynote papers: Mark Berry (Royal Holloway, University of London): ‘Wagner’s Actuality’  Caroline Kita (Washington University in St Louis): ‘Sounding Difference: Revisiting Jewishness and Otherness in Austrian and German Music’ Nick Attfield (University of Birmingham):  ‘Austrofascism, Music, and the Austro-German’  as well as a lecture-recital by Anna Scott (Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, Leiden University): ‘Brahms in a Sharper Key: the Politics of Performance Style’ This conference gives an opportunity to rethink, revise, and renew understanding of Austrian and German music of the 19th and 20th centuries through interrogating historical and scholarly paths towards canonization or obscurity, popularity or neglect, and cultural centres or peripheries. The conference considers music primarily, though not exclusively, from c. 1848 to the 1960s—the ‘Spring of Nations’ to the Cold War—as it emerged during periods of intense cultural and social change in the lives of these nations and neighbouring regions, and in the context of wider European, and indeed global, interconnections which have continued to shape geo-political conditions to this day. The conference aims to render the ‘unmarked’ ‘marked’, the familiar unfamiliar, and, through questioning the very formulation ‘Austro-German’, to explore new methodologies for reconceiving canonic music,, and to open up new avenues of research in neglected areas and overlooked repertoire.

Well, what we know to date is that when it comes to rote tasks, AI has made tremendous progress. As automation has taken on a growing range of routine work, the share of US jobs requiring decision-making rose from 6% in 1960 to 34% in 2018, with nearly half that growth happening after 2007.2 But innovation is a different story. Innovation is about ideating, counter-intuitive approaches, and reading markets in fresh ways to suss out new opportunities. It’s about being creative. And it just so happens that AI is creeping into a new world that many considered immune to AI – creativity. Recently, AI’s been trying to flex its right-brain capabilities. AI is being used to create art, write poems, and even generate music, and is doing so well that it’s often hard to reliably distinguish human from algorithmic creative content.3 That’s why Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum used AI to recreate parts of Rembrandt’s “Night Watch” that were cut off when the artist finished the painting 70 years ago.4 Last year, the first International AI Song Contest was held, encouraging creative teams to experiment with AI and data as part of their songwriting process (check out the winning song here).5 And in March, digital art created by a robot named Sophia sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) for $700,000.6 Now she’s working on “Sophia Pop”, collaborating with musicians to write both music and lyrics.7 Artificial creativity is showing real promise because the technology is now: Generative, not just predictive. In the past seven years, synthetically generated images of human faces have gone from rudimentary to truly life-like.8 And that just scratches the surface of what today’s AI can generate. An AI fed with pictures of more than 1,000 classical sculptures produced its own unique piece, Dio (which was actually made from the shredded remains of the computer that designed it).9 In July 2020, San Francisco–based start-up OpenAI released its new language-processing software, GPT-3, which writes poems, love songs, and even pickup lines on par with many humans.10 The text of a video game was recently generated by GPT-3 as well as a coding autocomplete tool, GitHub Copilot, that provides suggestions as you write code.11 China’s Wu Dao is 10 times bigger than GPT-3, trained using 1.75 trillion parameters compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion, and is multi-modal – it not only generates text but audio and images as well, plus it sings!12 Cheaper and more reusable. Due to the falling cost of cloud computing and progress in algorithm design, AI model training has become cheaper. It cost about $7 to train an image recognition system in 2020, down from about $2,000 three years earlier.13 Transfer – learning the process of creating new AI models by fine-tuning previously trained neural networks – has also made it cheaper and simpler to create AI models. Instead of training a neural network from scratch, developers can download a pretrained, open-source deep learning model and finetune it for their own purpose. The developer Arfa created fake My Little Pony characters by using transfer learning to fine-tune a model that generates fursonas, non-existent furry personas.14 After only 1 hour of training, Arfa’s model was already generating pretty convincing characters.15 Accessible to more than machine learning experts. It’s much easier for creative types to use AI today, even for those with limited coding abilities. Nvidia’s new Canvas tool lets an artist sketch simple shapes and lines with a palette of real-world materials like grass and clouds and then immediately fills the screen with photorealistic content.16 Founded in 2020, Loudly has built music-creation tools, training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) deep learning algorithm on eight million music tracks and 100,000 audio loops. Music like this hip-hop track can be created in seconds. In a rapidly shifting market fueled by new competitors, technologies and consumer demands, companies need to be able to innovate quickly and continuously. Creative AI, AI that can generate content and ideas more easily and cheaply, can help us: Address disruption. In the Disruption Dilemma, Joshua Gans discusses key challenges firms face in addressing disruption, including the ability to see a change coming and identify a response.17 Creative AI could help on both counts. Recently, an AI system trained on almost 40 years of science journals correctly identified 19 out of 20 research papers that have had the greatest scientific impact on biotechnology.18 In 2018, Warner Music Group acquired tech startup Sodatone which uses an algorithm to review social, streaming, and touring data to find promising unsigned talent.19 Similar techniques may help us see and prioritize upcoming disruptors, such as DeFi, quantum, shifting regulations, or even new expectations from Generation Z. AI could also help identify “responses”. As Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling said, “The best way to have a great idea is to have a lot of ideas,” and creative AI is well-suited to generating ideas. VisiBlends, a tool created by researchers at Columbia and Stanford, creates patterns that blend multiple images to guide brainstorming design sessions, producing 10 times as many creative results as unguided brainstorming sessions.20 For example, for the advertising concept “Starbucks is here for summer”, VisiBlends could help find numerous images related to “Starbucks” and “summer” and automatically combine them in a variety of creative ways. Ben Syverson, Design Lead at Ideo, challenged GPT-3 to generate ideas for helping young people save money and got back a bunch of solid ideas, including allowing users to share their saving goals with people who will cheer them on and challenge them, as well as showing users how much they could save if they splurged on new sneakers instead of taking an extra vacation.21 Create better products and experiences. There are many ways that creative AI could enhance products and experiences. Launched in October 2020, Copy.ai uses GPT-3 to generate text for blogs, products, and headlines based on user-provided word inputs.22 Given some impressive advancements in areas like music and art, Creative AI could also jumpstart new personalization initiatives. Founded in 2018, Endel creates personalized sound environments (soundscapes) unique to the user to improve productivity and sleep based on the time of day, weather, as well as a user’s heart rate and motion.23 Launched in July, Artifly (meant to evoke the phrase “Art on the Fly”) creates brand-new personalized art for users in less than a minute after users scroll through a selection of artwork and click the designs they like.24 This same technology that is enabling new individualized art and soundscapes to be created so quickly and effectively could also be used in other industries, really taking personalization to the next level. Enhance innovation in a hybrid work environment. The world of academia offers a useful case study for how creativity can thrive among distributed teams. After rising for decades, by 2018 almost 80% of published US scientific articles were written by teams from multiple institutions.25 The same researchers also found that the unexpected loss of a colleague caused the same reduction to output whether or not coauthors were having regular in-person interactions.26 And this was before AI was heavily in use. To help drive distributed innovations, companies like Donut and Hallway are trying to recreate the workplace “water-cooler” moments virtually by connecting employees to others in the company that they don’t know or haven’t spoken to in a while.27 Similar to recommending a movie to watch or someone to date, AI could make workplace digital introductions pretty sophisticated, taking into account what employees are working on, their emails, and what they’re chatting about on collaboration apps. Add in creative AI – including idea generation and brainstorming with AI – and the physical office could become less essential for innovation. Will artificial creativity lead to security and copyright risks? When Github Copilot launched, Matt Shumer, Co-Founder and CEO of OthersideAI, warned about the threat of blindly trusting code generated by Copilot after it put the database password directly in code.28 Are there other security risks to worry about as we turn to AI for more generative tasks? Beyond security risks, there are also copyright concerns. Some worry that Copilot could reproduce chunks of existing code and violate the rule that open-source code can’t be used for commercial purposes without proper licensing.29 What are the bias implications of creative AI? On one level, using creative AI to enhance distributed innovation efforts might curtail bias. As Dan Spaulding, Chief People Officer at Zillow, puts it, “How much creativity and innovation have been driven out of the office because you weren’t in the insider group, you weren’t listened to, you didn’t go to the same places as the people in positions of power were gathering?”30 How might integrating creative AI into the early phases of the innovation process help balance the pressures to work from an office and some of the biases that come with it? Could it be used to overcome not only geographic and language barriers, but also to enable a broader set of employees with different skillsets and in different roles to participate? Additionally, in traditional brainstorming sessions, ideas offered by senior leaders or more outspoken team members often carry more weight – could AI-driven idea generation counter some of this bias? Perhaps, but a word of caution: creative AI is still AI and therefore vulnerable to AI bias. How can we prepare employees for the changes creative AI may bring? Creative AI is great at generating things but is not yet very good at identifying the best of what it generates. Given that, how should we expect creativity-oriented jobs and tasks to change? If there is a greater emphasis on sifting through results generated by creative AI rather than generating ideas from scratch, how should we train employees for this? How might design thinking change to incorporate creative AI? While these are still early days of creative AI, using AI to enhance innovation efforts shows a lot of promise – especially in a time where flexibility is needed more than ever. During the pandemic, we’ve seen higher rates of women dropping out of the workforce.31 Perhaps using creative AI to allow for more distributed innovation will have an important side benefit: enabling companies to attract and retain a more diverse workforce. Now may be the perfect time to innovate how we innovate.";https://bit.ly/38BoBow;

The unspeakable invasion of Ukraine at the behest of an unfettered lunatic have set our world sailing once again into uncharted territory. The rather flagrant truths of corruption and greed have an unfortunately visible outcome in the continuing and accelerated targeting of civilians – their homes , cities , villages , transport and all things essential for survival and on the impulses of one utterly depraved reptile fool. I cannot tell you what to think because as part of a larger campaign against democracies everywhere events unfolding since #Election2016 and the January 6th Insurrection have unfortunately revealed that average Americans are utterly dumb-as-rocks.

That last month of 2021 we had a couple of positive things just blow the doors off as far as what would be possible for research and music this year. It’s both exhilarating and intimidating when your forced to confront making changes that would have been a major stretch just a short while ago. One slightly painful thing is that after using social media like a sock drawer for years refocusing to garner tangible benefits of being on there highlights the time and distance between goofing off on social and leveraging it as a tool for doing real work.

Vision and hearing seem to constitute our largest dedicated sensory highways with respect to combined processing in our brains but we are immediately faced with conundrums : when these senses are absent or impaired neural plasticity takes up some slack and extends the dynamic range of other senses to compensate. We like to think that the physics that we know defines the limits to which this kind of adaptation can take place but in many cases said adaptations seem to exceed our expectations and we’re left unsure of exactly what’s going on. Part of the problem is that in spite of all our sophistication we still don’t know what human  consciousness actually IS – in and of itself. None of the folks that think they’ve got it all figured out have been able to use their claimed knowledge to build , much less demonstrate, a simulacrum of the thing that possesses capabilities of life forms much simpler than your average dog or cat. Dogs and cats themselves seem to know this and so deliberately on occasion exceed the capacities of their owners with complete disregard for these humans that truly believe the universe revolves around them. Thereby , of course, hangs a tale.  Our Universe has a built in sense of humor that is requisite for understanding the absurdities of existence.

American Music Research Center explores musical traditions of Pueblo, CO | American Music Research Center | University of Colorado Boulder;"
 The innovative Soundscapes of the People research project documents, preserves and engages  diverse musical and cultural influences in and around Pueblo, Colorado. “Pueblo Musicians” by Anthony Armijo on the wall of the Klamm Shell in Pueblo, Colorado. Photo credit: Nicole Maio. The American Music Research Center (AMRC) at the University of Colorado Boulder’s College of Music is breaking ground with its innovative Soundscapes of the People project, a comprehensive research effort in collaboration with local community stakeholders to document, preserve and engage with diverse musical and cultural influences in and around Pueblo, Colorado. Backed by a CU Boulder Research & Innovation Seed Grant and an Outreach Award from the Office of Outreach and Engagement—totaling $74,000—this year-long study will explore ways that musical traditions have served to bridge social, ethnic, urban/rural and religious identities. “Pueblo’s history is the nation’s history,” says AMRC Director and Professor of Musicology Susan Thomas, who leads the ethnomusicology project with CU Boulder Musicology Chair Austin C. Okigbo and Assistant Professor Xóchitl Chávez at the University of California, Riverside. “Pueblo is home to multiple underrepresented communities and their musical histories are largely undocumented by traditional institutions,” continues Thomas. “Working directly with community ‘memory keepers’—and documenting their musical experiences and knowledge through oral histories—we aim to address the lack of representation and inclusion in the history of Southern Colorado culture.”  Chávez agrees, “Music and sounds—key components of social identity and community-building—have shaped the history, politics and intersecting cultures of Pueblo, particularly since this borderland between the United States and Mexico collided with the industrial revolution.” Okigbo adds, “This project seeks to tell the story of the community and its peoples as a way to highlight their significant, but almost forgotten, contributions to the broader history of Colorado, the American West and United States, in general.” The stories, music and information gathered will eventually be publicly accessible through the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Rare and Distinctive Collections, as well as the CU Digital Library. The libraries are working on an agreement to also make them accessible through the Colorado State University Pueblo Library (CSUP). “This cooperation between CU Boulder and CSUP will be a ‘first’ for both institutions, and we’re really happy to be working with a local institution to ensure that the interviews and oral histories captured remain fully accessible to the community,” says Thomas. CSUP Dean of Library Services Rhonda Gonzales states that—by Spring 2022—CSUP undergraduate students will be working in the library's Special Collections and researched-focused Aztlán Center to work with the digital materials and transcribe interviews. Moreover, research results will inform K-12 curricular materials that will be made digitally available through both the AMRC and the Latino History Project—a public history initiative supported by CU Boulder’s School of Education—working with the AMRC to provide Colorado educators and the broader community with more resources for understanding the history and contributions of the Latinx community statewide. “Our research team views itself as a facilitator for the community to tell its own story,” concludes Thomas. “We’re delighted to work directly with Pueblo scholars and artists who’ve been committed to this work for years—like the Song of Pueblo project led by Juan and Deborah Espinosa, who worked with noted composer Daniel Valdez to create a multimedia experience with original music about Pueblo’s compelling history.  “This kind of collaboration is one way that CU Boulder can take an active role in supporting local communities across our state. At the same time, the resulting digital archive will be of high scholarly importance, offering researchers of the American West an unprecedented opportunity to ‘listen in’ on the ethnically diverse complexity of Southern Colorado’s social history.” All told, the project brings together an interdisciplinary team with expertise in musicology, ethnomusicology, ethnic studies and history that will work closely with culture-bearers from Pueblo’s musical community, local educators and civic leaders.

#Jazz is a music genre that originated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries along the south-east United State coast with #AfricanAmerican and #Cajun (#FrancoAmerican) communities living in #NewOrleans.  From its roots in #Blues and #Cajun #FrenchLanguage #FolkMusic - #Jazz developed its distinct musical style in the #SpeakEasies and #Bordellos of New Orleans.  By the late 1920's and early 1930's Jazz had followed Blues north – when #AfroAmerican #Labourers who lost their Jobs as the price of #Cotton and #Tobacco crashed, with #ShareCroppers displaced from their land – began seeking work in the factories and yards of industrialised Cities in Northern USA.  Once arrived, Jazz began to take root amongst #Black #Communities – especially in #NewYork.  Jazz is still viewed by many as 'America's traditional music' – especially by those living along the Atlantic Coast of the USA.

The Marsican Brown Bear (Orso Bruno - Ursus arctos arctos) is the symbolic logo of the Abruzzo National Park. Marsican Brown Bears are an Apennine subspecies, which is genetically different from the Alpine brown bears to the north, and is thus endemic to Central Italy. Recent scientific researches have estimated a population of about 40 individuals within the Abruzzo National Park boundary and surrounding areas.

The Marsican brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos, formerly Ursus arctos marsicanus), also known as the ""Apennine brown bear"", and orso bruno marsicano in Italian, is a critically endangered population or subspecies of the Eurasian brown bear, with a range restricted to the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, and surrounding region in Italy. The Marsican brown bear differs slightly from other brown bears in its appearance and winter hibernation habits. The bear’s popular name is derived from Marsica, a historic area of the modern-day region of Abruzzo where the bear has enjoyed a long and significant cultural presence.

European Brown Bears (Ursus arctos) are amongst the largest living carnivores and can grow to an enormous size, males up to 350kg, and females to 200kg.

Brown bears have a large global distribution which reflects their ability to adapt to a variety of habitats. There are estimated to be more than 200,000 brown bears worldwide, with approximately 6000 individuals in the Carpathian region of Romania. They are amongst the largest living carnivores and can grow to an enormous size, males up to 350kg, and females to 200kg, with the biggest on record being caught in Romania weighing 480kg.  Adult males tend to be on average 8 to 10% larger than females. They have good hearing, an excellent sense of smell and can live for up to 30 years.

Read more: -  https://lnkd.in/ePGFjsyi

Robin McKie Science Editor | Published: 14:25 Saturday, 16 April 2022

It is a weapon whose effectiveness was overtaken centuries ago by the gun and rifle. Yet the bow and arrow may deserve a prize place in the history of our species, say scientists. They believe archery could have been critical to Homo sapiens’ conquest of the planet, helping modern humans emerge from their African homeland tens of thousands of years ago.

Early archers would have been able to kill their prey at a considerable distance while at the same time giving their diets a protein boost without endangering themselves, say researchers. It has also become clear that bow-and-arrow technology is ancient, with some of the oldest arrowheads traced to caves in South Africa and dated to around 64,000 years ago.

Outside Africa, the earliest evidence of archery was some 48,000-year-old arrowheads found in a Sri Lankan cave two years ago. However, that date is now expected to be pushed back to around 54,000 years, after scientists – led by Ludovic Slimak of the University of Toulouse – revealed they had uncovered evidence that modern humans colonised the Grotte Mandrin cave in the Rhône Valley. Finds included a tooth of a modern human child and a set of tiny pointed stone tools that look very like arrowheads.

Slimak said his team still had to confirm that these tools were arrowheads but stressed that the technology would have given modern humans a key advantage over Neanderthals who then occupied Europe.

“An animal 100 metres away will think you are too distant to be dangerous and won’t move away,” Slimak told the Observer. “With a bow and arrow, you could pick it off easily. Equally importantly, you’ll be too far away for it to attack you if it is wounded and gets angry. So you can hunt safely and provide more protein for your group.”

Professor Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum, London, added that it was now clear that the bow and arrow was a technology that was invented at different times in different parts of the world, underlining its importance to our species’ spread.

“The crucial thing about making a bow is that you really need to know your materials. You have to pick a species of tree that has the right flexibility because the inside of a bow has to withstand considerable compression while the outside has to withstand stretching. You also need expert technicians to make the string, the arrowheads and the arrow shaft. The whole technology requires considerable expertise.”

Slimak discovered a long blade in Grotte Mandrin cave in the Rhone Valley.

MARCUS NJUGUNA | OCT 14, 2021

The first ever production V12 engine was used in Packard’s “Double Six” in 1912.

A twelve-cylinder piston engine with two banks of six cylinders arranged in a V shape around a common crankshaft is known as a V12. The V12 engine is more common than the V10 engine. They are, however, less common than V8 engines.

The first V12 engine was used in Packard’s “Double Six” in 1912. However, the engine was used in various luxury vehicles before World War II, including Cadillac, Packard, Lincoln, Franklin, Rolls-Royce, and Hispano-Suiza.

V12 engines first appeared in aircraft. The V12 design was quite popular in the newest and largest fighters and bombers at the end of World War I when V12 engines were produced by companies like Renault and Sunbeam.

German manufacturers Maybach and Daimler used V12 engines to power several Zeppelins. The Liberty L-12 was made by a number of different companies in the United States; the Curtiss NC was one of them.  Flying boats, such as the NC-4, the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic, using a set of four V12 engines.

The engines were employed in a variety of World War II fighters and bombers, including the Rolls-Royce Merlin, Klimov VK-107, and Allison V-1710 on the Allied side, and the Daimler-Benz DB 600 on the German side.

At the start of the war, the engines produced about 1,000 hp (0.75 MW), and by the end of the war, they were generating around 1,500 hp (1.12 MW). With the methanol-water injection, the German DB 605D engine produced 2000 hp (1.50 MW). With the advent of the jet engine, the use of piston engines in aircraft rapidly declined.

In 1904, the V12 engine was created for racing boats for the first time. The V12 quickly found its way into luxury cars, aircraft, and tanks due to its unrivaled performance. V12s were subsequently renowned for their outstanding performance in sports cars and Formula 1 racing.

Twelve-cylinder engines were used in a variety of luxury cars prior to WWII, including Cadillac, Packard, Lincoln, Franklin, Rolls-Royce, and Hispano-Suiza. The 1912 Packard ""Double Six"" is widely regarded as the first production V12 engine.

Doggerland: How did the Atlantis of the North Sea sink?

Read more: -  https://lnkd.in/e6Z6b7fy

23.12.2020

For a long time, scientists believed that a powerful tsunami destroyed Doggerland 8,200 years ago. Sediment analysis now suggests that the land once connecting Great Britain with the rest of Europe had a later demise.

Around 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, the sea level in northern Europe was still about 60 meters (197 feet) below what it is today. The British Isles and the European mainland formed a continuous landmass.

Where the North Sea is today, there were fertile meadows and forests through which hunter-gatherers roamed. The coast ran about 300 kilometers (186 miles) further north along an area of about 30,000 square kilometers (11,580 square miles) that received the name of ""Doggerland"" in the 1990s, called after a sandbank now located in the region.

Relatively large rivers crossed this landmass, but in a different way than we know today. The Elbe, for example, flowed into a large inland lake. The Rhine flowed from east to west over long distances. Before it reached the sea at the latitude of Brittany, the Thames flowed into it.

Sea levels have been rising since the last major advance of glacial ice peaked 18,000 years ago. A large land mass surrounding, and at least as big as, the UK is now below water. About 8200 years ago, the sudden draining of glacial Lake Agassiz in Canada caused global sea levels to rapidly rise by 3-9 feet. 

That, and a tsunami from a huge submarine landslide off Norway swamped ancient settlements in Doggerland, a landscape that once stretched without break from England to the Danish coast (the name comes from ""dogger,"" a 17th-century Dutch fishing boat). 

The tsunami is estimated to have been as high as 40 feet!  Essentially, most of an entire European country disappeared beneath the North Sea. A small remnant appears to have lasted another 700 years before it, too, disappeared beneath the waters. Researchers continue to meticulously map hundreds of square miles of this underwater country - and collect artifacts - looking for evidence of lost prehistoric encampments.

Has Russia’s offensive really ‘stalled on all fronts’ in Ukraine?  Military Analysts agree with the UK’s MOD suggestion that Putin’s original plan is failing - but still warn of much darker times ahead.

Russia has been sustaining ""incredible"" losses since the start of its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. State Department official, put the figure of casualties at more than 10,000 killed after the first twenty days since the attack was launched - and Ukrainian officials claim that between 19,000 and 20,000 troops have been lost in just over fifty days.

It is thought that Russia has lost hundreds of tanks within two months of invading Ukraine.  NATO Military experts put the losses down to the advanced anti-tank weapons which western nations have given to Ukraine, and to the poor way Russia has used its tanks.

Analysis: Chain Of Negligence Caused The Loss Of The Moskva Cruiser

Read more: -  https://lnkd.in/ecVfaH8R

The shock of the sinking of the Slava-class cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, continues to amaze military experts.  In the absence of a satisfactory evidence-based explanation for the event, there has been much speculation over the cause.  Although the actual reason for the ship's sinking is not known with certainty, it is clear that the flagship sank as a result of a chain of negligence, half of the crew died, and Russia's Naval pride was broken.

Why is Russia loosing so many of its Officer Class ?

Russia 'loses its 42nd high-ranking officer' as another Major General and Lieutenant Colonel are killed - taking the Staff Officer death toll in Putin's army to eight generals and thirty-four colonels.  An Onyx investigation has found that in a sample of 1083 Russian servicemen reported killed and whose identity has been verified, more than 20 per cent - one in five of their Human Capital loses - were officers.

The Russian command structure - inflexible and suspicious of any mid-level initiative - leads to a disproportionate level of top-brass deaths. Junior leaders cannot act independently and simply stop and wait for orders from senior officers and instructions to be confirmed - but Russia us losing the very Staff Officers and senior leaders who could potentially turn the campaign around.

Any outcome of Russia’s war in Ukraine will eventually lead to fundamental social, economic, political and ideological transformations in the post-Soviet space, argues Volodymyr Ishchenko |

Selective Breeding is the intentional and deterministic selection by man of those individuals with the most desirable characteristics to modify the gene pool of a brood stock or population.  

Domestication is the outcome of all the selection pressures on a population, both intentional selection for breeding and natural stochastic, genetic selection imposed by the facies or niche interaction of the ecology with the environment, which act to  modify the gene pool of a population.

Improving those desirable characteristics that contribute most to the survival of an individual or population - and reducing those undesirable characteristics that contribute to the elimination of an individual or population - improves the long-term prospect of the continuous existence and improvement of a population.

When approaching a wild litter of cats or dogs - some of the litter will be frightened and alarmed (flee response) and cower at the back of the den.  Others will be frightened and aggressive (fight response) - snarling at the strange humans in their space.  

Some of the litter, however, will not be afraid at all but be curious - and approach those strange humans to investigate.  It is these animals with a  bold and curious temperament which are selected for both the initial domestication of the first generation - and selective breeding of subsiquent generations.   Even today - animal breeders still preferentially select from litters those animals with a calm and curious temperament.

Selective breeding is the process by which humans use animal and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits - by choosing which animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have fertile offspring (same species) or infertile (different but related species - e.g. crossing a horse with a donkey results in a mule.

Due to the genetic diversity and physiological variability of hybrid breeds typically exhibit “hybrid vigour” - enhanced characteristics which are superior to those of both parents.   The early generations (f1t o f3) of hybrid breeds can differ widely in characteristics - markings, colours, size and temperament.  Selective hybrid, cross and back-breeding stabilises variation from about the forth or fifth generation (f4).

Selective breeding involves choosing parents with particular characteristics to breed together and produce offspring with more desirable traits - and fewer undesirable characteristics. Humans have selectively bred plants and animals for thousands of years since farming, animal domestication and husbandry (Neolithic) including: - 

• Dogs most probably evolved from wolves at a single location about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, a study suggests.

• Domestication of wild cats to breed domestic cats for controlling vermin around food stores

• Improvement of crop plants for better resistance to pests and diseases and higher yields.

Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 YBP, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. There is clear evidence that dogs were derived from grey wolves during the initial phases of domestication, and their collaboration provided survival advantages to both man and dog: -  

• Dogs most probably evolved from wolves at a single location about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, a study suggests.

• Previously, it had been thought that dogs were tamed from two populations of wolves living thousands of miles apart.

• Researchers studied DNA from three dogs found at archaeological sites in Germany and Ireland that were between 4,700 and 7,000 years old.

• These ancient canines share ancestry with modern European dogs.

• Domestication of Wolves to breed dogs for ambush-and-chase hunting - wounding weak prey animals and driving those animals until they dropped from loss of blood, shock or exhaustion.

• Hunting with wolves may have helped modern humans in Europe to compete with Neanderthals for the same resources - territory for gathering vegetation and small animals for carbohydrates , and hunting large prey animals for fats and proteins.

Dogs are humanity’s oldest friends, renowned for their loyalty and abilities to guard, hunt and chase. But modern humans may owe even more to them than we previously realised. We may have to thank them for helping us eradicate our caveman rivals, the Neanderthals.

According to a leading US anthropologist, early dogs, bred from wolves, played a critical role in the modern human’s takeover of Europe 40,000 years ago when we vanquished the Neanderthal locals.

“At that time, modern humans, Neanderthals and wolves were all top predators and competed to kill mammoths and other huge herbivores,” says Professor Pat Shipman, of Pennsylvania State University. “But then we formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal population in Eurasia.

As one example, the researchers suggest that climate stress in southern Africa could have been what led to the rise of H. sapiens, while H. heidelbergensis went extinct. Beyond suggesting that climate data played a role in human evolution, the study goes even further, arguing that shifts in human adaptation cannot be fully explained without recourse to a broader understanding of climatic factors affecting ecosystems.

SCIENCE | PETER DOCKRILL | 13 APRIL 2022

The course of human evolution over the last 2 million years was shaped by habitation shifts linked to astronomically driven climate change  , scientists suggest in a new study.

Using an unprecedented supercomputer simulation of Earth's climate as it transitioned through climatic shifts over the course of the Pleistocene epoch, researchers found that changes in variables such as precipitation and temperature were linked with how a range of different hominid species, including Homo sapiens, migrated, settled, dispersed or disappeared over eons of human prehistory.

""Even though different groups of archaic humans preferred different climatic environments, their habitats all responded to climate shifts caused by astronomical changes in Earth's axis wobble, tilt, and orbital eccentricity,"" says climate physicist Axel Timmermann from Pusan National University in South Korea.

The results add significant weight behind the argument that prehistoric episodes of climate change   helped to spur evolutionary developments in the Homo genus – a long suspected but nonetheless difficult-to-prove hypothesis, due to a lack of hard climatic data overlapping contemporaneously with discoveries of archaic humans in the fossil record.

""One of the most notable problems is that terrestrial records of habitat information – such as that obtained from sedimentary outcrops and paleolake drill cores – are often limited in terms of the time frames of data available,"" explains archaeologist Michael Petraglia from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, who wasn't involved with the study but is the author of a commentary on the findings.

To sidestep the issue, Timmermann and his team modeled changes in environmental conditions across Earth over a period of 2 million years, incorporating astronomically triggered climatic shifts due to Earth's movement, known as Milankovitch cycles.

The researchers then compared the data to the documented presence of several hominin species in the fossil record – including Homo erectus, H. heidelbergensis, and H. neanderthalensis, among others encompassing over 3,000 hominin fossils.

The results tell a complex story of how different hominin groups variously dispersed across Earth over time, but they also suggest that the dispersals (and contrasting periods of habitation in the same spot) were tied to climatic patterns affecting factors such as temperature suitability and food availability.

IASPM   » Andrew Goodwin Memorial Prize;"Andrew Goodwin was a key figure in the development of popular music studies.  His background was in media and cultural studies: he received his Ph.D. in Cultural Studies from the University of Birmingham and taught for many years in the Department of Media Studies at the University of San Francisco.  He was a pioneer of the scholarly analysis of music video (in his book, Dancing in the Distraction Factory. Music Television and Popular Culture, for example, which drew on his previous work on television) and an astute critic of the use of postmodern theory in popular cultural studies.  But his work also reflected his experiences as a working musician and critic (experiences explored in his entertaining Professor of Pop blog), and his articles on such topics as music technology and the concept of world music remain models of clear-eyed common sense and analytic insight, informed as much by practice as theory.   As a teacher, colleague and friend, Andrew was an untiring source of ideas, enthusiasm and support, and his untimely death, in September 2013, was a huge loss to all of us in IASPM.  The Andrew Goodwin Memorial Prize was established in 2014 as a fitting tribute to his generosity to younger scholars. Aim: To promote popular music research and to support new scholars. Eligibility: Postgraduate students who are currently registered at universities and colleges in the U.K. and Ireland and who are members of IASPM. Current students and IASPM UK-I members who submitted essays for the AGMP in previous years but were unsuccessful may apply again; however, they are not allowed to submit the same essay (or essay topic) twice. Previous winners of the AGMP may not apply again. Awarded for: Essay of 3,000 to 4,000 words, on any aspect of popular music from any disciplinary perspective. Prize: First prize is £1,000, with the runner-up receiving £500. Both the winner and runner-up essays will be published on the Andrew Goodwin Memorial Prize web page on the IASPM UK and Ireland website.

Flexible device could treat hearing loss without batteries | Mirage News;“Acoustic Core-Shell Resonance Harvester for Application of Artificial Cochlea Based on the Piezo-Triboelectric Effect”ACS Nano Some people are born with hearing loss, while others acquire it with age, infections or long-term noise exposures. In many instances, the tiny hairs in the inner ear’s cochlea that allow the brain to recognize electrical pulses as sound are damaged. As a step toward an advanced artificial cochlea, researchers in ACS Nano report a conductive membrane, which translated sound waves into matching electrical signals when implanted inside a model ear, without requiring external power. When the hair cells inside the inner ear stop working, there’s no way to reverse the damage. Currently, treatment is limited to hearing aids or cochlear implants. But these devices require external power sources and can have difficulty amplifying speech correctly so that it’s understood by the user. One possible solution is to simulate healthy cochlear hairs, converting noise into the electrical signals processed by the brain as recognizable sounds. To accomplish this, previous researchers have tried self-powered piezoelectric materials, which become charged when they’re compressed by the pressure that accompanies sound waves, and triboelectric materials, which produce friction and static electricity when moved by these waves. However, the devices aren’t easy to make and don’t produce enough signal across the frequencies involved in human speech. So, Yunming Wang and colleagues wanted a simple way to fabricate a material that used both compression and friction for an acoustic sensing device with high efficiency and sensitivity across a broad range of audio frequencies To create a piezo-triboelectric material, the researchers mixed barium titanate nanoparticles coated with silicon dioxide into a conductive polymer, which they dried into a thin, flexible film. Next, they removed the silicon dioxide shells with an alkaline solution. This step left behind a sponge-like membrane with spaces around the nanoparticles, allowing them to jostle around when hit by sound waves. In tests, the researchers showed that contact between the nanoparticles and polymer increased the membrane’s electrical output by 55% compared to the pristine polymer. When they sandwiched the membrane between two thin metal grids, the acoustic sensing device produced a maximum electrical signal at 170 hertz, a frequency within the range of most adult’s voices. Finally, the researchers implanted the device inside a model ear and played a music file. They recorded the electrical output and converted it into a new audio file, which displayed a strong similarity to the original version. The researchers say their self-powered device is sensitive to the wide acoustic range needed to hear most sounds and voices.

 'Crash Test' Whether, as Paul Virilio argues, every technology carries its own negativity - or, as Benjamin Bratton responds, every accident produces its own technology, the question is how this happens. Whilst systems are intended to work with seamless functionality, breakages expose power structures: who is listened to and who is not, what is protected, and what is not intended to be seen. Through the lens of wide-scale industrial scandals, Legacy Russells’ framework of ‘glitch feminism’, the history of destructive car testing, and more, this talk considers how complex systems break and fracture, and what other systems may be possible.  Bio Georgina Voss is an artist, writer, and educator.

We Chat With Musician, Record Label Owner + Artist Danny Wild of 'Moontown Records', 'Low Flung', 'Zonk Vision', 'Campsie Centre For Electronic Music Research' and A Slew Of Other Epic Stuff - The Aither;Select Page Oct 23, 2021 | Uncategorised Danny Wild is someone who is hard to both pin down and describe accurately, because he really does so many different things. I first saw him perform from within a Zonk Vision exhibition, with a camera strapped to his head, engaged in a kind of super-concentration often not seen. He’s probably most known for his label Moontown Records and his musical project Low Flung – Which often takes the form of healing ambient music.  Lately, he’s been focusing on a myriad of fascinating educational, musical and curatorial projects, and The Aither thought it was time to catch him to discuss it all with us. I first heard about your work when you were involved with the video collective Zonk Vision. For people who don’t know, what was Zonk Vision? Did you achieve what you set out to do? Zonk Vision was an AV art collective started by Jason Galea (King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s main artist), Greg Holden (Holden Hands / Greg Cooks) and myself. It was a massive colourful mess of video, animation and sound.  We ran sensory overloaded multimedia events all over Australia over the course of about 5 years (roughly 2010-15). Eventually we expanded out to a small group of people making quite direct, colourful abstract video art and music.  Honestly it was just about having fun presenting something unpolished and raw and I think we had fun with it. It was so raw you could see the scaffolding, the structure, the exterior and the interior simultaneously.  When we started, we had no idea what we were doing, obsessed with Paper Rad and Peter Burr’s Cartoon Xprez DVD series. Over the years I went through art school and gained a bit more context as to what we were doing and by that point things had started to slow down. Maybe one day it will return.  I made some solid friendships over that time. Some people who still remind me of the ZV flavour are Ben Jones, No One Special, Horse MacGyver, Brainbeau and Sarah Byrne. Your label, Moontown Records has been very prolific over the years, and tends to announce a collection of releases at once. How do you go about choosing what to release? Is it a kind of serendipitous or more organic process? Everything happens in a very organic way. For me, there needs to be a bit of connection and friendship there, it is a labour of love. Sometimes I want to end it, other times it’s all I can think about.  Because it is just me running things, momentum can be unpredictable at times. It happens, life and work gets in the way. For releases it’s hard to predict. I think if it flows naturally, it works.  The process of releasing music can take a long time. I like it to be as transparent as possible with releases and give the artists priority, assisting with things like getting their music onto streaming services and encouraging artists to have as much control as possible.  Due to the nature and scale of Moontown, I feel it has become a stepping stone for artists to move to bigger things and I like that. You create music under many aliases, Low Flung being the main proponent of you working solo. How does working alone compare to that of your more collaborative projects? I feel like all of my output is loosely connected, it often becomes hard to draw lines in the sand. But once again it comes down to capacity and energy.  Working solo means things can progress quickly, but there is less critical dialogue with collaborators. So in some ways the process of making an album might be quick, but to pull back with a critical eye can become time consuming.  I think Low Flung is my most personal output, more intimate. I treat the Low Flung output the same as my other projects however. Very fluid, overlapping and merging. More and more this happens, and more and more I don’t mind. You’re from Canberra originally but now live and work in Sydney. How has your creative life and output changed since you moved cities? The move from Canberra to Sydney came at a quite difficult time for me personally, but looking back it was the best thing I could have done.  My practice is concerned with mood and environment, so Sydney brought on some new spaces creatively. Sydney is a strange and potent beast, the heart of the colony. It is very diverse depending on where you are. Lots of wealth, and plenty of poverty. There is a pulse underneath the slick oil ocean air, and if you work hard enough to find it, it will stay with you forever.  Much like Canberra, people from different subcultures work together because they almost have to. I feel like Sydney and Canberra are unique like that. So for all of the above reasons, sometimes I love Sydney and sometimes I hate it. A healthy balance. I’ve been really interested in seeing how artists have been adapting during COVID where they are unable to exhibit or perform. I noticed you’ve been doing a few workshops online. How did that come about and how did it go? What was the impetus for this? Were you keen to share your knowledge about technology with interested parties? Covid has been very strange and difficult for most.  If there has been one solid positive takeaway for me, it would be the seemingly endless time to evaluate everything I do and ask why. Purpose, priority, future, past and present. I think this time has led me to realise that community is key. Knowledge should be shared, not kept. Which has led me to starting the Campsie Centre For Electronic Music Research, to bypass the gatekeepers of knowledge and demystify audio visual production.  Here at CCFEMR we produce audio, video, run live streams, do some graphic design and our latest initiative has been running tutorial sessions (Ableton Live and Modular Synth so far.) I love old tech and utilizing it has always been my priority (mostly due to not having money).  I have been using analogue/digital audio and video equipment for almost 15 years. A whole lot of mistakes were made during this time and I thought I could give people who are new to the space a leg up. I just started a Discord server to create a skill-share community which is connected to a Patreon. These launched Friday in an attempt to work towards a self-sustaining practice for my Low Flung output and the Campsie Centre For Electronic Music Research alike. Moontown TV is launching this Sunday, would you be able to tell us a bit more about that? Over the pandemic I have seen a bunch of online streams and gigs. While these have been great to watch and engage with, I found that many don’t experiment with what you can do with the medium. I created Moontown TV to fill a gap in live streams that features live sets, video art, short animations, performances and even takes on the classic cable TV format.

One in three music industry jobs were lost during pandemic - BBC News;"One in three jobs in the British music industry were lost during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report from trade body UK Music. The research said there were 69,000 fewer jobs in music in 2020 than in 2019 - a drop of 35% - due to the ""devastating impact"" of coronavirus. UK Music said the industry had been hit ""especially hard"" by the virus. Musicians themselves as well as people working in venues and recording studios were particularly affected, it said. Live music revenues collapsed by around 90% in 2020, according to the UK Music report, titled This Is Music 2021, which was published on Tuesday. ""The music creators and live music sectors experienced the greatest decline - the majority of those working in the industry are self-employed, and they have been hit especially hard by Covid-19,"" it said. It noted that while many were able to get support from the government furlough scheme, ""many were not eligible"". ""This has resulted in thousands of music creators, crew and others leaving the industry for other sectors,"" it continued. ""Many are still committed to a career in music, but necessity has meant finding alternative sources of income."" The music industry's workforce dropped from 197,000 to 128,000 in 2020 after growing for the preceding decade, it said. UK Music could not say how many of those jobs have returned in 2021, with most venues now back open after restrictions were lifted. With many venues having shut their doors last year, and events like Glastonbury Festival forced to cancel, the music industry's contribution to the UK economy fell by 46%, from £5.8bn in 2019 to £3.1bn in 2020, according to the research. The value of UK music exports also fell, from £2.9bn in 2019 to £2.3bn, the report said. UK Music called on the government to introduce measures including tax incentives to help the industry recover. ""The past 18 months have been exceptionally challenging for the UK music industry, with billions wiped off the value of the sector - but we are determined to look to the future and focus on recovery,"" said UK Music chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin. ""In a year when we've seen just how important music is to all our lives, it's more important than ever that we take the necessary steps to protect, strengthen and grow the industry."" In an introduction to the report, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the government's focus had so far been on ""rescue and reopening"". ""Now the priority is to ensure a strong recovery,"" she continued. ""The UK music industry is one of our country's great national assets, and I give my commitment that the government will continue to back it every step of the way."" Singer Becky Hill, who collaborated with David Guetta on the top three hit Remember earlier this year, said she had witnessed people close to her suffer ""massively"" during the pandemic. ""My partner works in events, and he'd started his brand new Weekender festival in Plymouth and that started in 2020. We put loads of money into it and obviously they had to cancel and they lost everything,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""It was a really tough experience to watch him and the other festivals he books for basically on their knees, and I saw a lot of people suffer with incredibly bad mental health, and it was really sad to watch.""

DMRN+16: Digital Music Research Network One-day Workshop 2021 - Digital Music Research Network;"We have confirmed two keynote speakers. Title: ""Sound on the brain - insights from functional neuroimaging and neuroanatomy"" Link to video at C4DM YouTube channel Title: ""Learning interpretable music representations: from human stupidity to artificial intelligence"" Link to video at C4DM YouTube channel  DMRN+16 is sponsored by The UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM); a leading PhD research programme aimed at the Music/Audio Technology and Creative Industries, based at Queen Mary University of London. A new AIM CDT call for PhD positions will open in December 2021. There will be at least 12 fully funded PhD positions on AI + music topics.     Keynote 1. Prof. Sophie Scott -Director, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL. Title: ""Sound on the brain - insights from functional neuroimaging and neuroanatomy"" Abstract In this talk I will use functional imaging and models of primate neuroanatomy to explore how sound is processed in the human brain. I will demonstrate that sound is represented cortically in different parallel streams. I will expand this to show how this can impact on the concept of auditory perception, which arguably incorporates multiple kinds of distinct perceptual processes.  I will address the roles that subcortical processes play in this, and also the contributions from hemispheric asymmetries.  Keynote 2: Prof. Gus Xia - Assistant Professor at NYU Shanghai Title: ""Learning interpretable music representations: from human stupidity to artificial intelligence"" Abstract Gus has been leading the Music X Lab in developing intelligent systems that help people better compose and learn music. In this talk, he will show us the importance of music representation for both humans and machines, and how to learn better music representations via the design of inductive bias. Once we got interpretable music representations, the potential applications are limitless. The Digital Music Research Network (DMRN) aims to promote research in the area of digital music, by bringing together researchers from UK and overseas universities, as well as industry, for its annual workshop. The workshop will include invited and contributed talks and posters. The workshop will be an ideal opportunity for networking with other people working in the area.    * Call for Contributions You are invited to submit a proposal for a ""talk"" and/or a ""poster"" to be presented at this event. TALKS may range from the latest research, through research overviews or surveys, to opinion pieces or position statements, particularly those likely to be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience. Due to the online format, we plan to keep talks to about 10 minutes each, depending on the number of submissions. Short announcements about other items of interest (e.g. future events or other networks) are also welcome. POSTERS can be on any research topic of interest to the members of the network. Posters will be displayed virtually via the online platform gather.town. The abstracts of presentations will be collated into a digest and distributed on the day.   * Submission Please prepare your talk or poster proposal in the form of an abstract (1 page A4, using the template PDF-DMRN+16-Template [PDF 155KB], Word-DMRN+16-Template [DOC 94KB], One-page Template LaTex [403KB]). Submit it via email to dmrn@lists.eecs.qmul.ac.uk giving the following information about your presentation:   * Deadlines Extended to Friday 26th November - Abstract submission deadline 29 Nov 2021: Notification of acceptance 17 Dec 2021: Registration deadline 21 Dec 2021: DMRN+16 Workshop Registration The event will be online, registration is mandatory (so we can give you access to gather.town).

Popular DJs 2021: Marshmello, David Guetta, Alan Walker & More;"DJ Mag has just announced the winners of their annual Top 100 DJ poll, with David Guetta once again taking the crown for the world’s no. 1 DJ.   Independently of the vote, the music research and analytics platform Viberate looked into the online popularity data of Electronic artists to see if and how the results match up. Why data? In a way, it’s the “objective popular vote”. Fans across the globe reward their favorite artists on a daily basis by streaming their music, viewing their videos, liking their social media posts, and buying their tracks – besides casting their votes in online polls. Viberate’s advanced algorithms take into account each artist’s social media and music channels, as well as radio airplay throughout the year. This makes for an unbiased and transparent overview of how popular an artist really is. Top findings include: Marshmello, David Guetta, Alan Walker, Calvin Harris, and The Chainsmokers are the top 5 most popular Electronic artists of the last 12 months. The Top 10 list is rounded off by Martin Garrix, Tiësto, Skrillex, DJ Snake, and Alok. Interestingly enough, the usual “crowd favorites”, such as Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Afrojack, and Armin van Buuren, did not make the Top 10 list. Dance is the most popular genre. 72% of the top 100 artists are Dance (EDM) artists, 10% are House artists, and other genres are less represented. Several artists have made a big leap in 2021 and entered the Top 100 chart. These include Imanbek (49th), Nightcrawlers and Riton (43rd and 47th, respectively), A7S (35th) and Topic (32nd). Collabs are the way to go. Thanks to the success of tracks such as “Friday” (Nightcrawlers & Riton), “Your Love” (A7S & Topic) and “Breaking Me” (A7S & Topic), the aforementioned artists have jumped as many as 800 places up the Electronic Artists chart. Memes work, too. South African artist The Kiffness placed 96th thanks to his musical renditions of “vibing cat”, “alugalug cat” and sea shanty memes, delighting audiences during the Covid-19 lockdown. The “Alugalug Cat” track alone was streamed more than 60K times on Spotify last week. Here’s the complete list of Top 100 Electronic artists according to Viberate: Marshmello

This presentation acts both as a technical guide to THE RHIZOME and a critique by its creator.  Born and based in Derby, Dr Corey Mwamba's commitment to jazz and improvised music in Britain and Ireland drives all aspects of his work, whether through making, presenting, promoting, or researching music.  Corey predominantly plays vibraphone and dulcimer, and uses audio processing software. Corey Mwamba is recognised as a highly creative improviser and composer working across a wide range of jazz and contemporary music. Corey won a PRSF/Jerwood Foundation Take Five artist development award in 2007; was short-listed for the Innovation category in the BBC Jazz Awards in 2008; and received nominations for ""Rising Star on Vibraphone"" in the 62nd, 63rd, 64th, 65th, 66th, 67th, and 68th DownBeat Annual Critics' Polls.

Four of them are lead from the University of Helsinki. The Academy of Finland has selected a total of eleven new Centres of Excellence. Four are lead from the University of Helsinki. In addition, PIs from the University of Helsinki participate in three Centres of Excellence lead from other organizations. A Centre of Excellence is a research community that is already at or striving for the international cutting edge of research in its field. CoEs may consist of one or more research teams working closely together under one joint research plan. Centres of Excellence lead from the University of Helsinki and their leaders include: Centres of Excellence in which University of Helsinki researchers take part: The call for Finnish Centres of Excellence attracted a total of 184 letters of intent. Of these, 34 applications were invited to the second call stage. The full applications were reviewed by international expert panels. The reviewers also interviewed representatives of the research teams invited to the second stage. In selecting the CoEs for the new programme, focus was placed on the international review, the interviews and the objectives of the programme. The decision-makers in particular examined that the research team applying for CoE status conducts excellent science and breakthrough research and contributes to scientific renewal. Emphasis was also placed on the possibilities of the team to rise to or stay at the international forefront in the field. Among the key selection criteria were also the impact of research beyond the scientific community and that the researchers and subjects of the CoE candidate can reinvigorate Finnish science. CoEs are jointly funded by the Academy of Finland, universities and research institutes. Funding is also made available through other sources.;https://www.miragenews.com/university-of-helsinki-participates-in-7-650932/;

The role of music in Cuban protests | CU Boulder Today | University of Colorado Boulder;"
 Music has always had a powerful influence on Cuban culture. Its unique blend of West African and European styles has made Cuba one of the richest and most influential music regions in the world. But Cuban music has also acted as a vehicle for social and political critique.  Run by a socialist government since 1959, Cuba has faced political dissent from its citizens throughout history. Cuban musicians have used their voices to critique their government and speak out against political, social and economic injustices. As a result, many musicians have been censured, arrested and detained for their political expression.  On July 11, 2021, Cuban citizens erupted into a series of protests against the Cuban government and the ruling Communist Party of Cuba. Thousands took to the streets in various parts of the island to protest the failing economy, the ongoing food and medicine shortage and the government's response, or lack thereof, to the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba.  The 11-J protests (as referred to by Cubans) are considered one of the country's largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, resulting in hundreds of arrests and calls for U.S. intervention by some Cuban Americans. Susan Thomas, a musicology professor and director of the College of Music’s American Music Research Center, studies popular music and arts culture both in Cuba and in the wider Cuban diaspora and their relationship to state policy and political change. She spoke with CU Boulder Today about the role musicians and artists played in the 11-J demonstrations and in Cuban protests throughout history.     Susan Thomas, director of CU Boulder's American Music Research Center   Musicians, especially singer-songwriters, have been a voice for public consciousness since the 1960s, pushing back against restrictions and abuses while continuing to work within the system. Artists positioned themselves as mouthpieces for the people, for the goal of free expression and better opportunity. But musicians have historically been supportive of socialist ideology. So while they wrote songs that might be critical of the way things were playing out, they always expressed that criticism within a strong support of socialist values.   But artists’ commitment to socialist ideals was not always enough. Censorship and blacklisting kept many artists from having access to venues or recording studios, and some were even imprisoned for their perceived deviance from ideological norms. In more recent years, some artists have used music to voice more direct criticisms of the government and faced severe censure from the state and even arrest and detention.  The kind of widespread eruption of dissatisfaction in the 11-J protests hadn’t been seen since before the 1959 Revolution. People on the island are fed up with shortages of food, medicine, housing and other basic necessities. They’re fed up with the government’s response to the economic and health impacts of COVID-19, and with the general lack of opportunities and government restrictions on information and freedom of expression.  What is interesting about the 11-J protests, compared to other Cuban protests in recent years, is that the demonstrations took place across the country. Even looking back just six months prior, a series of demonstrations in support of the San Isidro Movement––which protested government censorship in the arts––were mostly held in Cuba’s capital city of Havana.  The San Isidro Movement was also led largely by Cuba’s artistic elite: intellectuals, filmmakers, visual artists and musicians drawn from jazz and alternative music––genres viewed with relative favor by state institutions. In contrast, the 11-J protests stemmed from Cuba’s poor and working class––those without a voice, who neither identify as intellectuals or artists and whose musical tastes lean more toward the institutionally disdained, but incredibly popular, reggaetón genre.  The 11-J protests were quickly identified with a reggaetón song, “Patria y Vida” (“homeland and life”) that was created in early 2021 to criticize the government’s restrictions on artistic expression. It takes the revolutionary slogan “Patria o muerte” (“homeland or death”) and turns it on its head to illustrate Cubans’ desires for a life of possibility. The accompanying music video directly attacks government oppression, depicting scenes of police detention and abuse. When the protests erupted in July, “Patria y Vida” filled the air and its title appeared on makeshift signs all over the island. Cuba has always been home to a wide variety of musical practices, some of which have been embraced by state and commercial institutions, and some of which have not. This tension really exploded over the last two decades as reggaetón became increasingly popular across the country. Reggaetón was associated with marginalized communities, especially with darker-skinned Cubans from the eastern side of the island. It was viewed disdainfully by some music and institutional elites, who perceived its deep Caribbean roots as “foreign,” and who pointed to the amatuer status of disenfranchised musicians as proof of the music’s artistic deficit. It has been roundly criticized as “marginal,” vulgar, misogynistic and foreign, and efforts were even made by state institutions to ban the playing of reggaetón in public spaces.  In the 11-J protests, thousands of marginalized Cubans––people who are often invisible in state discourse––took to the streets. So the fact that a reggaetón song, “Patria y Vida,” became the anthem for the protests is very significant.   Subscribe to CUBT  for Alerts Administrative eMemos Buff Bulletin Board Events Calendar CU Boulder Today is created by Strategic Relations and Communications.

Musique : selon une étude, écouter du métal ferait grossir;"Rubriques et services du Figaro  Rubriques et services du Figaro Nos journaux et magazines Les sites du Groupe Figaro En partenariat avec Qobuz, plateforme musicale haute qualité Your browser does not support iframes. Cela n'aurait donc rien à voir avec la bière. Des chercheurs très sérieux de l'université d'Aarhus au Danemark suggèrent que nos choix musicaux influencent nos penchants alimentaires. Et le hard rock ne serait donc pas le plus diététique d'entre eux... Le heavy metal - littéralement «métal lourd»- n'a jamais aussi bien porté son nom ! Selon une étude, les amateurs de Rammstein, Metallica ou encore Iron Maiden - des hommes massifs, aux cheveux longs, fervents amateurs de bière comme le veut la légende - auraient tendance à se tourner vers des aliments plus gras que les amateurs de reggae ou de jazz. À lire aussiUne mère fan de metal baptise ses enfants Metallica, Slayer et Pantera L'université danoise d'Aarhus a mis en lumière que nos choix musicaux auraient une influence sur nos choix alimentaires. Dans ce cas précis, le hard-rock inciterait à consommer des aliments gras, alors que la musique classique, pour ne prendre que cet exemple, pousserait à se tourner vers des aliments sains. La musique rapide et forte, caractérisée par de lourdes dissonances et distorsions, excite tellement l'auditeur qu'elle l'incite à se gaver d'aliments gras. Une musique classique calme peut inciter les auditeurs à faire des choix modérés et raisonnables Ces recherches ont été menées en Chine et au Danemark sur un échantillon de 215 personnes. Il s'agissait de comprendre les effets d'une bande sonore spécifique sur les choix nutritionnels et les mouvements oculaires chez des consommateurs de cultures différentes. «Généralement, lorsque nous pensons à la nourriture, nous pensons au goût, à l'arôme et, bien sûr, à la vue, mais le son a été, je dirais, sous-estimé» explique l'un des chercheurs de l'étude Danni Peng-Li. Les auteurs s'appuient sur l'analyse de la médiation, discipline de psychologie sociale qui met en évidence les processus à travers lesquels un facteur influence le fonctionnement psychologique ou le comportement humain pour appréhender le phénomène. Un système de suivi oculaire des 114 participants chinois et des 105 participants danois a été mis en place en laboratoire afin d'étudier vers quels aliments ils se tournaient. Les auteurs concluent qu'il est possible de choisir stratégiquement des sons pour influencer la prise de décision des consommateurs et guider leur attention vers de la nourriture plus saine. Mais pas de panique une autre étude datant de 2015 montrait qu'écouter du métal pouvait rendre plus calme. Le métal, bon pour le moral serait donc une autoroute pour l'enfer, comme le chante AC/DC pour le corps... Yves Démiurge

                         Plus que la musique elle-même, cela a sans doute plus à voir avec les différents milieux sociologiques des auditeurs. La musique classique touche probablement un public socialement aisé. Le reggae touche un public de fumeurs de kékés anémiques à tendance végétarienne. Le métal touche plutôt un public viril qui lève le coude facilement. Patrice FERLET

Video game giant supports PhD student’s non-linear time in music research - University of Gloucestershire;"Matt Deegan, a Music and Sound PhD student at the University of Gloucestershire, has been awarded $10,000 by US video game giant Epic Games, to support his innovative research on non-linear time in music composition using computer game software. Unlike in films or on TV, where the musical score is written with a specific scene in mind and will be the same each time it is played back, sound for a computer game is dependent on user input and will be different each time. This means that music for the gaming industry, now worth an estimated $300 billion worldwide, needs to be interactive and adaptive – in other words, non-linear – because it is impossible to predict how long a player will spend trying to solve a puzzle or defeat an enemy. Turning the situation on its head, Matt is carrying out research to find out how computer game software can be utilised to write non-linear music as the game is being played, providing the game player with a unique experience every time they play. Matt’s study has received $10,000 in funding from Epic Games’ $100 million MegaGrants scheme that aims to support game developers, enterprise professionals and media and entertainment creators. Matt said: “To say I was thrilled that my application for funding was successful would be an understatement. The grant from Epic Games will help fund my PhD studies and purchase key equipment to use in my research. “Computer games are big business and have grown inexorably since the 1970s. They are prevalent in our daily lives and exist on computers, tablets and mobile phones and follow different formats such as 2D, 3D, virtual and augmented reality. “Sound design and music are an integral part of these formats and are created to enhance each game. There is a wide variety of sound, from explosion sound effects to full orchestral music scores, aimed at enhancing the player’s journey through the game. “The idea of my research is to explore the possibilities surrounding music and sound creation using Epic Games’ Unreal Engine game development software. “This software provides sophisticated tools for a range of elements including game development, virtual, augmented and mixed realities, film, video and live events, architecture, engineering and construction, and product design. “No one can predict where technology will take us and how it will be consumed, and investigating audio creation and manipulation using this technology is not only exciting, but integral to future development.”

Global Consumption of K-pop Masculinities: Panel at Society for Ethnomusicology (Oct, 2021) – Thomas Baudinette;"Together with colleagues Dr. Stephanie Choi at NYU and Dr. Kristine M Santos at Ateneo de Manila University, I will be presenting at the Virtual Annual Meeting of the Society for Ethnomusicology on October 28-31. Sponsored by the Association for Korean Music Research, our panel is entitled “Global Consumption of K-pop Masculinities.” It will be held virtually, for paying attendees, on Saturday October 30 at 10.45am-12.15pm (GMT-4; Eastern Daylight Savings Time). Here are our presentation titles: Here is the panel abstract: While certain Western media commentators often describe K-pop male idol singers as “effeminate” or “androgynous” as a way of denigrating the K-pop music, academic works have striven to empower singers through terms such as “soft masculinity” that shed a positive light on Asian masculinities which have traditionally been emasculated and/or rendered invisible. Our panelists, however, depart by rejecting such Western-oriented theorizations and attempt to diversify theoretical understandings of the gender presentations of K-pop idol performers. First, Baudinette challenges the notion of “soft masculinity” by demonstrating how reducing contemporary Korean masculinity to notions of softness tied to heterosexual female fandom limits understandings of how K-pop may be locally received. Instead, as Baudinette presents in his ethnographic research, K-pop male idols’ media presence shape different gender relations with Japanese gay male consumers. Kristine Santos’s work demonstrates how K-pop male idols, as global media texts, are recreated as queer figures within Philippine K-pop fandom. Detached from their original heteronormative context, K-pop male idols are reimagined as Filipino locals in the alternative universe of K-pop shipping, a queer fan activity that serves as an empowering practice for local K-pop fans in the Philippines. Stephanie Choi explores a case study of the reciprocal homoerotic performances between Korean heterosexual female fans and their male idols. Choi argues that Korean female fans’ homoerotic fanfic narratives and male idols’ homoerotic fan service performances do not emancipate the Korean LGBT+ community but rather reaffirm South Korea’s heteropatriarchy.

Listen To This Song!

Research by Mindlab International shows that listening to this one song — “Weightless” by Marconi Union — resulted in a striking 65 percent reduction in participants’ overall anxiety, and a 35 percent reduction in their usual physiological resting rates.

Remarkably, the song was actually constructed to do so. “Weightless”, was created in collaboration with sound therapists. Its carefully arranged harmonies, rhythms, and bass lines help slow a listener’s heart rate, reduce blood pressure and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

Sound therapies have long been popular as a way of relaxing and restoring one’s health. For centuries, indigenous cultures have used music to enhance well-being and improve health conditions. Now, neuroscientists out of the UK have specified which tunes give you the most bang for your musical buck

The IASPM/WIM 2022 joint conference welcomes scholarly research from all disciplines that engages with the changing contexts of musical practice experience—music making, the circulation of music, musical pedagogy and fandom, music and social movements, and various other dimensions of musical engagement—playing, dancing, streaming, listening. For more than a year, the global pandemic has highlighted and accelerated the destabilization of practices and institutions of music making and partaking. The enforced hiatus from many aspects of public life offers a chance to evaluate music practices. Which have continued? Which ones will resume? Which ones may not return, at least not as they were? While we welcome papers on any aspects of popular music, we encourage papers that align with the conference subthemes: The Impact of the Global Pandemic and Reopening; Pause and Resumption in Popular Music; and Working in Music.  Full details can be found in the CFP below. Update: We can announce that Dr. William Cheng is the keynote speaker for the conference.  Dr. Cheng is Chair and Professor of Music at Dartmouth College, a musicologist and classical music performer who has published across an unusually wide range of music research. His most recent book, Loving Music Till It Hurts contains a series of case studies examining how moral discourses of music interact consequentially with other authoritative discourses, such as ability, gender, race, and class. Please take a look at his website for further information: https://willxcheng.com/ IASPM-Canada et le réseau de recherche Working in Music (WIM) invitent les personnes qui le souhaitent à soumettre un résumé de présentation pour leur conférence conjointe, qui se tiendra à l’Université Western Ontario, à London (Ontario), au Canada en mai 2022. La conférence conjointe IASPM/WIM 2022 accueillera la recherche universitaire de toutes les disciplines s’intéressant aux contextes changeants de l’expérience et de la pratique musicale : jouer, danser, diffuser et écouter — de la création musicale, à la circulation de la musique, en passant par la pédagogie musicale, les pratiques des fans, les mouvements sociaux, ainsi que d’autres dimensions de l’engagement musical. Depuis plus d’un an, la pandémie mondiale a mis en évidence et accéléré la fragilité des institutions de création et pratiques musicales. L’interruption forcée de nombreuses activités musicales publiques rend possible un regard différent sur celles-ci. Lesquelles ont continué ? Lesquelles reprendront ? Lesquelles ne reviendront peut-être pas, du moins pas telles qu’elles étaient auparavant ? Bien que les présentations portant sur tous les aspects de la musique populaire soient acceptées, celles qui s’insèrent dans la foulée des sous-thèmes de la conférence sont particulièrement encouragées: L’impact de la pandémie mondiale et la réouverture; Pause et reprise en musique populaire; Le travail et la musique. Mise à jour: Il nous fait plaisir d’annoncer que le Dr Williams Cheng sera conférencier invité lors de l’événement. Professeur en musique à Dartmouth College, Dr Cheng est musicologue et interprète de musique classique. Il a publié sur un large éventail de thématiques de recherche en musique.

Music, as the form of art whose name derives from ancient myths, is often thought of as pure symbolic expression and associated with transcendence. Music is also a universal phenomenon and thus a profound marker of humanity. These features make music a sphere of activity where sacred and popular qualities intersect and amalgamate. In an era characterised by postsecular and postcolonial processes of religious change, re-enchantment and alternative spiritualities, the intersections of the popular and the sacred in music have become increasingly multifarious. In the book, the cultural dynamics at stake are approached by stressing the extended and multiple dimensions of the sacred and the popular, hence challenging conventional, taken-for-granted and rigid conceptualisations of both popular music and sacred music. At issue are the cultural politics of labelling music as either popular or sacred, and the disciplinary and theoretical implications of such labelling. Instead of focussing on specific genres of popular music or types of religious music, consideration centres on interrogating musical situations where a distinction between the popular and the sacred is misleading, futile and even impossible. The topic is discussed in relation to a diversity of belief systems and different repertoires of music, including classical, folk and jazz, by considering such themes as origin myths, autonomy, ingenuity and stardom, authenticity, moral ambiguity, subcultural sensibilities and political ideologies.

Ofsted publishes its research review on music;The UK’s professional body for musicians and subject association for music We're here for you. Get in touch by email: [email protected], or call 020 7221 3499. 13 July 2021 Ofsted has published its research review on music as part of a series of subject-specific reviews. The review sets out the literature which informs the way Ofsted think about high-quality music education in the context of the education inspection framework (EIF). Subject reports based on evidence from ‘deep dives’ in the EIF will be published later in the year. The research reviews aim to ‘support and inform those leading the thinking on subject education’ in schools and Ofsted have selected literature that ‘aligns with the established principles for quality of education’ as outlined in the EIF. It is important to note that Ofsted have said that the review identifies ‘features that might sit behind high-quality curriculums’ and that it is ‘not a simple checklist of activities that we expect to see in school music (and should not be made into one).’They have previously stated in their principles behind research reviews and subject reports that they 'do not specify curriculum content or a preferred curriculum model'. We are currently reviewing the document in order to provide our members with analysis of its contents and we will be sharing more detailed information shortly. However, to summarise, the music subject review examines a range of issues within curriculum music including progression, pedagogy, assessment and subject and school leadership. It starts from that assumption that ‘a central purpose of good music education is for pupils to make more music, think more musically and consequently become more musical’. It acknowledges the decline in the number of pupils taking music at key stages 4 and 5 over the past 10 years as well as the reduction in key stage 3 provision and the amount of musical training offered to trainee primary teachers. It also recognises that reduced curriculum provision has led to lower staffing levels which can affect the support for a school’s ‘rich musical life’. As a result of this, Ofsted state that ‘it is more important that ever for schools to find ways that put high-quality music at the core of the curriculum’. Commenting on the review, Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, said, ‘Music is part of the curriculum but simply ‘doing’ music is not enough. We shouldn’t be satisfied with just having music on the timetable. We need to be ambitious about what we expect for music in the classroom and make sure that time is well used. So I hope the review provides helpful guidance for schools on designing and developing a high-quality music curriculum.’ The music review outlines some common features that Ofsted say schools may wish to consider when developing their music education provision.

Sonic Residencies support art’s role in changing how, and under what conditions knowledge is produced, communicated and archived, in societies reflecting African worlds. 
     The four-week Sonic Residency is located in Stellenbosch and environs. Residents are encouraged to explore how their sonic work can develop in relation to the locality in which they are based for four weeks. The section on ‘Sonic Locality’ (on this website) provides fragmentary, and selective visual information on the wider locality of Stellenbosch, beyond the conventional, tourist promotional images of vineyards and white-washed, gabled buildings. In some images on the website, persons are photographed, and their names and/ or stories are provided in the accompanying written observations (accessed when website visitors click on the images). These observations that accompany the images acknowledge some of the historical, political and social aspects of embodied landscape and the flows of agency between place-space-sound-music. Monetary provision is made for travel, subsistence, and Residency research-production. Artists-in-Residence have the choice to be accommodated in Stellenbosch, or arrange for alternative options, for the duration of their 4-week Residency. Sonic Residents will have access to a modest studio space and Stellenbosch University library facilities and research archives. (Regrettably artists’ fees are not provided.)   The Sonic Residency programme creates a space for public conversations and artistic interventions and experimental encounters in public life. Artists-in-Residence are asked to present a colloquium to the Stellenbosch University’ broader research community; and create a performance-based or dialogical public intervention during their month-long Sonic Residency. Artists-in-Residence receive a modest research- production grant to support their research and to realise their live public intervention, which can take the form of presentation, performance, publication, recording, installation, exhibition, conversation or provocation, to name a few modes of contemporary artistic practice.

"Confessions of a Coward |
Web Exclusives | Daily Writings From Our Top Writers | First Things";"If you want this website to work, you must . Early in April, with the publication of the May issue of   First Things  , I stepped out from behind the pseudonym Spengler to begin arguing my more considered ideas under my own name. The experience has been an interesting one: constricting in some ways and yet freeing in others. My Spengler columns actually began as a joke. In 1997 the   Asia Times   asked me to write a humor column, and the name Spengler seemed a funny touch: the author of    The Decline of the West    as a comic writer for an Asian daily. The print edition of the newspaper soon went under, but I revived the persona for the online-only edition in 1999. Contrary to my expectations, it won an audience and became a vehicle for more than I had originally imagined it would be. One reason for the Spengler name was that I was working on Wall Street at the time, and a pseudonym allowed me to keep my two worlds separate. But I soon found that the Spengler mask also gave me freedom to employ striking ideas and provocative formulations¯to take intellectual as well as literary risks. Along the way, I developed a core thesis that the response of nations to their own mortality was the key to understanding the great events of our time, and the existential theology of Franz Rosenzweig provided unique insights into geopolitics. What’s more, I had a great deal of fun writing as Spengler. What I didn’t have was a great deal of responsibility. Not that those columns were irresponsible; looking back on a decade of writing as Spengler, I see many misfires and over-phrasings, but little to revise in the core thesis to which I came. Still, when writers take on a successful mask, they also shrug off a certain burden of accountability. A small group of friends slowly convinced me that to argue publicly for things one really believes requires standing behind them publicly. It demands a commitment, and to continue arguing under a pseudonym eventually came to seem to me an attempt to have it both ways. Yes, I’ve found that the emergence from the Spengler name has constricted my writing in some ways: forcing me to be more considered and more careful in how I say what I want to say. But I’ve found that the rejection of pseudonym has, in another way, freed me¯freed me to make a fuller commitment to the ideas I think worth fighting for in the public square. Even during the Spengler years, I never entirely stopped writing under my own name, penning financial columns under my real byline in   Forbes   magazine and publishing research for Wall Street firms. But all that was different from the writing I’ve begun to do now. This experience¯disappearing for a decade behind a mask and then reemerging¯remains an odd one. Trying to evaluate it, I’ve found myself forced to retrospection: a looking back at some of the ways in which I’ve used and misused my life. Can you bear a little more autobiography? The critic Harold Bloom once argued that the characteristic American religion is a species of gnosticism, and I have good reason to believe it to be true, having spent some years¯from 1976 to 1986¯in a gnostic cult under the leadership of a man named Lyndon LaRouche. Was it all bad? In March 1984, Norman A. Bailey, then special assistant to President Reagan for international economic affairs, told NBC news that the LaRouche organization had “one of the best private intelligence services in the world.” The supply-side publicist Jude Wanniski¯my future business partner¯had introduced me to Bailey in 1981, when I ran the economics desk for LaRouche’s publications. Among my colleagues were several researchers who went on to distinguished careers. The Asia desk chief, for instance, was Dan Sneider, afterward a distinguished correspondent for the   Christian Science Monitor   and the   San Jose Mercury  , and now director of a university research institute. European economics was handled by Laurent Murawiec, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute; the Middle East desk was headed by Bob Dreyfuss, now a regular contributor to the   Nation  ,   American Prospect  , and   New Republic  ; and the chief science writer was Jonathan Tennenbaum, a brilliant mathematician who had taught at the University of Copenhagen. We were all about thirty, and most of us were Jewish. The question, of course, is what were a group of young Jews doing in the company of a cult leader with a paranoid view of the world and a thinly disguised anti-Semitic streak. Here is one answer: We were all long-in-the-tooth student radicals. LaRouche’s organization was the flotsam washed up by the wave of the collective madness that had swept through the youth of the world in 1968 and left many of its participants maladapted to ordinary life for years afterward. During the 1960s, LaRouche was a one-man Trotskyite splinter group, teaching free-lance courses on Marxist economics at whatever venue would have him. He culled student radicals with an intellectual bent who were repelled by the mindlessness endemic on the left in the late 1960s. LaRouche’s pitch was insidious: How can you justify yourself morally unless you know that what you are doing is right? There existed a science of mind, LaRouche claimed, that would enable the adept to reach the right conclusion. We were atheists, of course¯the concept of “religious intellectual” was unknown to me in my student days at Columbia and the London School of Economics¯and the idea that truth might come through revelation seemed beyond snickering. The Vietnam War, the crisis in race relations, and the cracks in the economic structure of the 1970s persuaded us that we had to do something and that indifference was morally inexcusable. And that is where LaRouche had us. His intellectual method resembled the old tale about stone soup: Having announced that he had the inside track on the hidden knowledge that underlay Western civilization (one of his essay was titled “The Secrets Known Only to the Inner Elites”), he attracted a small parade of intellectual orphans, whom he then put to elaborating the details. By the late 1970s he had collected some highly credentialed acolytes, including a group of physicists and mathematicians at his front organization, the Fusion Energy Foundation. LaRouche claimed to trace a tradition of secret knowledge across the ages, from Plato and Plotinus, through the Renaissance, and down to the German scientists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Of course, that raises a question: If there exists this kind of knowledge, then why isn’t it universally shared? The reverse side of the gnostic page is paranoia: There must be a cabal of evil people who prevent the dissemination of the truth. In LaRouche’s Manichean view of the world, a conspiracy had suppressed the truth in the service of evil oligarchs. Starting with Aristotle, it continued through to the nominalists, the British empiricists, and that supposed pinnacle of modern evil, Bertrand Russell. The Venetian Inquisition, the British Empire, the Hapsburg family, the Rockefellers, and the Trilateral Commission all figured variously in this grand conspiracy against LaRouche’s supposed intellectual antecedents. Jewish banking families kept popping up in LaRouche’s accounts of the evil forces. You might think¯you should think¯that this would have sent us running for the exits. But, Godless and faithless, we were all possessed by a fear of being Jewish, and LaRouche offered us a rock to hide under. LaRouche feigned a sort of philo-Semitism, praising marginal figures who could be fit into his mold: the Platonist Philo of Alexandria, for example, and the German rationalist Moses Mendelssohn¯Jews, that is, who sounded more like Greek philosophers than like Jews. He also portrayed himself as the opponent of Nazi tendencies that lurked everywhere. In a caricature of the   reductio ad Hitlerum  , everything he didn’t like pointed to the Nazis. The economist Milton Friedman, whose students had advised the Pinochet regime in Chile, must be a fascist because LaRouche didn’t like his economics, and I coauthored a book with LaRouche in 1978 with that silly allegation. LaRouche’s anti-Semitism was rarely in the open, but it often lurked just beneath the surface. Sometime in the early 1970s, he had played political footsy with the Liberty Lobby, a group headed by the anti-Semite and Holocaust denier Willis Carto. In a Carto-influenced article LaRouche later tried to suppress, he put the number of Jewish dead at around 1.5 million. I knew about all this, and I looked the other way. In 1978, I did a study for LaRouche of the economics of the narcotics traffic. The numbers I crunched showed that narcotics was a hundred-billion-dollar-a-year business¯not a controversial conclusion today, but at the time it seemed startling. LaRouche took my quantitative study and combined it with the paranoid musings of other researchers into a book,   Dope, Inc.  , that had unmistakable anti-Semitic overtones. I knew about this, too, and again I looked the other way. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, LaRouche was doing well, with a pocket publishing empire, a more-or-less accepted scientific front in the Fusion Energy Foundation, and a remarkable capacity to raise money (a good deal of which, it later turned out, was obtained by fraud). Nonetheless, within a few years nearly all his key people had quit. Once they began to engage the real world at a serious level, they broke free of LaRouche’s spell. For my part, I owe a great deal to Norman Bailey, then director of plans at the National Security Council. My political education began in his lair at the old Executive Office Building in 1981, when he explained to me that the United States would destroy the Soviet Empire by the end of the 1980s. After I became convinced that the Reagan administration knew what it was doing, my break with LaRouche was inevitable. He cashiered me as economics editor for his publications in 1982, for the offense of predicting (correctly) that the Reagan reforms would bring about an economic recovery (since if the American economy was on the mend, it did not need a savior like LaRouche). But I was still stuck emotionally in LaRouche’s flypaper. I moved to Europe, consulted for Bailey, and pursued musical research under the auspices of another LaRouche front, the Schiller Institute, until 1986. I had grown up as a red-diaper baby in a secular Jewish household (although my parents put me through the motions of a Bar Mitzvah at a Reconstructionist synagogue). I joined the left-wing Zionist youth organization Hashomer Hatzair and spent a summer on a kibbutz in Israel where the Israeli flag flew underneath the red flag of international socialism. Like so many leftist Jews, I came to believe that only a universal solution to humanity’s problems would solve the problems of the Jews, and the more universal the solution, the less Jewish. In plain English I was afraid to be Jewish: The less Jewish I was, and the more universal, the less likely I would be to be killed for being Jewish. And yet, physical fear in the background of the Holocaust was only one consideration. Another, deeper fear kept me at a distance from Judaism. My only sense of the sacred had come from classical music, the great avocation of my adolescence. The over-representation of Jews in classical music is no accident: Jews who cannot bring themselves to acknowledge God sometimes find music a safer means by which to evoke religious feelings without the fearful demands of encountering a personal God. To approach the sacred, Jewish tradition admonishes, is both exalting and dangerous, and it is less frightening to look for the sacred in Mozart’s sonatas than on Mt. Sinai. I had studied piano intensively and composed a bit while young, and I continued my studies through college. This bound me to LaRouche more closely than many of his other dupes, for he was a great aficionado of classical music, using the ill-gotten proceeds of his fund-raising machine to sponsor public as well as private concerts by first-class musicians. Around 1985, the ugly awareness that I had spent almost a decade in a gnostic cult coincided with a dark time in my personal life. Deeply depressed, I sat at the piano one night, playing through the score of Bach’s St. Matthew Passion, and came to the chorale that reads: “Commend your ways and what ails your heart to the faithful care of Him who directs the heavens, who gives course and aim to the clouds, air and wind. He will also find a path that your foot can tread.” For the first time in my life, I prayed, and in that moment, I knew that my prayer was heard. That was a first step of   teshuva  ¯of return. I worked for Bailey’s consulting firm after he left government service in 1984, and that paid for my graduate studies in music theory at the doctoral program at City University. Still, it took me a long time to find my way back to religious practice. I began studying the Jewish sources and joined a synagogue in 1993. A.J. Heschel’s book    The Sabbath    began my slow accommodation to Jewish observance: Reading his account of the Sabbath, I kicked myself for thirty-five wasted years. Still, it was not until I began to study Franz Rosenzweig’s    The Star of Redemption     during the early 1990s that I was able to reconcile my experience of prayer with my sense of the sacred in music. By then I had published academic articles on Renaissance music theory, including a 1989 study in the Vatican’s music journal about Nicholas of Cusa’s contribution. Studying the origins of Western classical music also helped me put religious things in perspective. Magnificent as it is, music remains a human construct, with a hint of divine inspiration in some cases, but not a substitute for God. The great works of Western classical music are not revelation, but they are perhaps the next best thing. Next best, however, no longer seemed good enough. Rosenzweig may not be the best introduction to Judaism, but he was probably the only theologian who illuminated the path that ran from where I began to where I needed to go. The religious poems of Heinrich Heine, written during his final illness, were also a source of strength. These two German Jews who had returned to Judaism in adulthood were my guides. And Heine’s take-no-prisoners prose became the conscious model for acerbic style I used in the Spengler columns. In the meanwhile, the part-time employment in financial analysis that had paid for my graduate education during the 1980s blossomed, to my surprise, into a full-fledged career. By 2002 I came to head debt research at Bank of America and sit on the bank’s fixed-income executive committee. Exile among the fleshpots of Wall Street had its benefits, but I had other ambitions that would find some expression in the Spengler columns for the   Asia Times  ¯and now have found more in writing under my own name and working at   First Things  . Looking back over it all, I see that though I was born Jewish, I am nonetheless a late convert to Judaism as a religion¯and a convert from the worst sort of religious background. Heine once quipped that the purpose of every memoir is to lie, and he cited Rousseau as an example. Rousseau had used his memoirs to represent himself as a monster for having consigned his natural children to orphanages. But, Heine claimed, Rousseau made himself out to be a monster in order to cover up the more humiliating fact that he was impotent and the children he sent to the orphanage weren’t his to begin with. In reviewing my own missteps in life, I feel that temptation to represent myself as a monster in order to cover up something even more painful: I was a coward. I was afraid of being Jewish. Everything else is rationalization. My intellectual life really began only a quarter-century ago when I reconciled myself to being Jewish. The truth is that I did not think my way into praying. I prayed my way into thinking.  David P.

Music Research Series presents Rachel McCarthy  | Goldsmiths, University of London;"18 Nov 2021, 6:00pm - 7:30pm 
309, Richard Hoggart Building  “Marxist music studies in the neoliberal academy”  Tension between social justice narratives that emphasise the politics of difference and Marxist economic analysis has become especially heightened in the neoliberal era (Shahrzad Mojab 2015, Jodi Melamed 2011). In humanities scholarship, this is evident in debates that pit Foucauldian discourse analysis against Marxist materialism, or individual subjectivity against social structures. In music studies, this tension comes to the fore in literature that contends that the discipline’s dominant focus on the politics of difference signals complicity with neoliberalism (James Currie 2009, 2012; J. P. E. Harper-Scott 2012, 2020; David Blake 2017). Following a theoretical thread that links the politics of difference to postmodernism and in turn to neoliberalism, Currie characterises the question of identity and difference that consumed the new musicology of the 1990s—and continues to do so today—as ‘a politically flavored distraction that potentially enabled politics in its proper transformative sense not to happen’ (2012, xiii). McCarthy argues that while Currie and Harper-Scott have produced valuable work, their critique of the politics of difference and failure to challenge the social hegemony of whiteness and maleness constitutes a regressive step for Marxist music studies. Developing on this work while critiquing some of its claims, then, her paper challenges the notion of ‘transformative’ political work by exploring the relationships between structure and subjectivity, materialism and discourse, in current music studies. She do this through brief excursions into two case studies.   Music Research Lectures are free and all are welcome.  The Music Research Series invites researchers from across the country, and from within the department, to present and discuss their work.  The Series is a space for the development of cutting-edge research in music, and for the training of postgraduate and Early Career Researchers from Goldsmiths and elsewhere.   The sessions bring together scholars, practitioners, and people working in music outside the university. They may include formal papers, panel discussions, conversations, or any other format that suits the research.  Undergraduates, researchers and visitors from across the college and the community are also most welcome to these public lectures.

This Has Rapidly Become Gen Z’s Top Music Genre - YPulse;"Nov 16 2021  YPulse’s data shows that young consumers are listening to this music genre more than ever, and Gen Z is driving its popularity…   YPulse’s recent music report found that 42% of 13-39-year-olds say COVID-19 and quarantines changed the kind of music they listen to. Headlines have reported that Gen Z is leading the emo and punk revival, and that young fans have continued to contribute to the global explosion of K-pop. But YPulse data shows that young listeners’ music tastes were shifting even before the pandemic.  Our annual music behavioral survey, asks 13-39-year-olds, “Which of the following genres / categories of music do you enjoy listening to?” and monitors the popularity of 28 genres, including pop, alt, country. Tracking their responses through recent years shows the clear decreases in popularity among some genres, and the increase in popularity among one genre in particular:   Pop, rock, and alternative have seen the most notable declines in the number of young people who say they enjoy listening to the genres. Three years ago, pop was a top genre with more than half (62%) of young music listeners saying they enjoy listening to it—and now, it’s at 39% for 13-39-year-olds. Instead another genre has taken its place as young listeners’ favorite: hip hop/rap. The number of young people who say they enjoy listening to hip-hop/rap has increased significantly in the last five years, seeing the most significant spike between 2018 and 2019.. While other genres have faltered during this time, hip hop’s popularity among young listeners only continues to grow. Hip hop artists are also creating major cultural moments for these generations: Draake was named artist of the decade at this year’s Billboard Music Awards and his “Toosie Slide” song (and accompanying dance) quickly became a viral hit on TikTok last year. In September, he released Certified Lover Boy, whose album cover inspired thousands of memes, and quickly rose to the top of the charts. Kanye West’s album Donda, which also came out recently, reportedly broke livestreaming records for Apple when he hosted an event in Atlanta ahead of its debut, and it just hit a billion streams on Spotify and is dominating the Billboard charts. But our data shows that Gen Z is driving the growth in this genre:  The number of Gen Z respondents who say they enjoy listening to hip hop/rap has increased drastically between 2019 and 2021, while remaining steady among Millennials. We see evidence of Gen Z’s hip hop fandom in their favorite music artist ranking as well: Drake, Eminem, and Kanye West are among the well-known rappers to appear on both generations’ rankings,. but Gen Z was most likely to name Drake as their top artist (compared to Millennials who were most likely to say “None”), and also listed more emerging and established hip-hop/rap artists like Cardi, Lil Wayne, Doja Cat, the late Juice Wrld, NBA YoungBoy, and Nicki Minaj higher on their list. 
 Interestingly, the decline in popularity in pop and alternative are actually being driven by Millennials, with the number of this generation who say they enjoy these genres dropping significantly between 2019 and 2021. This makes rap/hip hop this generation’s top genre as well, despite the lack in popularity surge it has seen among Gen Z.  But it should be noted that while specific genres of music are seeing popularity waves and surges, there is another phenomenon at play among young music fans: the blending and bending of genres. Our behavioral data actually found that the majority (79%) of 13-39-year-olds say their music taste doesn’t fall into one specific genre or category, while more than half (54%) say music artists of their generation don’t fit into a specific genre. The late Juice Wrld, whose unique emo-rap style seemed to resonate with Gen Z, some of which have leaned into the emo revival on TikTok, is the perfect example of this. So is Kacey Musgraves, whose last two albums, Golden Hour and Star-Crossed, have been praised for its blending of country and synth pop music. The Grammys actually just announced that her latest album isn’t eligible for Best Country Album at next year’s ceremony because The Recording Academy believed it “didn’t fit into the genre.” Then of course, there’s rapper-turned-punk artist Machine Gun Kelly who only recently got into the pop punk scene after first launching his career in hip-hop/rap in the mid-2000s.  In fact, young artists are increasingly pushing against strict categorization of music genres, and their young fans are clearly behind them. So while the increased popularity of hip hop is absolutely a trend to pay attention to, it’s likely that young consumers don’t want their music taste to be constrained, and want the industry, and brands to embrace genre-bending music and artists.

Invasion of the 'Non-Musicians' | David John Baker;"Noteworthy theme Built with Hugo 
At the end of last week Ted Gioia shared a blog post that reminded him of “the STEM-ification of musicology and how desperately we need more interdisciplinary dialogue about music”.
In the post, Gioia makes the point that people with STEM backgrounds are, to use his word, “encroaching” on music studies.
This inevitable encroachment is made even more harrowing by his chosen key quote which reads:

“STEM researchers have access to much more grant money than any musicologist can even dream of. If scientists want to take over music scholarship, no one will stop them.”

For those who regularly work in the interdisciplinary space, this might sound very familiar as it is something David Huron has also predicted about the future of music studies.
Since writing my first draft of this post, one of the music theory meme pages has also carried a darker form of that energy into this week.
This mostly has come in the form of gate-keeping and degree shaming, two things I thought we were trying to distance ourselves from as music scholars.


As well as making some quite, what I felt to be very rude, comments about some of the empirical literature that the author had the luxury of deleting.

Both the Gioia blog, as well as some of these other tweets, could generously be read to just be calls for more interdisciplinary dialogue (can’t argue with that), but the more I thought about them, the more something just didn’t sit well with me about the encroaching language and the meme page.
And this sentiment clearly resonates with a lot of people who follow these music meme pages, the tweet got many likes.
I’ll engage with Ted’s blog so I can do a bit of thinking out loud regarding what didn’t sit well with me.
I don’t really have time to re-write this to be more tweet-centric, but I think most people will see those connections.

In talking about his own reading in the past 30 years (which, I assume means the majority of his professional career?), the author says that most of what influences him comes from “outside of music academia”.
Fields that have influenced him include:

Neuroscience
Evolutionary Biology
Cognitive Psychology
Mythology
Folklore
Sociology
Anthropology
Cultural History.

Here a presumably clean line is drawn between music and not music.
But is making this demarcation really that simple?
If we assume for a second that maybe it is true and that pure music research can be excised from other disciplines, does it also then follow that only music researchers are equipped to deal with new research that might involve music?
What felt strange in continuing to read this article, thinking about these questions about disciplinary boundaries, was the lurking assumption that scholars with professional training from other fields are somehow ill equipped to be asking the types of questions that they find interesting about music because they don’t have a formal music background.
The examples that are used to illustrate the “splintering of knowledge” are where I am directing my attention when it comes to this.
I’ll quote it at length since there is a lot I want to reference directly.

But the absence of a significant, ongoing dialogue between music scholars and these other disciplines is regrettable. Perhaps neuroscientists, for example, are overreaching and reductionist in their attempts to ‘explain’ music—but no matter what your views on that topic, the efficacy and value of their research will be improved if musicologists engage with them in constructive dialogue. And the same is probably true of many STEM fields that are now ‘encroaching’ on music studies—just wait and see what damage will be wrought by algorithms and artificial intelligence.
Nothing in the music world today will have more impact than these expert systems, created by well-meaning outsiders who will completely change our musical culture, often without actually understanding it.


This trend won’t end any time soon—if only because STEM researchers have access to much more grant money than any musicologist can even dream of. If scientists want to take over music scholarship, no one will stop them. They will even get a blank check and a comfy corner office to help them do their work.

OK.
A lot to think about here.
I’ll comment on a few small things, then hopefully loop back around.
Neuroscience
First is the neuroscience anecdote, noting the possible “overreaching and reductionist” attempts to explain music.
This presumably is attributed to the fact that a neuroscientist might not have received “adequate” formal music training, thus are more likely to over-generalise their results.
This to me feels like a strawman.
Any ‘overreaching’ when it comes to the (neuro)science literature is usually some journalist trying to cajole some scientist into packaging their finding into a punchy headline to fulfill their impact requirements.
Scientists almost pathologically avoid making any substantial claims about what their findings do and do not imply.
It’s interesting that the meme page references two news articles covering the two academic articles and not the actual articles themselves.
And also suggested another blog post that seems to do the same thing (reference a journalist’s version of the article rather than read the author at their words).
You can read that article here.
The thing is, claims of being too ‘reductionist’ when it comes to science more broadly, to me at least, feel like it’s more the critic finding an novel way to show off  how little they know about what is needed to do in order to run a well-designed experiment than providing the searing take down they think it is.
Science is almost by definition reductionist.
The world is very, very complicated and it needs to be made simple if you hope to gain even modicum of understanding of the part you are trying to tack down.
Also, confusing the small world of statistical models with the “real” world is something you learn early on in many science classes.
Even stranger is the belief that introducing someone with a (historical?) musicology background will be able to join a team of neuroscientists, look at their experimental design and statistical analysis, and then tell them a better way interpret their results.
Usually what happens in these types of collaborations is that those without any scientific training will, yes of course, suggest things that might make it more ecologically valid or realistic, but with those changes also always comes the possibility of more confounding.
I have seen it happen where the stimuli used were a bit naive or confounded, but it happens.
If you know exactly how things are going to turn out, you’re not really doing science are you?
You fix it, move on, and learn something.
Sometimes it is very bad and destructive, especially in “universality” literature, but that’s another conversation and not what is being referenced here.
And even though this runs counter to a deeper point I want to make, it is not like the people who want to invest all the time and resources required to run an fMRI experiment are not “musicians”.
Many of these people have had tons of experience actively practicing and making music.
But even if they didn’t, I don’t think that it should preclude people from pursing questions dealing with music and musical behavior.
These arguments smell like what is used to discredit non-traditional forms of music making entering the music conservatory space.
What should preclude you is to go head first into an area and declare that you are starting a new science of music, conveniently not engaging with the decades of scholarship on specific topics that has existed.
If you are going to do interdisciplinary work, you really do have to read a lot.
AI
A similar scenario is put forward in the blog post with the case of AI.
Yes, AI used inappropriately will be bad.
There is already overwhelming evidence about this in many situations.
But again, the issues at the intersection of AI and ethics and music don’t just need any old music humanities person to be pushed on to their team to prevent the havoc.
They need a team of people, all who read about this very new, important, large, very relevant area to discuss these problems.
And to assume that these STEM people need to work with people in music to prevent this damage happening weirdly just lets the STEM people believe that the ethics of developing new technology can just be passed to other people.
They can just focus on “the science”. (ha!)
I guess the point I am trying to make here is that it’s not just about bringing experts together from disparate, enshrined silos of academia to work together.
It’s about acknowledging that what we study changes fast and we all miss out if we draw a line between where one discipline starts and another ends.
It’s about providing the awareness and access way earlier in our training programs so that we don’t trick students into thinking that there are clear boundaries.
The other major issue of one discipline encroaching on another also, again, to me at least, feels like one discipline is coming for another one’s questions.
This is of course a bit more difficult to disentangle because what has been thought of as “music” research and “science” research have historically been more intertwined.
But in a more contemporary sense, music researchers and science researchers are often interested in very different kinds of questions.
They also adopt very different epistomological and ontological assumptions about the subject of their research.
This might be the real issue that generates this rift.
And to assume that there is only one, and that one is traditionally music’s point-of-view, feels like it is committing the exact sin of saying science is being too monolithic.
Or maybe it’s humanities music researcher’s fear that the public will be unquestioning in their reading of any scientific literature.
This is also a real concern, but feels like the enemy here is scienceism, not the literature that has been referenced, is the problem.
It is not as if there is core, finite, and bounded set of “music” questions (and assumed shared epistomological point-of-view) that is still in need of being “discovered” and that by adding Science to it, somehow this makes it better or more efficient (Feyerabend’s Cosmology A, p. 198).
Often I feel that if you take the questions of those who work in music departments and then add Science without thinking critically, this almost inevitably makes the research worse.
It should be also noted that not all musicologist’s questions of interest are even made better with the tools of science.
Having science tacked on to an argument in many ways detracts from the larger point being made.
Then lastly, before I try to summerise things neatly, I also want to return to this idea of if the study of music can be excised out and neatly partitioned.
One of my first thoughts when looking at the list above was actually wondering what this argument would look like if someone said that most of the new and interesting findings about music were actually coming from disciplines outside of music, but then listed areas such as queer, colonial, Indigenous, or gender studies?
Are those subjects not music?
Some cranky old men would probably say so.
It almost feels like there is a shadow version of that blog post that could be written that takes that point of view.
And were we to not allow ideas from gender studies, neuroscience, biology, queer studies, psychology , mythology , Indigenous studies, sociology, anthropology, colonial studies and cultural theory to inform how we think about music, what would be left with?
So what are my major points now that I have thought out loud about this?
The first is STEM people are probably qualified to be asking the questions they want to ask of music.
Yes, having more disciplines contributing to any question would be better, but that feels like it is true of almost any research endeavour.
A lot of the ‘Non-musicians’ are probably actually very well trained in what they do, but that really shouldn’t matter.
If we want to have diverse questions being asked about music, we should not insist that the only people who can ask them are those that share our background.
Second, just because you have traditional music training, it doesn’t follow that you’ll be automatically helpful on other projects.
An advanced degree in music does not guarantee this and you are setting people up for failure if you tell them this.
What is needed is to actually read the articles (not what other people say about them) that have been written and ask questions when you don’t understand.
We should work to provide as much infrastructure as possible to help people pursue the questions they find interesting and expose people to many different methods, questions, and epistomologies as we can during training.
So, yes, maybe the tweet version of this blog is “yeah, more interdisciplinary dialogue!”, but it’s way more interesting than that.
 At the end of last week Ted Gioia shared a blog post that reminded him of “the STEM-ification of musicology and how desperately we need more interdisciplinary dialogue about music”.

Specially commissioned music and stories of a dodo in Japan perpetuate the myth of probably the most famous bird in the world. A research paper by artist and Museum fossil bird specialist Julian Pender Hume and a new experimental composition for the harpsichord by Tim Watts have raised the status of the already legendary dodo. Endemic to Mauritius and extinct for around 350 years, the giant flightless pigeon continues to capture people's imagination, partly because it was wiped out by human carelessness. Dr Hume, who recently contributed to the re-imaging of the dodo in Sir David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive film, studied the seventeenth century journals of the commander of a Dutch factory in Deshima, an island off Nagasaki, Japan.  The journals suggest that, not only was a live dodo transported to Japan from Mauritius by boat, but also that the birds were still surviving on Mauritius in 1647, a few years after scientists estimate the species went extinct. Part of the reason no one knows exactly what the dodo, Raphus cucullatus, looked like is because only a few of them were ever exported to Europe, possibly as few as two, one of which lived at the back of a shop in London.  The Dutch settled on Mauritius in 1598 and used it as a refreshment station for ships en route to east Asia. Deshima was particularly important because the Dutch were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan, but could only do so through the island. Dr Hume now suggests that a dodo and a white deer were sent by the Dutch to Deshima in 1647 as rare gifts for the governor of the island or one of his superiors, to maintain good trading relations. But the mystery of the dodo continues. While the destination of its travelling companion, the white deer, was recorded, the fate of the dodo upon arrival in Deshima is unknown. ‘Unless documentary evidence survives that records it presence in Japan, the fate of the last recorded captive dodo will never be known,' said Dr Hume. 'That live dodos survived the arduous and lengthy voyages both east and west, however, is certainly testament to their endurance and adaptability.' Within a century of the Dutch settlement on Mauritius, the dodo had been wiped out due to the decimation of the ebony forests and the introduction of non-native animals such as rats and monkeys that preyed on the bird and its eggs. Sailors also ate dodo meat. In a collaboration between the Royal College of Music and the Centre for Arts and Humanities Research at the Museum, Tim Watts chose the dodo skeleton housed at the Museum to inspire his new classical composition for the harpsichord, Dodo Suite.  'Despite being a composite, the dodo skeleton seems full of personality, as if it is trying urgently to communicate through the glass that now confines it,' Watts said.   'My Dodo Suite seeks to animate this sense of personality, through allusions to the dance forms and contrapuntal style of the time of the dodo's discovery. The harpsichord, which not so long ago also came quite close to extinction, inhabits an ""imaginary space"", created using sounds recorded in different parts of the Museum, as well as ""replicas"" of harpsichord sonorities created with plucked piano strings.' Dodo Suite is part of an ongoing project exploring the potential of using natural history specimens to inspire classical music. It premiered on Monday as part of the Cambridge Science Festival, in partnership with St John's College, Cambridge. Because dodos are so rare, the specimen on display at the Museum is a composite made up from bones from different animals. New research suggests the dodo was leaner and more upright than traditionally portrayed.

The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads - Cognition Today;"Cognition Today

 Home » Social Psychology » The Social Psychology Of Heavy Metal & Rock Music: Research On Metalheads Picture this: A bunch of unique-looking headbanging people listening to heavy music; entering a whirlpool of human collision in front of their favorite artist; raising their fists in the air; raising the devil’s horns \m/. What is that all about? Who are they? These are the metalheads. What is their psychology?  We are going to look at the social psychology of heavy metal and rock music fans. In this article, I’ll review the scientific research done on their personality, their behavior, why they do what they do, what they get out it, etc. The effects of heavy metal music can be described through a social-music psychology lens. Let’s look through it.  Heavy metal has many connotations that relate to social psychology. I’ll highlight the most prominent ones here. These come from the heavy metal audience – the musicians as well as the fans.  Brotherhood, Rebellion, Honest Expression, Repression, Outsider, Anger and Aggression, Brutality, Conformity and Non-conformity, Isolation, Depression, Oneness, Homogeneity, Dissolving in the crowd, Respect and Victory, Sincerity and Discipline, Dramatization, and Authority.  These connotations signify something. Heavy metal music caters to some very fundamental feelings and experiences humans have in society. I’ve left out many more connotations that don’t help this post but feel free to take a moment and think. Some of them may contradict each other and that is because heavy metal has many different sub-genres (death metal, thrash metal, power metal, doom metal, etc.) which cater to certain aspects of human experiences.  Positive behavioral outcomes occur when the audience is a fan of metal music. Let’s find out what they are. Just like most other forms of music, people synchronize with each other. Heavy metal relates people to one another and gives existential meaning to many.  Even though people have considered rock music as the devil’s music and opined that this form of music creates negative outcomes like aggression, the story is not that simple. A longitudinal study shows that people who grew up in the 80s and 90s with metal as the popular culture lead healthy and fulfilling lives today. In fact, the research report says that they are better adjusted than non-fans and their metalhead identity serves as a protective barrier against negative life experiences. They also say that participation in fringe cultures can enhance identity development in troubled youth.  While there is a known analogy between bipolar disorders (alternating depression & mania) and heavy metal, there is no known cause-effect between the two. Songs might just reflect the human condition of bipolarity without a direct cause-effect relationship.  Researchers have found that people who are angry and aggressive can experience more positive emotions because of the increased arousal from metal music which matches the person’s physiological state. This congruence between anger/aggression and arousal from metal helps with anger regulation. The popular notion that heavy music makes one angry is not substantiated. In fact, listening to heavy metal may be a healthy way of processing anger.  Go headbang to Megadeth if you want to process anger constructively.  When we look at the stress-reducing capacity of music (as a coping mechanism), for non-fans, classical music and self-chosen music works better than a prescription of heavy metal.  A thesis based on case studies shows that listening to music (heavy metal included) helps people who have been traumatized. It helps them regulate their emotions, overcome suicidal thoughts, and occupy their sensory environment. Extreme forms of music give people a sense of relatability and shared communal support (death metal, doom metal) if they are predisposed to negative outcomes. For example, if someone is already experiencing harsh realities (survival issues, self-harm, abuse) the underlying themes in extreme metal which resonate with those realities provide a sense of relief.  Wait… So far, it looks like metal music is a bed of roses, but it might just be a bed of razors. Research on metal music has one deadly finding to showcase.  Metal music can induce serious amounts of negative emotions and predatory instincts in mice while solving a maze. Mice listening to hard rock music ended up killing each other. While mice who listened to Mozart did not kill each other. Mice who listened to heavier music also took more time solving the maze than mice who listen to classical or no music. The auditory stress of rock music might have pushed the mice into a frenzy. Read about it here: Educational CyberPlayGround.  Humans have an ethics-based guiding system in the brain which makes sure that the strong negative emotional states evoked by metal do not translate into such aggressive behavior as that in mice; at least in well-adjusted humans. Severe personality, mood, and psychotic disorders change the picture completely, and the reactions may not be favorable. It is possible that complex metal music cannot be properly processed by mice and is interpreted as a stressor & a threat.  On similar lines, one study by a road-safety authority found that listening to Slipknot’s (sic) can be detrimental to driving. They explain this as an effect of compromised attention.  I did speak of metal music as a way to combat negative emotions and cope with them, even reduce aggressive tendencies. However, this effect appears to be more in fans than in non-fans. Those who don’t prefer high-intensity metal music have an increase in uneasiness after listening but fans appear to have an increase in positive emotions after listening.  This begs the question – How do other music genres fare in emotion regulation? Emotion regulation is about managing and modifying emotions fruitfully. One paper addressed this question. They found that rock music and heavy metal music is potent for managing negative moods. Jazz, Blues, Classical, Rap, Hip-Hop, Soul, Funk, and Electronic/Dance are potent in both negative and positive mood regulation. While the genre classification is crude in this study, they analyzed broad dimensions of music. They provide evidence for rhythm and energy being the two critical factors in regulating emotions.  A study on the link between mental health and metal fans from France shows that the baseline rates of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicide) are similar to those of the general population; sometimes, even lower. One explanation for this is the power of emotional regulation via metal and the sense of community that comes with the fandom. This is in direct contradiction with the general perception that metalheads are more mentally unstable.  Metal and rock music is diverse with many sub-cultures which have certain characteristics, these characteristics may play a role in explaining some observations of deteriorating mental health. For example, a study found evidence that teens who are heavily associated with a goth sub-culture are at a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Although the link was present, the study doesn’t dish out whether at-risk teens prefer a goth sub-culture or the goth-culture normalizes this behavior. Fun fact: An interesting physics-chemistry-music cross-over study showed that people in a mosh-pit behave like molecules of a gas. Where the act of bumping into one other in a pseudo-random way resembles the mathematical structure of the molecules in a gas. You can read about its implications here: Mosh pit physics could aid disaster planning.  Because the audience is small and the person who likes metal does so at a very personal level, you’ll see that a huge number of metal fans are musicians themselves. Apart from the sound of ‘metal’ being an acquired taste for many, being a musician further bolsters the connotations I mentioned at the start of this post.  A survey-based research study on 414 British undergraduates showed that those who liked metal music tended to be more open to experiences, wanted to be unique, and were not in favor of authority. While this isn’t groundbreaking research, it corroborates people’s narratives about why they like metal.  You might be surprised by how metal music relates to romantic relationships. If your significant other sports a Judas Priest teeshirt, chances are he/she is not going to cheat on you as much as someone sporting jazz music teeshirts. A survey study showed that metalheads were least likely to cheat on their partner and jazz fans were most likely to cheat. Turns out, metalheads are loyal and faithful people. As per musical preferences and lifestyle preferences analyzed in this paper, rock music (not metal, data lacking) fans tend to have fewer sexual partners than fans of dance, house, hip-hop, rap, jazz, and indie music. A whopping 93.5% of metalheads had lesser than 5 sexual partners over a 5-year span.  But doesn’t this romantic faithfulness contradict the very essence of a lot of metal music? After all, metal music has the connotations of defiance, rebellion, and a dislike toward law and authority. Cheating is defined as breaking mutually accepted rules. So it looks like metalheads don’t see romance in a social context that has a governing system that dictates rules. One could speculate that romance/love, for metalheads, is deeply personal and asocial. The mutual rules in romance depend only on the partner(s).  There is this lingering question that many have in mind- Do violent & angry themes in music make a person violent? A study explored this question by testing positive & negative emotions and awareness of violent themes on their mental processing of music. They found that violent music does partially desensitize a person depending on how much they like the music. Non-fans showed an increased negativity bias – selective processing of negative information. This shows that non-fans did amplify the processing of violent themes. Fans did not have this bias in spite of being aware of the violent themes. This is probably due to a) Liking the music, b) Long-term exposure, and c) Evaluating the musical experience as positive.  Heavy metal music is intricate. It is based on the acquisition of skills that take a long time to get refined. It’s a genre that clearly evolved from simple to complex musical structures; mostly bound by guitars, vocals, drums, keyboards, and bass. That is just the nature of natural selection applied to music. When a metal musician makes music, it is the result of years of practice. That entails the discipline of studying, focusing on complicated sounds, sweating, and creating something new. Simply because the musician is involved in such mental and physical activity which costs a lot and often does not yield much monetarily, the musician attaches feelings of ‘sacrifice’ to it. This increases the sense of accomplishment felt by the musician.  I can only imagine that such a routine makes hard-working, sincere, and creative people who are proud of their struggle to make something interesting with music. One important factor is the feedback loop between music and the self. Making structured music will start making the musician structure other things in life. A showy guitarist will most likely be flashy in other parts of his or her life. A person who generally listens to a variety of things would be open-minded in other factors. Whereas an extremely fussy musician will also tend to be fussy about the food he/she eats. These are some likely examples, they are not generalizations.  Metal musicians often make music with other musicians. This is a form of ‘coupling’ or synchronized behavior. Songs sound like songs because of this inherent quality of coupling. Random sounds do not sound like music because they lack coupling. In fact, this coupling is popularly understood as the chemistry between musicians. A study showed how the brains of guitarists who are playing together synchronize their brain waves before the music begins, thereby supporting the idea of this intuitive coupling. Read about it here. When coupled, fans and musicians experience similar emotional states which foster bonding through dedicated systems. These dedicated systems are interesting meta-networks of neurons that fire in a way that mirrors (for lack of a better word) someone else’s behavioral, cognitive, and emotional state. They are associated with observation, mimicking, synchronizing, and understanding different perspectives. They also foster nurturing and companionship which is required for pair-bonding. This musical coupling is likely to make a person more sensitive and empathetic. I’m not talking about mirror neurons, I’m talking about a dozen other networks which explain similar functions in humans.  One research study suggests that the metal ‘gig’ ritual (headbanging included) allows musicians to go in a state of flow. The very act of playing along with a band on stage made a musician more likely to experience flow. Taking a step backward, flow is the mental state where one is completely absorbed in a task and feels one with it. Flow is a positive desirable state because it is connoted by task engagement, a deep connection with the task, intrinsic satisfaction, challenge, and joy.  The curiously interesting bit is that the musicians experience flow in spite of the deeply embedded negative emotional states like anger, frustration, and rebellion in metal music. You can read more about the flow state and how to achieve it here. There certainly are pros and cons observed in heavy metal music-making and listening. And that’s hardly a problem – career difficulties, community building, in-group & out-group aggression, etc. are a part of many sects. You look at any sub-section of society – there will be extreme outliers, quirks, pros, and cons. That’s a discussion more suited to the human condition on the whole than on any form of music.  General life stories of heavy metal fans show:1. Significant emotional depth is added to like-mindedness in music2. There is a phase in their lives where metal music added meaning to their ‘not so pleasant lives.’ 3. Metal becomes an integral part of their lives and the related attitudes and behavior are seen across many facets of their lives including relationships, school, parenthood, etc. These are the reasons metalheads get obsessive about their music as well. Which, sometimes, is unhealthy as they could become dogmatic and disrespectful toward music which isn’t their own.  Although this isn’t a tested hypothesis, I would say that metal music makes people behave in a collective way largely because it is a minority. This is similar to a phenomenon in evolutionary biology called negative frequency-dependent selection. In simple terms, the value of heavy metal is high because of its relatively low frequency in the whole population. That is, heavy metal fans are a minority and heavy metal music is more valuable because it is rare as opposed to pop music – which is, by definition, popular and abundant.  People may slightly overestimate its effects and be biased due to the music being relatively rare. It’s like seeing a person you know in a foreign country, you end up evaluating that person in a more favorable way. Metal music itself is democratic within this minority, fans become musicians and vice-versa. They maintain the genre & subculture by assuming at least one of the two roles. That is why you can say that heavy metal is of the people, by the same people, and for the same people. For those about to rock, we salute you! There is one last thing I’d like to introduce. When you look at a lot of sub-genres of music, the various emotions associated with each sub-genre, and the musical complexity, there is an overarching theme that emerges. This theme is about how metal music evolves alongside people, culture, science, art, technology, and the environment.  The theme has multiple feedback loops & transfer effects – thinking about science could be informed by musical complexity, socio-cultural nuances of metal could inform technological advancement, metal could foster newer public sentiments such as concern for climate change, etc. You can read this paper to know more about the holistic bird’s eye view of how metal music interacts with the human condition.  \m/  Hey!

 Great article Aditya, I really enjoyed reading it. The themes in your paper cover something that I have been thinking about for a while (I have an Art Therapy background and work with children with emotional and behavioural problems) about the psycho-emotional aspects to listening to metal and anger/emotion regulation. I have always dreamed of doing a Quantitative study on it amongst friends hah! Your section on flow catches what my own experiences are with listening to metal music, particularly with lyrics that tap into a certain emotionally charged memory (I’m a massive TOOL fan, as well as Deftones, Mastodon and Messhugah XD). Personally I would definitely support the thesis that listening to music with negative-emotion themes helps process and deal with difficult experiences. Catharsis, similar to the Art Therapy process of pouring and mess-making is very present in Metal music to me.
Again I would say the concept of flow as either an active player or listener at a gig/in-headphones was at times a spiritual experience, like BHarath is saying above, and I think of it as being taken out of your mind and body by the sound and having a feeling of great release at those moments, when certain riffs or lyrical content hits the right nerve. Anyway, great article, thank you very much for posting! Hey Alistair, thank you so much for appreciating my article and sharing your experience! I’m delighted to hear you also think negatively charged themes can help with regulation! Regarding the parallel between mess-making and so-called “noise-making” actually has so much value. Probably not just in regulation & catharsis, but also in creative exploration and accidental discoveries. Certainly, feeling “flow” while listening and/or playing is quite powerful. I personally enjoy listening flow more than playing flow, particularly when I am in an exploratory zone. That complete engagement of your senses when all else drowns out is amazing. Its a Gate way to spirituality (Don’t mistake it for religious) – Spirituality in understanding the oneself (U) so that you could understand everything else.
The Stigma of Metal being Evil or the Devils Music is bullshit – In India Its hard to find one True Metal head (Fan or performer) – Who has the complete understanding of the above and who ha the richness with humility kind of notion. I have literally not met one – and i doubt i would find any; In India, these so called metal heads are either – fools or stupid enough to think they are the best – because of the weird look, (In a way, attraction) a wasted talent, which is called Music; never used with a purpose rather used to show off. Stupid competition of feeling great by stamping an innocent or week. Feeling special for smoking up. Lol.
WHo has no respect for his own culture but curiously and clueless running behind a culture with ZERO wisdom  I have not found one solid Metal head in India. All are so fake – that they can say; they have never heard Bollywood music, MC** are you serious – how much would anyone fake. Just a trying copy of the one already existing.  DOn’t respond to this if you want to prove coz you will never succeed, As an Example – The Indian Heavy Metal Music itself is your answer. It has always been a copy and never authentic … A*** Holes all of them ..  DO you know something – A Character like Bhagath, Bismil, Azad, I am sure if they knew heavy metal existed – They would have been the one.

Hey, thank you so much for thinking about donation, really appreciate your sentiment:) I do have a donate button in the footer section! I’m a 40-year-old Heavy Metal musician and this article basically explains everything that has been going on in my mind since I was 13. If I had to comment on every point and expand it, I could write a book, so I’ll stick to one issue: The apparent contradiction with romantic faithfulness and rebellion. I have always been faithful in relationships, and a rebel all my life. Here’s why: 1. Faithfulness is not about obedience, but loyalty. And while we hate obeying rules, we love loyalty. It’s actually rewarded in the culture (at least it was in my country Malta’s, metal scene)
2. Being a “Metal couple” is in itself an act of rebellion. Though nowadays I’m much more into the music than the fashion, I remember being young and feeling proud that my girlfriend wore studs and Type O Negative t-shirts.
3. The passion for metal, makes the relationship stronger. When I had non-metal girlfriends there were times we ended up talking about the weather. With metal girlfriends, we only talked about the weather if a storm was coming and there was an open-air gig. When you’re young, and you don’t have kids, the passion for metal could be near as bonding as bringing up a child. Thanks for commenting Robert:D The 3 reasons you gave – spot on! Loyalty is a very different concept for us and is completely different from rebellion. I see it rewarded in the Indian metal scene too. I am not really in the scene anymore but can confirm point 2 and 3 anecdotally.  The passion gave me a new way of life after a dull and boring school life!";https://cognitiontoday.com/the-social-psychology-of-heavy-metal-rock-music-research-on-metalheads;
The Steve Brooks Archives:  Willie Nelson And Cultural Changes In Country Music | Music Library Blog;"By the early 1960s, the Country Music Association decided to shed its negative “hillbilly” image and market country music to a sophisticated blue-collared audience (Pecknold 2007, 135). This initiative caused a cultural shift in the genre aimed at promoting a clean-cut image. By the early 1970s, however, a subculture emerged that opposed this polished and commercialized Nashville sound (Cobb 1982, 87). This style of country music went by the prefix “outlaw” in reference to song themes based on criminal activities such as lying, stealing, cheating, and substance abuse. Among the leaders to spearhead this movement were songwriters Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Willie Nelson, to name just a few. During this era, Willie Nelson’s image underwent a drastic change starting with the release of his first “outlaw” album, Shotgun Willie (1973). As his fame skyrocketed, Nelson became known for his outlaw compilation albums and annual music festivals, including the ongoing summer concert, Willie’s Fourth of July Picnic. During these years, Willie Nelson hired Steve Brooks as his primary artist for promotional works. The Steve Brooks collection housed at the UNT Special Collections archives provides a glimpse into an extraordinary historical moment in country music. This collection offers a unique perspective on how one outlaw country artist both drew from and resisted country music tropes.   The basis for my archival project was to explore the artwork done by UNT alum Steve Brooks. This collection contains a broad assortment of art ranging from sketches, handbills, posters, t-shirts, and a few miscellaneous items like plastic cups, matchbooks, and an odd-looking cardboard shoe. While I consulted a diverse selection from Brook’s other clients, I focused specifically on his Willie Nelson art. I wondered what these archives could tell us about the state of country music at the specific historical moment in which Brooks worked. Who was the intended audience? By trying to understand the purpose of these artifacts, I hoped to glean a few possible motivations that guided their creation. Over the last several weeks, I searched through the Steve Brooks collection to see whether I could detect reoccurring themes with the hope that I might start a conversation about their historical relevance.      The first box I opened from the archives contained approximately fifty manila folders, roughly 12 x 10 inches in size, with sketches that ranged from the early 1970s to the early 1980s. Based on the drawings from this box, which were consistent throughout this collection, Brooks could best be classified as a cartoonist with a few pieces that resembled realistic portraits. The first folder had a Willie Nelson caricature holding his famous nylon-stringed guitar wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and tennis shoes, as seen in figure 1.   Figure 1. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 5, Folder 1, “Cowboy Willie,” Sketch, undated. He sported a thick bushy beard, long shaggy hair, beady eyes, and a wide, friendly grin. Next to his name read “Cowboy Willie” in a cursive font designed to look like a cactus. A few folders later, another Nelson cartoon appeared (figure 2) with a similarly bearded smile, but with the addition of a headband holding back his braided hair. Figure 2. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 5, Folder 4, “Rope Letter, Willie with Character,” undated. The “Willie” logo in this picture was written with a lasso and presumably two Texas stars to dot the lowercase I’s. The first themes I noticed appeared to be based on wild west cowboy tropes such as lassos, cactuses, cow skulls, and boot spurs.  While these associations with country music were somewhat common, there were apparent differences that clashed with previous generations’ straight-laced style worn by Buck Owens, Hank Williams, Bob Wills, and even Willie Nelson himself. Figure 3. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 5, Folder 37, “Willie for ’75,” 1975. By the 1970s, Nelson’s identity had more in common with the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. The outlaw country version that Brooks captured in his caricatures emphasized Nelson’s rejection of clean-cut country values (figure 3). His long braided, scruffy beard, worn-out t-shirts, jeans, and tennis shoes contrasted starkly with the crewcut, freshly shaven, collared-shirt cowboy image he had formerly sported. His carefree facial expressions were another feature that struck me as thematic. Indeed, early country music stars almost always smiled. It occurred to me that Willie Nelson’s smile in the Brooks caricatures might be drug-induced (see figure 4). Figure 4. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 7, Folder 13, “Premium Willie Music in Wichita Falls, Texas – Sketch Studies,” 9-15-1978. By the 1970s, Nelson made his affection for drugs, especially marijuana, well known to his fans—a reputation he still carries today (Patoski, 2008). It is plausible that Brooks emphasized this side of Nelson’s personality to appeal to his outlaw country audience. Even his choice to use cartoons undercuts the sophisticated image that mainstream country aimed to instill. Aside from one or two still-life drawings—among the select few where Nelson is not smiling—cartoons dominated this collection, like in figure 5. Figure 5. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 5, Folder 113, “Air Willie – Sketch,” 1981-1982. For comparison purposes, I consulted a few boxes with flyers for Brooks’ other high-profile clients including the Allman Brothers, the Beach Boys, Elton John, Alice Cooper, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, and the Eagles. From these samples, I was surprised that none of them had cartoon depictions of the musicians. Some had only band logos with a photograph, while others contained a few life-like drawings similar to those from the Willie Nelson collection (figures 6-8).  Figure 6. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 2, Folder 41, “Jethro Tull – Dallas Memorial Arboretum,” 6-18-1972. Figure 7. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 2, Folder 46, “Pink Floyd – SMU McFarlin Auditorium,” 9-10-1972. Figure 8. Steve Brooks Collection, Box 5, Folder 12, “Willie Nelson and Family Sportatorium,” 1-15-1980 The date on the outside of the folders showed that these pieces originated from 1972 to 1975, the same time period when Brooks worked with Willie Nelson. This detail reaffirmed my suspicion that the Willie Nelson art expressed cultural values and ideologies meant for a specific audience.  After learning about country music’s history in conjunction with events from Willie Nelson’s life, I began to see Brooks’ art in a new light. My goal was never to discover a missing piece of popular music history; rather, I wanted to provide some insight into how country music’s cultural values started to change in the 1970s. More importantly, I wanted to learn how Steve Brooks reflected these changes with art that would still resonate with Willie Nelson fans as they gather for his annual Fourth of July Picnic each year. While working with the Steve Brooks archives, I was unable to glean how much artistic freedom he had for these commissions. However, the sheer size of this collection convinced me that his clients must have felt he had an innate gift for accurately capturing their musical identity with his drawings.

Listening to music with meaning may help ease Alzheimer’s disease | BBC Science Focus Magazine;Putting on their favourite playlist may help kickstart the brains of patients with dementia. Whether it’s a dance floor banger or a more intimate slow jam, everyone has their go-to tune that they listen to to bring back fond memories. Now, researchers at the University of Toronto have found that listening to these nostalgic tunes can help to boost the brain function in patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer’s disease. The finding opens the door for music-based interventions for people with dementia, the researchers say. “We have new brain-based evidence that autobiographically salient music – that is, music that holds special meaning for a person, like the song they danced to at their wedding – stimulates neural connectivity in ways that help maintain higher levels of functioning,” said Prof Michael Thaut, senior author of the study, director of U of T’s Music and Health Science Research Collaboratory. “Typically, it’s very difficult to show positive brain changes in Alzheimer’s patients. These preliminary yet encouraging results show improvement in the integrity of the brain, opening the door to further research on therapeutic applications of music for people with dementia – musicians and non-musicians alike.” Read more about music: In a small study of 14 that included eight musicians and four non-musicians, the team played a curated playlist of chosen tunes to participants for one hour a day for three weeks and along with random tunes that had no personal meaning. They then used functional MRI scanning before and after the listening period to determine changes to brain function and structure – particularly in the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s control centre where deep cognitive processes occur. “Music-based interventions may be a feasible, cost-effective and readily accessible intervention for those in early-stage cognitive decline,” said Corinne Fischer, lead author, associate professor in the department of psychiatry in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine. “Existing treatments for Alzheimer’s disease have shown limited benefit to date. While larger controlled studies are required to confirm clinical benefits, our findings show that an individualised and home-based approach to music-listening may be beneficial and have lasting effects on the brain.” With new music, the particpants' brain activity was largely confined to the auditory cortex. But with long-known music the activity fired in the prefrontal cortex – a sign of cognitive engagement. There was also a subtle difference in the brains of those that played instruments and those that didn’t. “Whether you’re a lifelong musician or have never even played an instrument, music is an access key to your memory, your pre-frontal cortex,” said Thaut. “It’s simple: keep listening to the music that you’ve loved all your life. Your all-time favourite songs, those pieces that are especially meaningful to you. Make that your brain gym.” Jason is the commissioning editor for BBC Science Focus.

Post-Euphoria – A Reincarnated Ruin: Part 2 | norient.com;"In part 2 of Guy Baron’s Norient series on his practice-based music research project Post-Euphoria, he thinks about compositional strategies to interpret themes of recollection and reimagination. In the two recordings titled «Too Late» and «Residue», I utilize audio-to-MIDI conversions as a compositional strategy and to foreground sonic transformations that interpret themes of recollection and reimagination explored in my album Post-Euphoria. «Too Late» was conceived through editing and manipulating a four-bar audio sample containing a piano chord progression typical of house music productions. Importing the sample to Ableton Live, I used the software’s audio-to-MIDI conversion tool – a feature that enables the user to reproduce an audio recording in MIDI (a format that digitally stores notation and rhythmic information) – and assigned a virtual synthesizer to the newly converted clip, creating re-arranged versions of the original sample. I also slowed down the converted sample and created different transpositions of it, while applying audio effects like chorus, phaser, equalizer, and reverb automations to examine how it can be sonically expanded. Further incorporated is a sung phrase based on the lead vocal line from Carol King’s «It’s Too Late» (King and Stern, 1971), which I re-recorded using my own voice as a short, duplicated fragment. I then created an additional, complementing recording titled «Residue», in which the converted MIDI clip is once again rearranged and sounded through another sample. 
 Malleability of Sound Employing these production strategies enabled me to playfully reimagine elements of electronic dance music and to explore new meanings and associations that emerge through their reconstruction and decontextualization. In particular, the audio-to-MIDI conversion made me think of drawing a connection between the malleability of sound and the shifting mental image of recollected euphoric experiences. As the original audio sample is being converted to MIDI, it inevitably transforms and becomes mutated, with some musical information being lost due to failures in the digital conversion process. The misconfiguration of the audio sample was in this way emphasized to present a mutated and reincarnated ruin of the original sample. The conversion also served as a useful compositional and arrangement tool, with which I was able to create different musical sections, distinct in timbre and pitch, based on a single loop. A Hazy Sentiment The vocal line, which fragments a lyrical and melodic phrase from a previous song, can be seen as further embodying the idea of a fragmented ruin – mediated and transformed through my own singing body, which operates as a sampler-like device. As the lyrics suggest a sense of belatedness yet remain sparse and ambiguous throughout, the idea of a late and faded reincarnation is further implied, feeding into my understanding of post-euphoria as a subjectivity that entails fleetingness and retrospection. And as the once-pulsing samples of electronic dance music motifs are being reconstructed and abstracted, a hazy and reflective sentiment takes the place of dancefloor euphoria. 
 The audio-turned-MIDI sample is being further alienated in «Residue», as it is sounded through another sample. What emerges from conducting such a resampling process can be figuratively described as a memory of a memory, as the original sample is being reimagined twice. This idea is reinforced by presenting the two recordings as part of an integrated concept album, suggesting a sense of intertextuality with which memories of past euphoric experiences and their transformation over time can be portrayed musically. This article is the second of a four-part series on the practice-based music research project «Post-Euphoria» by Guy Baron aka Semi Precious. Published on October 29, 2021 Last updated on January 27, 2022 From machine-assisted musicking to the struggle of creating under precarious circumstances and in a world in which work rules everything. Why does a Kenyan producer of the instrumental style EDM add vocals to his tracks? This topic is about HOW things are done, not WHAT. From the music format «78 rpm», the melancholic echoes of a dubbed out rave night in London, and parodic mockings of «perfect house wifes» by female Nigerian pop musicians. In the third part of the series Post-Euphoria, Guy Baron reflects on his use of audio effects to suggest the faded recollection of lost euphoric experiences. In «Forget U», I used my voice to re-record a vocal line from Zara Larsson and MNEK’s single «Never Forget You» (2015). I attempted to examine how the act of quoting such a song, with its dance pop sensibilities, can suggest the re-evocation of blissful moments. I digitally edited the re-recorded five-word phrase («I will never forget you»), creating an additional, reconfigured phrase («I will forget you»). I further embedded these vocal elements in an instrumental arrangement that references electronic dance music production – specifically, build-up sections conventionally aimed at inducing euphoric states amongst dancing crowds (Solberg 2014) – yet without including a kick drum. In the complementary recording «Reprise», I processed an excerpt from «Forget U» using a grain delay effect plug-in that samples and adds delay between fragments of audio material (Sasso 2012).  A Memory that Never Fades? Larsson and MNEK’s song initially caught my attention in the midst of a relationship breakup. It struck me with its determined statement about a memory that seemingly never fades. By isolating and duplicating the phrase, I sought to emphasise this message – but also to point out its peculiarity. Through recreating and digitally editing variations of the original phrase, I was also interested in elaborating its meaning and presenting a more ambivalent reality: as the word «never» is digitally cut out to form the phrase «I will forget you», the meaning of the sentence is inverted, suggesting a thin line between the remembering and the forgetting of once-blissful experiences. The instrumental arrangement of «Forget U» further embodies notions of faded recollection. Recreating stripped-down motifs from electronic dance music, I sought to convey muted and missing dancefloor euphoria – underlined by the lack of elements deemed fundamental to electronic dance music productions, such as a four-on-the-floor kick drum. In addition – and unlike electronic dance music productions, where the build-up usually progresses to a bass-heavy drop section – here the arrangement remains suspended and unresolved throughout. What emerges from this arrangement strategy is a musical aesthetic that dwells on absence and unfulfillment, suggesting partial and transformed memories of recollected euphoric moments. 
 A Fleeting Flashback As the musical matter of «Forget U» undergoes radical processing and transformation in «Reprise», it is presented as fluid and malleable and just about recognisable. Brief and structureless, the latter recording suggests a fleeting flashback to a bygone experience. The fragmentation of sonic grains, as induced by the application of grain delay, figuratively suggests how memories of yearned-for experiences may shift and become fragmented over time. These meanings are further conveyed through placing the recordings alongside one another as part of an integrated body of work, presenting «Reprise» as a faded afterthought of «Forget U».

This article is the third of a four-part series on the practice-based music research project «Post-Euphoria» by Guy Baron aka Semi Precious. Published on November 16, 2021 Last updated on November 22, 2021 Why does a Kenyan producer of the instrumental style EDM add vocals to his tracks? This topic is about HOW things are done, not WHAT. How does the artits’ relationship to the gear affect music? How to make the climate change audible? From the music format «78 rpm», the melancholic echoes of a dubbed out rave night in London, and parodic mockings of «perfect house wifes» by female Nigerian pop musicians. In a four-part series, Guy Baron reflects upon the making of his album Post-Euphoria. Utilizing practice-based research, he examines notions of nostalgia in relation to lost experiences and club music. DAW-based strategies of electronic music production used to connote aspects of recollection and missing are at the heart of my practice-based research. Engaging in a range of electronic music-making practices, my research creatively responds to the concept of «post-euphoria» – conceived here to describe a subjectivity with which lost, yearned-for experiences relating to electronic dance music are recollected and reimagined. It presents an original body of musical work that expressively interprets post-euphoria as a musical aesthetic, using Ableton Live and incorporating electronic dance music-inspired motifs alongside elements of songwriting. The study thus explores ways in which nuanced and complex meanings relating to retrospection and reminiscing can be articulated musically, establishing a musical vocabulary that is concerned with the residual and the faded and with what remains once perceived blissful experiences subside. Conducting the creative work, I developed music production strategies informed by discussions of production mediations (Brøvig-Hanssen and Danielsen 2016) and sonic metaphors (Demers 2010), whilst symbolically foregrounding DAW-induced production traits. This includes creating what I define as «production embodiments» to figuratively suggest aspects of recollection and transformation: from slowing-down and time-warping electronic dance music samples («22–122») and utilizing a sustained freeze-mode reverb («Epilogue») to connote an attempted prolonging of fleeting euphoric moments, to incorporating fragmented quoted vocals («Forget U»), grain delay («Reprise») and audio-to-MIDI conversions («Too Late», «Residue») to metaphorically suggest a fragmented and transformed memory of perceived euphoric experiences. Musical repetition, shortened compositional structures, elaborated outro sections, and volume fade-outs are further utilized to figuratively embody haunting and decaying euphoric experiences, in such a way that sheds light on the relationship between musical form and meaning. 
 Unfulfilled Euphoria In addition to using such production embodiments, I further employ characteristic elements of electronic dance music to examine how euphoric feelings associated with this type of music can be presented as mutated and missing. These elements, to which I refer as electronic dance music tropes, include intensifying build-up sections (Solberg 2014), which are presented throughout the body of work as stripped down and never-resolving – establishing a sense of unfulfilled euphoria by foregrounding the absence of key electronic dance music elements, such as a kick drum. In addition, I create reworks of my own musical recordings as an act of «self-remixing», reflecting intertextuality between different recordings and a revisiting of my own productions to musically portray the idea of transformed recollections. Undertaking this research and developing the recorded body of work enabled me to examine how retrospective subjectivities relating to electronic dance music can be articulated through employing music production technology, to further the relatively sparse practice-based research in this field. In addition, and as a global pandemic made dancefloor euphoria seem like a distant memory, my concept of post-euphoria received a whole new layer of meaning to include reminiscing to a time and place in one’s life – and in our collective memory – that may never quite be what it once was. Enchanted by lost nights out and lingering on remnants of a faded euphoria, this is where my musical journey into the realm of post-euphoria begins.

The series is aimed at postgraduate students and staff but undergraduates and external visitors are welcome at every talk. Each session will include a virtual presentation by an invited speaker followed by questions and discussion. For some events, materials may be shared ahead of time with links on this page. The series is open to all staff and students of the University of Sheffield as well as external visitors. Staff and PG students should enter via Blackboard>MUS Postgraduate Hub>Collaborate>Research Seminar Room. UGs and external visitors should email to request the link to admin-pgrmusic@sheffield.ac.uk. The mental health benefits of group singing activities have increasingly featured in many research projects and in the media. However, the focus is generally on the benefits for the singers rather than upon the challenges of facilitating singing groups with an emphasis on mental wellbeing. In this context, the demands upon facilitators are wide-ranging, requiring a unique combination of musical and extra-musical skills and knowledge. Surprisingly, training for this complex role is limited, and group singing facilitators may not have access to some of the resources that would support them in their work. The aims of this research project were to identify the core skills required by group singing facilitators, to explore their needs for training or professional support, and to develop an accessible set of resources based on the research findings. The project began with a scoping review, which informed the design of two national online surveys for singers and group facilitators. The surveys were followed by an action research project involving singing facilitators who work with groups of singers with experience of living with mental health conditions. The practical outcome of the project was an online ‘toolkit’ of resources informed by the research evidence. Speaker bio: Dr Yoon Irons:
	Yoon is a singer, musician, music therapist, and researcher. Her research focuses on developing and delivering singing programmes for people living with longer-term health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, Parkinson’s, Aphasia, chronic pain, and spinal cord injuries. Yoon is a research fellow at University of Derby, where she conducts the staff orchestra. 
	Professor David Sheffield:
	David's work aims to understand the impact of stress on health, wellbeing and performance. He uses a range of methodologies (e.g. epidemiological, experimental, psychophysiological, interviews). His current research interests include: Nature Connectedness; Music and well-being; Pain and Pain Management in Patients and Athletes; Compassion and mindfulness-based approaches to living; Inequalities and justice in healthcare; and Cardiovascular Responses to Stress. 
	Dr Michael Bonshor:
	Michael has a background as a professional musician, conductor and teacher. He was a co-investigator on the University of Derby’s research project on singing, group facilitation and mental health, and is currently involved in an arts and health project in partnership with the NHS. Michael is Course Director for the University of Sheffield’s MA in Music Psychology in Education, Performance and Wellbeing.
	  To this day, musical leadership remains one of the most male-dominated musical areas. As late as 2013, women conductors achieved a significant first when Marin Alsop became the first woman to conduct the BBC’s Last Night of the Proms. Indeed, musical leadership itself is often constructed as residing in male authority figures, quintessentially exemplified through the maestro conductor. This ‘maestro myth’ (as Norman Lebrecht characterised it, 1997) has been perpetuated since the mid-nineteenth century through the ‘maestro writing tradition’ of male conductors from Berlioz (1843) and Wagner (1869), through Stokowski (1944), Furtwängler (1953), and Boult (1963), to Boulez (2003). This presentation shifts the spotlight to considering women’s musical leadership and explores the impetuses behind the founding of the Women’s Musical Leadership Online Network (WMLON), by the authors in 2019, and also presents its initial findings. With the dual aim of both researching women’s musical leadership and acting as a support network for women musical leaders and potential leaders, WMLON interrogates the current context of women in musical leadership with a specific focus on three areas: women in the music industries, women in educational leadership, and women leading contemporary musical practices. WMLON was established following the first International Conference on Women in/and Musical Leadership, speaks in partnership with the forthcoming Routledge Companion to Women and Musical Leadership: The Nineteenth Century and Beyond, and will be further developed via an AHRC network grant between January 2022 and November 2023. WMLON is open to all. Speaker Bio: Laura Hamer is a Senior Lecturer in Music and Associate Director of Student Support (Arts and Humanities) at The Open University.

Being highly paid to create art might be the goal for any composer, but it is an elite few who reap substantial financial rewards while retaining artistic control. Anecdotal evidence, supported by a 2015 Sound and Music survey, suggests that the majority of UK artists who define themselves as composers, actually earn a small percentage of their income, if anything at all, from their art. Commercial music is another matter: the primary difference being that success is measured in part by financial gain, and artistic quality is ultimately defined by the commissioner. This seminar is a report on a project that I undertook for an advertising agency on behalf of a large international company. I was invited to take part specifically because of my interests in esoteric sound and visual relationships and non-linear programming software, but had to find a way to create something that would appeal to a group who appreciate innovation only if it produces familiar results. I invited composer John Lely to join me in the process and will present a piece of interactive software that we designed to fulfil the commission. As someone who has limited experience of commercial composition, this work has led me to re-evaluate some youthful ideologies and question the nature of artistic satisfaction as well as the issue of dissemination of practice as research. Speaker Bio: Professor Dominic Murcott is a composer, percussionist, curator and educator based in London. Beginning as a self-taught musician he played drums and percussion with many influential bands and is the vibraphonist with art-pop outfit The High Llamas. Recording has been with Stereolab, Pavement and St Etienne to name a few. Changing direction he studied music formally and received a PhD in Composition from Goldsmiths College before being made Head of Composition at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. Now in his 19th year in the post, the department is oversubscribed and renown for its innovative approach to composition training. An expert on the music of Conlon Nancarrow, he lectures, curates festivals and undertakes public speaking around the world. Recent compositions include The Harmonic Canon, a piece for US/Japanese percussionists arx duo featuring a computer designed custom-made 1⁄2 ton double bell. Premiered at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival it available in glorious vinyl on nonclassical and won a 2018 BASCA British Composer Award. An avid forager and consumer of interesting food, in May 2019 he presented a special event at the British Library on taste in food and music with legendary chef Heston Blumenthal. The right hand in the bell of a horn serves several functions. On a mundane level the hand assists in the instrument being in a position in which it can be played, but the soft flesh of the hand also aids the timbre of the instrument and the exact position of the hand is essential for fine tuning. With historical instruments and their associated techniques the right hand can have a greater or lesser importance. For some early works the instrument is played without the insertion of the hand into the bell and for others the musician manipulates their right hand in the bell in order to create notes (“hand technique”). The position of the hand (or even the absence of the hand) greatly affects the timbre. Another way of changing the timbre is to use a mute, however this requires the musician to break off from playing in order to insert the mute. Whilst composers normally accommodate this in the music (writing an adequate number of bars preceding and following the con sordino passage) a significant number of nineteenth-century compositions exist where no such allowances have been made. Some of these later ones can be “accommodated” as it is possible to almost create the affect of a mute on valved instruments by using the right hand in lieu of a mute but this option is not available to the earlier natural instruments. In this seminar I will illustrate the problems inherent in these works, suggest solutions based on ideas that many nineteenth century HIP practitioners are currently exploring concerning tempo flexibility and dislocation, and discuss how the solutions may themselves suggest further ideas about the tempo flexibility composer/performers had in mind. Speaker Bio Anneke Scott is a leading exponent of historical horn playing. Her work takes her throughout the globe and throughout the centuries of music with a repertoire incorporating music and instruments from the late seventeenth century through to the present day.Anneke is principal horn of a number of internationally renowned period instrument ensembles including Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and the English Baroque Soloists, ensemble Pygmalion, The Orchestra of the Sixteen, the Irish Baroque Orchestra, and the Dunedin Consort and Players and many others. Anneke enjoys an international solo career and discography embracing three centuries of virtuosic horn works. Her expertise in baroque horn repertoire ensures that she is frequently to be heard performing the famous obligato arias of composers such as Bach and Handel as well as solo concertos from this period. Her critically acclaimed solo recordings also include three discs focussing on the music of the leading Parisian horn player of the nineteenth century; Jaques-François Gallay. Anneke enjoys collaborating with a wide group of musicians and is a key member of a number of chamber music ensembles including The Prince Regent's Band andBoxwood & Brass. She regularly works with leading period keyboardists including Steven Devine, Neal Peres da Costa, Geoffrey Govier and Kathryn Cok and period harpist Frances Kelly. She teaches at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, University of Birmingham. In 2018 she was awarded Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Music and in 2019 she was one of the recipients of the International Horn Society “Punto Award”. More information on her work can be found at www.annekescott.com The dissemination of Christianity was banned in Korea until the late nineteenth century, but by the end of the twentieth century Protestant Christianity was the most popular religion in (South) Korea. Despite the tremendous impact of this religion on various domains in Korea, including music, it has eluded Anglophone music studies, given this discipline’s tendency to treat the Western world and the non-Western world as separate cultural spheres. This talk considers how we might tell the history of Korean Christian music as a site of circulation, transformation, and agency. It focuses on the first decades of Protestantism in Korea, when the North American missionaries had immense power over indigenous Christian communities. It explores the musical culture that formed in this milieu in terms of a range of Christian artefacts which were forged in the context of Korean socio-cultural heterogeneity and in the crucible of early twentieth-century trans-Pacific history, marked by the rise of the U.S. and Japan as regional powers. Speaker Bio: Hannah Hyun Kyong Chang is a Lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield. She obtained her PhD in Musicology from UCLA, with a dissertation fellowship from the American Musicological Society (AMS). Subsequently, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University's Institute of Sacred Music and a visiting assistant professor at the Department of Music, New York University. She is currently working on a project called “Pacific Voicings: Korean Hymns and Prayers in the Age of Empire, 1884-1945” as a recipient of an AHRC Research, Development, and Engagement Fellowship. Her next project will examine modernist composers in Korea and Japan. She currently serves on the AMS Council and is a co-convenor of AMS's Global Music History Study Group. In this talk I’ll present early results of a study concerned with sound recordings in early music appreciation, part of a larger ongoing grant by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. In particular, I’ll present a tentative conception, that of music depreciation, or the deliberate classifying of music as lesser and of lower quality. This conception is evident in the early engagement by those working in music appreciation as they addressed the music of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC). I will reveal how a set of criteria for appreciating classical music was misapplied to BIPOC music, resulting in an active program of music depreciation in the most popular music teaching texts of that era. These materials, present primarily via sound recording and textbooks, reveal widespread practices of music depreciation, the labelling of BIPOC music as uncivilised, uncultured, primitive, and illiterate. Following Ewell’s (2020) call for intersectional analysis of music theory’s white racial frame, and using a theoretical framework drawn from sound studies, I will argue that a critical intersectional reengagement with the racist and classist origins of music appreciation can help make the case for setting new foundations for teaching about music, following similar calls to de-sacralise listening (Rinsema, 2018), to adopt a diasporic approach (Gustafson, 2020), or to work with multimedia approaches that rest on Black music theory (Thibeault, 2021) all in an effort to continue to decolonise and otherwise confront some of music education’s most problematic and least understood histories. Speaker Bio: Matthew D. Thibeault is Associate Professor of Culture and Creative Arts at the Education University of Hong Kong. His recent research draws on frameworks from sound studies to illuminate the enmeshment of sound recordings and music pedagogy across the 20th century. He maintains active engagement with participatory music through the ukulele, banjo, and Okinawan sanshin. Thibeault’s publications and other details can be found on his professional website: www.matthewthibeault.com Suk-Jun Kim studied theology at Yonsei university, South Korea and Recording Engineering at OIART (Ontario Institute of Audio and Recording Technology). He earned a master’s degree in Music Technology in Northwestern University and a Ph.D. in composition at the University of Florida. Currently, Kim is senior lecturer in Electroacoustic Music and Sound Art at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and Director of PG Research in the School of Language, Literature, Music, and Visual Culture. As a composer and sound artist, Kim has won several international composition awards and attracted commissions. Kim was a DAAD resident composer between 2009-2010. Kim has written two books - Hasla and Humming – and is now working on new project on sound studies, including one that examines key aspects that have established the audience in the 21st century.
	  We often hear composers and sound artists say “Listen!” with an apostrophe. But what else would it mean to listen, if it is not an act of lending our ears to something that is not our own? In this talk, Suk-Jun Kim focusses on three incidents in which we lend our ears for listening, which have been explored in his recent book, Humming: John Cage with his Lecture on Nothing, A King from Italo Calvino’s short story, A King Listens, and humming, a vocalic act closest to being mute, or silence. ""Perception of emotion and meaning in music is to a large extent probabilistic rather  than deterministic. Certain properties of music may increase the likelihood that a  particular emotion is perceived over another or a particular imagery or association  is evoked. What emotion or imagery is perceived also depends on contextual factors such as the apriori probability of emotions, listeners’ sensitivities and biases, 
	and the distinctives of the properties within the musical context. In this presentation,  I will explore the use of Bayes’ rule to model the perception of emotion and meaning, and to capture the influence of these contextually shaping factors. Considering emotion perception, according to Bayes’ rule, the posterior probability of perceiving an emotion given a musical property M is equal to the likelihood of the  observation of the musical property if the hypothesis of that emotion was true, times  the prior probability of that emotion (in the context of competing emotions). To  develop this method, measures of prior probability of emotions are required as well 
	as probability estimates of musical properties in emotional expressions. Analogously, the posterior probability of multimodal imagery given musical property M is equal to the likelihood of that musical property in the context of the hypothesised multimodal phenomenon, additionally taking into account the prior probability of the phenomenon and the frequency of occurrence of the musical property across multimodal phenomena. Finally, probability calculations can be used to examine relationships between emotion and meaning in music: what is the posterior probability of an emotion given a multimodal association or vice versa what is the probability of a given multimodal imagery given an emotion?  Data from existing research articles are used to get a proof of concept of these applications of Bayes’ rule to model perception of emotion and meaning in music. Future directions for research are discussed as well as benefits and limitations of the adoption of a Bayesian approach to music cognition."" Description How does a listener know immediately when she or he walks into a room with a live grand piano instead of a recording? One reason is the complex interactions between the piano sound and the space that surrounds it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is ubiquitous, yet often ignores the spatial presence of the live instrument and performer. Yet research in the field of music perception points to the essential role of situated or embodied cognition our listening experience. My composition Cosmologies for piano and three-dimensional electronics seeks to place the embodied presence of the instrument and its performer at the centre, using machine learning of audio features to decipher the intricate interdependencies of timbre and space that bring an instrument to life. The results explode the space inside the piano out to the space of the concert hall, creating a virtual reality (VR) environment for the ears, and situating the listener inside the instrument to experience its secret inner life. Speaker's bio: Aaron Einbond’s work explores the intersection of instrumental music, field recording, sound installation, and interactive technology. He released portrait album Without Words with Ensemble Dal Niente on Carrier Records and Cities with Yarn/Wire and Matilde Meireles on multi.modal/NMC Recordings. His awards include a Giga-Hertz Förderpreis, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and artistic research residencies at IRCAM and ZKM. He teaches music composition, sound, and technology at City, University of London. The advent of the performing hologram opens up significant questionsaround the fate of “liveness” in the digital age, blurring if not collapsing distinctions between absence/presence, live/real, original/copy as well
	as transforming well-worn ideas such as authenticity. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Japan and the UK, this talk explores the case of virtual idol, Hatsune Miku, originally a marketing mascot for voice synthesis software but who now tours globally and is a representative agent of a new breed of virtual performers. As well as introducing the Miku media model – a relatively flat media ecology where fans are also Miku producers – the talk will offer some speculative thoughts on how a Miku performance “works” as an assemblage of love, labour and socio-technical affordances. Who or what is performing, how is liveness managed when the performer is pure code, and what does this tell us about relations between live music, participatory cultures and virtuality? In this talk, I draw on my recently published book, ‘Class, Control, and Classical Music’ (Oxford University Press, 2019), to discuss why, in the UK, classical music remains predominantly played by white middle-class people. I draw on data from an ethnographic study with young people playing in classical music ensembles in the south of England to explain how the inclusions and exclusions that are visible today were set up historically in the establishment of music education institutions in the late Victorian period. The link between class and classical music is also apparent in the social relations of classical music pedagogy, such as what I am calling a ‘pedagogy of correction’. These social relations are not, I argue, separate from the music itself, but are in part formed by the demands of classical music’s distinctive aesthetic, repertoire, and instruments. These demands create an aesthetic ideal of ‘getting it right’. This means that in order to change the demographic patterns of who plays classical music, the aesthetic itself will need to change. Speakers Bio: Dr Anna Bull is a Senior Lecturer in sociology at the University of Portsmouth. Her research interests include class and gender inequalities in classical music education; and staff sexual misconduct in higher education. Anna has published in leading sociology and music education journals and her monograph Class, Control, and Classical music, looking at the culture of classical music among young middle class classical musicians in the south of England, was published in 2019 by Oxford University Press, and in 2020 was joint winner of the Philip Abrams Memorial Prize from the British Sociological Association. Anna is also a director of The 1752 Group (https://1752group.com/), a research and campaigning organisation working to address staff sexual misconduct in higher education. Lillis Ó Laoire is Professor of Irish Language and Folklore at NUI Galway. He has published on the song traditions of Tory Island and with Sean Williams an award winning biography of Joe Heaney. He is a noted performer being awarde TG4 traditional singer of the year in 2020. Sean-nós song is regarded by many as the hegemonic core of Irish Traditional Music (ITM). Central to sean-nós are themes of erotic love and loss. Irish Traditional Music is conventionally regarded as conservative in outlook, reinforcing heteronormative binary gender identities, thus creating a challenging environment for those identifying as LGBTQ+, who also enjoy performing or consuming traditional music. This paper will briefly outline the rationale of such a conservative outlook within a cultural nationalistic framework, before exploring some transgressive examples, showing that 'tradition' and 'heternormativity' are not necessarily synonymous. This aims to open a space for the recognition and validation of non-binary histories within ITM, and especially within the song tradition. Research and public discourse on the social impact of making music (recently, also called SIMM) have become more visible in the last ten years, accounting for a diversity of situations, in which music practices play an active role in processes of social transformation, at different levels. Juan Rojas will provide a perspective on the current landscape of SIMM activities in Colombia, as studied within the framework of the larger international research project, “Music for Social Impact: Practitioners’ work, context, and beliefs.” The project aims at comparing between the findings in four countries—Colombia, Belgium, Finland, and the UK—but the talk will revolve around the organizational, cultural, and political aspects that have shaped the Colombian SIMM field, with occasional comparisons, for context. In Colombia, SIMM activities seem to be notoriously divided between small grassroots organizations and large national level institutional programs, both focusing on the attention of vulnerable and marginalized populations, mostly people in conditions of poverty or victims of the armed conflict. This divide is a partial result of the implementation of neoliberal policies of cultural decentralization since the 1990s, which restricted regional budgets, while privileging national-level programs focused on Western classical musics. While this model caters for thousands of people, local SIMM activities, which include a wide range of culturally diverse musical practices, are mostly unattended in a nation that publicly praises its cultural diversity. Is this problematic? This presentation explores the Colombian case from a cross-cultural perspective, aiming at future understandings of the larger SIMM field. Speakers Bio Juan S. Rojas is a Colombian ethnomusicologist, musician, and anthropologist. He received his Ph.D. in ethnomusicology at Indiana University Bloomington, in 2018, and is an experienced researcher and performer of diverse Afro-Diasporic musical expressions, specializing in traditional and popular Colombian musics. His dissertation, titled “Drums, Raps, and Song-Games: An Ethnography of Music and Peacebuilding in the Afro-Colombian Town of Libertad,” explores the potential contributions of local musics to processes of conflict transformation. He teaches ensemble courses and graduate seminars at University of El Bosque and University of Los Andes, in Colombia and is a member of the research team at Sonidos Enraizados Cultural Corporation. He currently holds a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the project “Music for Social Impact: Practitioners’ work, context, and beliefs,” hosted by Guildhall School of Music and Drama, as part of his work at the UNESCO Chair in Education, Arts, and a Culture of Peace, at Juan N. Corpas University Foundation (Colombia). Lewis Granom’s Plain and easy instructions for playing on the German flute is significant in being the earliest work on the pedagogy of the instrument by a named English author. Legal records recently discovered in The National Archives reveal that the treatise had an extraordinary genesis, being largely the product of lessons given by Granom to its dedicatee, John Bourke, a wealthy Irish landowner who was incarcerated for debt in the King’s Bench Prison at the time. The litigation that followed the breakdown of their friendship sheds light on a range of matters, including the patron/composer relationship, their musical tastes and views regarding Handel’s posthumous reputation, the sources used to compile the Instructions, the cost of music lessons, copying and other related expenses, and the cultural and social life of one of London’s more salubrious gaols. Speakers Bio Cheryll Duncan is a Senior Lecturer in Music at the RNCM. Her research investigates professional music culture in Britain during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with a particular focus on records of the equity and common-law courts. She has published several articles in leading musicological journals, and contributed a chapter to Geminiani Studies (ed. C. Hogwood). Her monograph on the violinist and composer Felice Giardini was published in 2020. Florence Price (1887–1953) is often described as the first African American woman to achieve national and international success as a composer. However, this deserved accolade tends to exceptionalize her achievements as a female composer of African descent and thus to obscure or negate the rich context in which she worked. “Composing a Symphonist: Florence Price and the Hand of Black Women’s Fellowship” resituates Price in the dynamic cultural movement of the Black Chicago Renaissance and recognizes how a number of African American women played diverse and crucial roles within it. I illuminate Price’s Chicago, in which a female-led community shaped an American art music that uplifted black musical idioms. Positioning Price’s transition from Little Rock, Arkansas, against the backdrop of the Great Migration, the unfolding narrative explores the first six years in which she lived in Chicago (1927–1933); it delves into the community that awaited her and the particular influence of Nora Douglas Holt, Estella Conway Bonds, and Maude Roberts George in her ascent to become the first nationally-recognized black female symphonist. The result is a geographical and socio-cultural mapping of Price’s Chicago that reveals the clasped hand of black women’s fellowship. Speakers Bio Dr. Samantha Edge is the Lord Crewe Junior Research Fellow in Music at Lincoln College, University of Oxford. She is a leading interpreter and scholar of the African American composer Florence B. Price. She received the Society for American Music’s Eileen Southern Fellowship (2019) and a Newberry Library Short-Term Residential Fellowship (2019) for her work on women's contributions to concert life in interwar Chicago. She has written for American Music, Women and Music, and the Kapralova Society Journal. She released Four Women: Music for Solo Piano by Price, Kaprálová, Bilsland and Bonds with Wave Theory Records in 2018. Her latest album is called Fantasie Nègre: The Piano Music of Florence Price. Join at: https://zoom.us/j/99483467755 This talk will focus on a recent collaboration between myself and Sarah Watts which used Machine Learning as a third collaborator in the creation of a new piece for contrabass clarinet and track. The aim of our research was to use Machine Learning as an objective observer of the idiosyncratic behaviours exhibited in either our performance or composition practices and to create a piece that documented these behaviours within it. We trained our chosen algorithm (PRiSM SampleRNN) on recordings of Sarah’s improvisations and of my compositions. This generated new audio samples, exhibiting behaviours that the algorithm had ‘learnt’ from our original data. These samples, representative of an artificial space between Sarah and I were used to create a new work: ‘You may own us but we are going to inform on you’. This piece aimed to give equal space to all collaborators. In this talk I will discuss the social and ethical concerns and benefits that arose from giving a non-human this position in the collaboration.  Biography: Ellen Sargen is an alumna of The University of Sheffield (BMus, MA) and is currently studying for a PhD in Composition at the Royal Northern College of Music, supported by the North West Consortium";https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/music/research/research-seminars;

 This subject is designed to produce graduates with a broad range of skills that can be employed in a number of professional contexts. Great emphasis is also placed on the development of transferable vocational skills, enabling you to access a diverse range of less obvious career pathways. My name is Sarah and I have just completed second year at the University of Limerick, studying Irish and Music as part of a four year Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Degree programme. A key piece of advice received in secondary school was to  “study something you like doing” and that for me was always going to involve music in some shape or form. The BA Degree at UL provided the ideal opportunity to fulfil the musical half of my dream. The programme is very flexible, for instance this year I was given the opportunity to take on some extra music modules, required to possibly pursue a career as a teacher somewhere down the line.  These extra modules involved elements of performance and composition and were delivered by the very best of tutors. I have found the UL music faculty to be very approachable and are always available to encourage and support their students. The support extends beyond the core academic content and I have benefitted, on more than one occasion, from focussed technical performance advice. The Academy encourages Irish traditional  music sessions and I have got great enjoyment from getting to know and playing with many other young musicians over the past year, all realised while carefully observing the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic. It was a good decision to study Music at UL and I look forward with a keen sense of anticipation to the next two years and beyond.

A tribute to Yang Yinliu | Stephen Jones: a blog;"Yang Yinliu, 1950. Since I mentioned Yang Yinliu’s groundbreaking work on the Zhihua temple, he too richly deserves a tribute. Indeed, since soundscape is such a basic aspect of Chinese culture, his work should form a basic training for us all. Yang Yinliu 楊蔭瀏 / 杨荫浏 (1899–1984) is often described in mediaspeak as “the Chinese Bartók”, but Bartók should rather be described as “the Hungarian Yang Yinliu”. A fine musician and fieldworker, erudite historian, and incidentally a Protestant, Yang’s whole oeuvre was remarkable. Brought up in the final years of the Qing dynasty in the milieu of the Daoist instrumental music and the refined Kunqu vocal dramas of the Wuxi area near Shanghai, Yang was a fine exponent of qin zither, pipa and sanxian plucked lutes, and the ethereal falsetto singing of Kunqu (I haven’t yet found my copy of the precious recording from the 1920s found recently in Berlin). He learned instruments from Daoist priests (including Abing) from the age of six, joining the elite Tianyun she society. In Wuxi, under the tuition of the American missionary Louise Strong Hammond, he studied English and Western music theory. He also became an active Christian. He went on to gain a cosmopolitan education in Shanghai, attending St John’s University from 1923. After returning to Wuxi in 1926, he was married in 1928, becoming a professor at Yenching University in Beijing in 1936. Offered a job in the USA heading a Chinese music institute there, he commented, “I can do nothing if I leave Chinese soil, where Chinese music lives.” After the Japanese occupation in 1937, and through the troubled 1940s, not inclined to join the Communist base area in Yan’an, Yang moved from Nanjing to posts in Kunming and Chongqing, always continuing his research. The Wuxi Daoists
Yang and his cousin Cao Anhe returned regularly to Wuxi, where they were engaged in a long-term project studying the music of the local Daoists. Of their two major books on the theme, their work on Shifan gu was first published in 1957, Yang’s on Shifan luogu not until 1980. In some respects Yang seems like a traditional historical musicologist rather than an ethnographer; but he was well aware of complex social issues. This passage on the position of Daoists in Wuxi society illustrates his sophisticated interest in ethnography and ritual practice, besides his more traditional “musicological” concerns: [1] In the past [?!], Buddhists in south Jiangsu divided into two types, Chan school (chanmen) and Auxiliary school (fumen). Those of the Chan school were completely vegetarian, and didn’t have families. They only used percussion like woodblock, bowl, nao and bo cymbals, and tonggu drum to punctuate their vocal liturgy; they didn’t play any melodic instrumental pieces. They never took part in production, living in their temples, some of which had large estates. The Auxiliary school ate meat and had families. Few in number, they lived scattered in the villages, taking part in agriculture and only reciting the scriptures and litanies as an auxiliary occupation. Among the Buddhists, they are the only ones who play the fanyin [melodic instrumental repertoire] and [separate] percussion items. Among the Daoists, the Complete Perfection (Quanzhen) school (belonging to the Qingchengshan style of Sichuan) were similar to the Buddhist Chan school, not using separate percussion items or silk-and-bamboo instruments. Those who played the fanyin and separate percussion items mostly belonged to the Zhang Heavenly Masters school of Longhushan in Jiangxi. Among the latter group, there was a further clear class distinction. A minority of abbots possessed ritual titles of the Zhang Heavenly Masters, like “Master who Guard the Way” (daoweishi) or “Ritual Master” (fashi), and mostly owned land. They didn’t take part in production. They interacted with landlords and the bourgeoisie in the cities and villages, taking ritual work and contacting and hiring the common village Daoists to take part in major rituals (daochang fashi). These common Daoists mostly took part in agricultural production, being hired ad hoc: performing for rituals was an auxiliary occupation for them. In both agriculture and Daoism, they were an exploited class. These common Daoists—even the indispensable drummers and flute players, with their excellent musical technique—only got a tiny wage for a whole day’s work. Conversely, the “Masters who Guard the Way” and “Ritual Masters”, having only taken responsibility for quite brief ritual segments of a few hours like Issuing the Talismans (fafu), Reporting the Memorial (zoubiao), and Flaming Mouth (yankou), claimed a reward many times higher than that of the others. Those who played music were mostly the common semi-peasant Daoists; very few of the “Masters who Guard the Way” and “Ritual Masters” could do so. This shows that in the past it was agricultural life that produced and developed music. Never mind the diplomatic PC spin (for “reading between the lines”, see my article cited under Hunan below), Yang had already observed the important distinctions common to local ritual cultures all over China, long before the major projects on local Daoist ritual since the 1980s. [2]  Shifan gu and Shifan luogu, c1962. Nearby, the Daoist rituals of Suzhou were also thoroughly documented in an amazing 1956 project. Following such early work, major studies of the Daoist rituals of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Shanghai have been made since the 1990s. [3] The Music Research Institute
After the 1949 “Liberation” Yang’s erudition was much needed. Managing to adapt to the new Communist regime, he was appointed director of the newly-formed National Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music (predecessor of the Music Research Institute [MRI] of the Chinese Academy of Arts), beginning a golden age for research there. Under his committed guidance they accumulated a large archive of field recordings and traditional notations. A qin player himself, he was closely involved with all his eminent colleagues’ research on qin (see my series on The qin zither under Maoism, starting here).  The golden age of the MRI, 1954;
right to left Guan Pinghu, Yang Yinliu, Pu Xuezhai, Zha Fuxi, Li Yuanqing.
. In due course the MRI was given a new building (typically, soon dilapidated) in Dongzhimenwai in the northeast of the city. Even in the 1980s, when it became my home base between field trips, its bare dingy corridors were animated by the spirits of the old masters. The new compound, further out in Huixinxijie, is less characterful. Yang Yinliu and Cao Anhe at the MRI, 1961. Both before and after Liberation, until the early 1960s, in collaboration with other fine scholars—notably his cousin and lifelong companion Cao Anhe (1905-2004)—Yang managed both to perform remarkable research on a range of living traditions and to compile major collections and transcriptions of traditional notation. Just as important was his monumental history, first in draft from 1944, covering with unique erudition the whole of Chinese music history, and elite as well as folk genres, albeit couched in the language of its time. His most renowned recording—on another trip home to Wuxi in summer 1950—of pipa and erhu solos by the blind beggar Abing, is perhaps his least interesting. Abing was once among the Daoists whose company Yang kept in his youth, but the 1950 recording was a casual event, on a day off from working with the Daoists who were his main focus. His work on the Zhihua temple followed on from his 1952 monograph (with Cao Anhe) of the “Songs for Winds” band from Ziwei village in Hebei during their 1950 visit to Tianjin—a band still active when Xue Yibing and I visited them from 1989. In summer 1953 Yang made an important visit to Xi’an to investigate the music (and scores) of local ritual groups; and he drew attention to the ritual music of Shanxi, notably the Buddhist mountains of Wutaishan—also later to become major scholarly themes in China. [4] With Cao Anhe and Jian Qihua he also took part in a project to transnotate a rare score of the “suite plucking” repertoire of old Beijing. For more evidence of his good taste, see here. Hunan, 1956
Along with his historical research, Yang Yinliu did all kinds of fieldwork. Just as remarkable as his studies with the Wuxi Daoists was a major fieldwork trip he led to Hunan province in 1956, amidst escalating collectivisation. There Yang Yinliu headed a team documenting all kinds of ceremonial music-making, notably ritual and customary musics. Despite the politically correct language of the published volume, they seem to have taken what they found. The resulting “Report on a survey of the musics of Hunan” (Hunan yinyue pucha baogao, 1960) has 618 pages, besides separate mimeographs on Confucian and Buddhist ritual. I’ve written about it at greater length here. This, the first general survey of all the genres of a given area, was an influential blueprint for later regional surveys from the 1980s, notably the Anthology of folk music of the Chinese peoples, on which see my The energy of those times at the MRI, in the midst of increasing political control, was remarkable. Also wide-ranging was an early fieldtrip to Fujian for two and a half months in the winter of 1961–62, led by Li Quanmin, and published in 1963. [5] In 1962 Yang Yinliu published a masterly overview of Chinese notation in his Gongchepu qianshuo 工尺谱浅说. All this extraordinary work was carried out under the most taxing conditions. Worse was to come: academics and peasants alike, as representatives of the “Four Olds”, suffered grievously after the Four Cleanups campaigns began in 1963. In May 1965—after the end of the campaigns, when over thirty MRI employees had undergone Socialist Education in Chang’an county, Shaanxi—they celebrated their temporary freedom with a visit to Huashan: In the row behind, fifth from left is the trusty Li Wenru (for whom, see here). Source: Yang Yinliu jinian wenji. As the Cultural Revolution broke out, even in the Hebei village camp where Yang and others were sent for “re-education” he furtively continued research, including studies (along with Huang Xiangpeng, another distinguished colleague) of the 1972 excavation of the Han tombs at Mawangdui (see e.g. Micic, p.104). During this period Yang’s colleagues members of the elite qin fraternity were also given permission to continue their studies. “How to assess religious music”
Within the confines of the day, Yang Yinliu paid just as much attention to “literati” and “religious” culture as to more popular genres (pace Joseph Lam). Indeed, Yang was perhaps predisposed to studying early music history; and it wasn’t so much post-Liberation ideology that drew him to popular living genres, but his own training in performance (Kunqu, Daoists and so on). In the useful article he discusses Yang’s own article “Ruhe duidai woguode zongjiao yinyue” 如何对待我国的宗教音乐 [How to treat religious music], Wenhui bao 1961.3 (also reproduced in the 2013 Yang Yinliu jinian wenji), written just as a very brief lull in extreme leftist policies followed the climb-down after the terrible famine. Meanwhile scholars had been discussing the classification of genres; their framework was enshrined in the 1964 Minzu yinyue gailun [Survey of Chinese music]. Despite the separate and subsidiary place of “religious music”, they were aware that ritual practice pervaded all genres of rural performance. Indeed, Yang seems to have been the first to use the term “ritual music” (yishi yinyue ) in China. [1] From 1959 he also spent many years revising his masterwork Zhongguo gudai yinyue shi gao [Draft history of Chinese music], which was finally published in 1981. Covering literati, palace, folk, and religious traditions required him to take great care over how to couch his language. So in his 1961 article he was subtly, and boldly, justifying the very need to study ritual traditions, using the language of class struggle while attempting to refine it. It will hardly satisfy modern anthropologists of religion; indeed, it makes a rather severe test of our ability to interpret writings of the time. Of course, in the 1950s the tenets of ethnomusicology were still far from common even in the West. Yang’s use of language shows the hoops that scholars had to jump through in order to get on with documenting the diverse genres. After the downfall of the Gang of Four in 1976 and the demise of the commune system, Yang Yinliu finally saw his great history formally published, and cultural and academic life restored. Though he lived long enough to witness the revival of tradition, he could hardly have imagined how widespread it would become, and how important the study of ritual and its soundscape was to be. How he would have delighted in the renewed energy of the Anthology and later fieldwork projects! His interests may have been more directed towards the “salvage” of genres common in his own youth and throughout imperial history, but I think he would have understood the value of documenting their fortunes since Liberation, even if that was still to remain a sensitive subject.  The Protestant hymns of Yang Yinliu
Unlike Bartók, Yang wasn’t also a composer. Except… As a coda to this little tribute, the 2-CD set from Wind Records ends with a touching hymn that Yang wrote in 1934, a simple harmonization of the qin piece Yangguan sandie:  I was most moved to hear the Beijing Protestant Church Choir sing it at a memorial concert for Yang in November 1999. His Christian background has long been recognized, but only with the liberalizations since his death did it become possible in China to admit, sotto voce, that he remained a Christian all his life. This makes his hymns all the more moving, especially bearing in mind all the silent tribulations since the 1940s of Chinese Christians, along with artists, intellectuals, and peasants. * * * Along with my Chinese friends, some of whom were his pupils, I can’t help feeling a deep nostalgia for the golden days of the MRI. Yang Yinliu’s combination of encyclopedic knowledge and musicianship are likely to remain unmatched. If only my other great mentor, Laurence Picken, had been able to confer with him! Like many ethnomusicologists, I no longer want to be limited by the narrow association with “music”, but while Yang Yinliu’s writings are wide-ranging as well as profound, his focus on “music” was also admirable. Finally, two suitable quotes from a junior colleague of Yang (see Peter Micic’s second comment below), and a pupil, [6] who were also to become my mentors: Yang Yinliu was a large tree full of lush leaves and branches reaching high into the sky. I can only caress each branch and leaf with my hands.Yang was a bridge between the ancient and the modern, Chinese and foreign. I’m still walking along that bridge that Yang built.   —Huang Xiangpeng (for whom, see Peter Micic’s comment below) Through him, Chinese music history was freed from the shackles of the text, allowing the music and the musicians to take centre stage.   —Qiao Jianzhong With two distinguished successors of Yang Yinliu at the MRI, 1989: Huang Xiangpeng (left) and Qiao Jianzhong. Alas, I arrived in Beijing in 1986 a couple of years too late to pay homage to Yang Yinliu in person. But his spirit animates us all. Selected resources [1] Sunan chuidaqu, 1957 edition, pp.11–12. This passage was cut from the 1982 edition. There may be a story to tell here: perhaps such material was still more sensitive when they revised the text around 1980 than it had been even in 1957.

"Vol. 16 No. 1 (2021): Special Issue on Open Science in Musicology
							| Empirical Musicology Review";"Empirical Musicology Review (EMR) aims to provide an international forum promoting the understanding of music in all of its facets. In particular, EMR aims to facilitate communication and debate between scholars engaged in systematic and observation-based music scholarship. Debate is promoted through publication of commentaries on research articles. Scope EMR publishes original research articles, commentaries, editorials, book reviews, interviews, letters, and data sets. Suitable topics include music history, performance, theory, education, and composition -- with an emphasis on systematic methods, such as hypothesis-testing, modeling, and controlled observation. Submissions pertaining to social, political, cultural and economic phenomena are welcome. Theoretical and speculative articles are welcome provided they contribute to the forming of empirically testable hypotheses, models or theories, or they provide critiques of methodology.  History EMR was founded by David Huron and David Butler in 2004 and began publishing in January 2006. The editorial process for EMR pioneers a new ""Public Peer Review"" practice that is intended to encourage scholarly dialog and reward reviewers for timely and thoughtful engagement with submissions. Previous editors include David Butler, William Forde Thompson, Peter Keller, Nicola Dibben and Renee Timmers. The current editors are Daniel Shanahan and Daniel Müllensiefen.

CfP: New Perspectives in Popular Music Research: Changes and Turmoil (Deadline 3 Feb. 2022) | PopHistory;"Conference: University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway, 1–2 June 2022 Recent years have resulted in extensive changes in popular music production, dissemination, reception, and perception. New technological developments within music production and performance have created new creative possibilities for artists and bands as they make music and engage with the global music market. Many of these changes have been greatly accelerated by, if not the direct result of, the Covid 19 pandemic that has fundamentally disturbed the relationships between artists, fans, modes of performance, and music distribution. More than ever before, it has become critical to examine digitization, virtuality, creativity, and the music business as a whole in the context of such tumultuous changes. Thus, a two-day conference on new perspectives in popular music research will be held by the Department of Popular Music, Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Agder (UiA) in cooperation with the Popular Music Research Unit at UiA. The overarching goal of this conference is to address new perspectives on popular music through the lens of these recent changes and the perceived turmoil (and benefits) that has resulted from them. This marks the fourteenth anniversary of our PhD programme in popular music performance and provides an opportunity to showcase work by former graduates, current PhD candidates, and scholars associated with music research within the broad field of popular music studies. Two international keynote speakers will frame and contextualize the event. Keynote speakers will be announced early January 2022. It is also envisaged that contributors will have the opportunity to have their papers published through an international peer review channel. Proposals for 20-minute presentations consisting of 200 words and a brief biographical note (stating your qualifications and institutional affiliations) should be received by 3 February 2022 and addressed to: tor.dybo@uia.no We welcome proposals that deal in particular with the following themes: • Popular music and identity in the 21st Century• Social media and popular music• Virtuality, space, and place• New music technologies• Digitization• Distribution• Impact of Covid 19 in the live music sector• Music business and management• New technological developments in electronic music production• New developments in music dissemination and performance Organizing committee: • Professor Tor Dybo• Research Fellow Jelena Mijatovic• Research Fellow Zachary Bresler Advisory board: • Professor Michael Rauhut• Dr. Daniel Nordgård Practical information: • The seminar is free of charge and refreshments will be included.• The venue is University of Agder in Kristiansand, Norway: https://www.uia.no/en• The university has special rates with various hotels in Kristiansand. Michael Rauhut, Dr. phil., born in 1963, studied musicology at Humboldt University (HU) in Berlin, worked at the Research Centre for Popular Music Studies (Forschungszentrum Populäre Musik) at HU, at the Institute for Contemporary Historical Youth Research (Institut für zeitgeschichtliche Jugendforschung) in Berlin and at the Research Centre for Contemporary History (Forschungsstelle für Zeitgeschichte) in Hamburg. Since 2008, Rauhut has been a professor of popular music at the University of Agder in Kristiansand, Norway.

WWLT, Vol 1. No. 1 – KPK: Kpop Kollective;"Welcome to the inaugural issue of WWLT, or What We’re Listening To, which features mini music analyses that provide context and introduce readers to K-pop music that may be new-to-them.  This issue features tracks from EXO, TVXQ, Jeon Somi, CL, Jonghyun X Youngbae, VIXX, Red Velvet, SEVENTEEN, SF9 and 2AM from contributors who are members of the K-pop music research accelerator, HWAITING! (managed by KPK: Kpop Kollective). Crystal S. Anderson EXO follows in the footsteps of large groups at SM Entertainment, including Super Junior and Girls’ Generation. In addition to the creation of sub-units (EXO-K and EXO-M; EXO-CBX) several members embarked on solo careers, including D.O, Baekhyun, Lay and Suho.  The group is known for its impressive choreography to upbeat, rhythm-driven dance tracks. “Stronger” appears on  the 2016 album, Ex’Act, which was repackaged as Lotto later that year. Ex’Act was released after Exodus (2015), which included “Call Me Baby”, and Love Me Right, which was released the same year with the title song as the promo track. Agnes Shin, Chung Joo-hee, Lee Joo-hyung,  Andreas Oberg,  Gustav Karlstrom wrote the lyrics and Karlstrom, Lee, Oberg composed the music. “Stronger” departs from EXO’s uptempo tracks by showcasing vocals accompanied only by a piano at a slower pace. The piano creates sparse instrumentation without electronic songs, which makes the vocals shine even more. Relying on members Suho, Baekhyun, Chen and D.O., the track showcases their individual vocal talents as well as their harmonization, traversing the gamut of the vocal range and using various vocalists to punctuate the vocal performance of others. The structure of the song is also non-traditional, diverging from a straight verse-chorus arrangement.  This track offers a different side of the group, showing vocal versatility as an additional element to their dance repertoire.  Sources EXO. “Stronger.” YouTube. 8 Nov 2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuDhioEWnMI (29 Oct 2021)     N. Lina Anuar After debuting with the song Hug on Boxing Day 2003, then 5-member group TVXQ from SM Entertainment released Tri-Angle from their first studio album The Way U Are in 2004. The music video of this song emulated the aesthetics of visual-Kei like elaborate hairstyles and makeup (Throwback Thoughts, 2019), which one could trace back to the times of glam rock of KISS and David Bowie. The song credits SM Entertainment’s in-house songwriter Yoo Young-jin as composer, lyricist and arranger; with Groovie K having a hand in the composition as well. While the entire album is labeled as Kpop, dance, contemporary R&B and teen pop, Tri-Angle sampled Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 in G minor (Hallyu Reviews, 2021), and is heard as the hook and an overlay in the chorus. This song is built on the typical pop song structure of verse-chorus-bridge which could be labeled as K-pop. However, it features a mishmash of other styles that includes classical nuances heard by the small string orchestra, sounds of grunge/punk rock through the guitar effects of distortion and overdrive in the bridge, and the powerhouse pop vocals of BoA, dubbed as the Queen of Kpop. Tri-Angle was really a representation of SM’s hottest artists in the early millennium of TVXQ, BoA and TraxX, who unfortunately now is a defunct-rock group creating a trifecta of collaborations of their time.

She earned first-place a year later in another Mnet show, Produce 101 (Season One) and debuted with I.O.I., which disbanded in 2017. Two years later, Somi released her solo debut “Birthday.”  Her fourth single “XOXO” was released in October 2021, the title track to her first full-length album with lyrics by Teddy, Danny Chung, Vince, Somi, and Kush. Teddy also composed the music alongside Pink Sweats, Pacific, and 24 who also handled the arrangement. Like “Birthday,” previous singles “What You Waiting For” and “Dumb Dumb,” and almost every song on her full-length, “XOXO” showcases Somi’s signature bright bubblegum sound.  “XOXO” is especially anthemic, centered on the hook-filled chorus that opens the song, with layers of chanted vocals over muted arpeggios and sparse beats sounding almost too large, too insistent. This effect is tastefully capped by how Somi sings “hoo-hoo” after each chant of “XOXO!”—soaring high above the wall of sound, creating an opening in the song that both verse and pre-chorus fill, making the chorus hit harder. The effect is unexpectedly reminiscent of “Where Is My Mind?” by American alt-rock group the Pixies. I can’t imagine Somi’s next single sounding larger than “XOXO”; the bigger impact might be in swerving towards an unexpectedly understated sound.

Hannah Lee Otto CL, known for her rapping, edgy unconventional styling, and melismatic vocals, perhaps represents an anomaly of the K-pop and entertainment industry: a post girlband veteran to go solo by severing ties with a big-name entertainment company, forging her own way through richly diverse collaborations and friendships across the industry and across the world—ranging from Diplo, ReQuest Dance Crew, Method Man, and ReQuest Dance Crew, to name a few. The diversity of CL’s collaborations and talents seem to reflect her diverse background, growing up in Korea, Japan, and schooling in France prior to her landing a spot in Kpop girl group 2NE1 in 2014 (Myers, 2021). Considered a pioneering Kpop female group, 2NE1’s tomboyish and punk attitude countered the image of cutesy girliness typical to Kpop at the time (Lee, 2021). CL’s independent projects reflect a continuation of 2NE1’s edge on her own terms, evolving her I AM THE BEST anthem swagger to self-reflective and self-empowering tracks in her truly independent full-length ALPHA (Kwak, 2021). ALPHA emerges after years of efforts in becoming an independent K-pop artist, formally leaving YG Entertainment in 2019, working a move stateside with Scooter Braun, and now under her own label, Very Cherry Record (Myers, 2021). ALPHA is CL’s first full-length album, following a train of collaborations, singles, and a mini album since going solo in 2014.  SPICY opens ALPHA with John Malkovich asking for “that sauce that is spicy made in Korea” and chanting “energy, power, chemistry” looping in his meditative voice in the background. CL answers the request for spicy with a battle-like rap declaring herself as the alpha, proud of her Korean spice, a metaphor that is sweeping culture worldwide. With a catchy beat and staccato, straightforward lyrics delivered over John Malkovich’s meditative echo, the song provides an accessible entry into the album and the signature CL attitude.   Sources CL. “SPICY.” YouTube. 24 August 2021. https://youtu.be/QMwJtMJLXE0 Kwak, Kristine. “CL Reintroduces Herself as the ‘Alpha.’ Rolling Stone, 20 Oct. 2021,    https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/cl-alpha-1244017/ Accessed 8  Nov. 2021.  Lee, Christine. “Review: On ALPHA, CL finishes what she started.” NPR, 27 Oct. 2021,  https://www.npr.org/2021/10/27/1049329622/on-alpha-cl-finishes-what-she-startedAccessed 8 Nov 2021.  Myers, Owen. “K-Pop Queen CL on making her indie comeback: ‘My album is like me writing a  book.’” Billboard, 16 Jan. 2021,  https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/cl-new-album-alpha-interview-k-pop-comeback-9510948/ Ngan Tran Kim Jonghyun, the main vocalist of SHINee, was also known as an extremely talented songwriter. A hidden gem from his discography is “It Must be Autumn” (also translated as “I guess now it’s the fall”), which debuted as a single on the Mnet show Monthly Live Connection. Featuring guest vocals from Go Youngbae (lead vocalist of the band SORAN), the song is co-written and co-composed by Jonghyun and Youngbae, with the arrangement done by Youngbae, Seo Myeon-ho, Lee Tae-wook, and Pyon Yoo-il. This is a delicate acoustic track that perfectly captures the sentiment of autumn. The song opens with a simple guitar melody that would form the backbone for the rest of the track. As if letting listeners into a secret, the acoustic strumming combined with Jonghyun and Youngbae’s quiet vocals immediately set the tone for an intimate late night conversation. Lyrically, it is about receiving a random call from an ex-lover who has moved on long ago, and then mentally falling apart like autumn leaves. It is easy to slip into the territory of ambient coffee shop music here, but a steady percussion beat arrives just in time for the second verse to give it a much-needed depth. Jonghyun’s soft, airy vocals and Youngbae’s warm, gentle timbre complement each other extremely well as their gorgeous harmonies flutter into the bridge, where the song finally flourishes – in its own subdued fashion. The bass ripples, the keyboard tiptoes, and the catalytic moment comes, ironically, when the narrator admits that “today, too, I am still standing here,” stuck in memories of the past. And so the track ends with the same restrained energy it started with, completely unable to move on. Sources Jonghyun x Youngbae. “It Must be Autumn.” YouTube. 29 October 2015. https://youtu.be/neftAitSVw8?t=127 (9 November 2021). Nykeah Parham No strangers to fantastic, other-worldly, or supernatural ideas, VIXX, the heralded “Concept Kings” of K-pop, announced the year-long project, VIXX 2016 Conception Trilogy. Each album in 2016 had a different concept based on a Greek deity, beginning with Zelos and the title track “Dynamite,” Hades and “Fantasy,” and ending with Kratos and “The Closer.” The Trilogy follows a man in his attempt to win over his love and the “fate” or “ruin” that befalls him. In “Fantasy,” the mortal man, N, has lost his love to Leo, someone in the underworld. Produced by the LA-based production team, Devinne Channel’s Kei Lim and Ryan Kim, “Fantasy” begins with Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata,” establishing the dark concept of Hades and the Underworld alongside Ravi’s deep and raspy tone in contrast to Leo’s falsetto. As soon as the introduction moves to the first verse, Ken’s mid-range vocal is underscored with not-so-subtle bass and snapping that resembles a clock ticking. There is a quick transition to Leo’s higher tone and the introduction of a rolling hi-hat that is all meant to showcase the main character losing his sanity as time progresses. By the time the pre-chorus and its marching drum begins, the energy and harmony have risen to an anxious heartbeat with the added string instruments in the chorus. There is a whiplash at the second verse, but that energy continues to build until the music stops suddenly and Moonlight Sonata plays again as a soft reprise even though the character has met a tragic end and not the fantasy he once imagined. In the end, all that is left is the admittance of defeat, “It’s all my fantasy.” Sources VIXX. “Fantasy.” YouTube. 14 August 2016. https://youtu.be/IuaRdAozUI0 (08 November 2021) Luisa do Amaral Red Velvet debuted in 2014 with the promise to bring together the elements that distinguished their predecessors, Girls’ Generation and f(x). One’s magical, sunny mass-appeal, and the other’s more experimental edge – through the fresh “Red” and the luscious “Velvet” concepts. Celebrating their seventh anniversary, the group made their first official release since ‘The ReVe Festival’ Finale (2019) with the six-track mini album Queendom (2021), released in August. The record includes the electro-punk track “Knock on Wood,” a B-side that uses a magical motif to compare the anxious desire for requited affections akin to casting a little spell (Yun, 2021). The track is credited to duo Moonshine (Jonatan Gusmark and Ludvig Evers), Cazzi Opeia and Ellen Berg, who have worked together in previous RV tracks such as the B-side “In & Out” (2019) and the title track “Peek-A-Boo” (2017). The Korean lyrics were written by Seo Ji-Eum from Jam Factory. “Knock on Wood” opens with bewitching wobbly synths; enchanting ad-libs and vocals are layered over little finger snaps, squelches and glassy sounds (Daly, 2021) for an eerie feeling that heightens the magical element. The lyrics switch between anxiously hopeful confessions and spells, with each member adding to the atmosphere. Irene’s and Yeri’s lines are playful, mischievous – complementing Seulgi’s honey-glazed uneasiness, as well as Joy’s innocent sweetness and Wendy’s buoyant brightness, whose voices lead the pre-chorus into the chorus. The more distressed undertones of the song are resolved at the whimsical bridge, and the fairytale-like story ends with a modified chorus that expresses the assurance of getting the desired outcome. All the red flavors are there, but with the otherworldly magical edge that Red Velvet carried on from the sweet witchcraft of f(x).

Accessed 7 Nov. 2021.  Tan Puay Shuang Being given the title of ‘self-producing idols’, SEVENTEEN is best known not only for their entertaining presence on variety shows, but also for being actively involved in various aspects of their comeback productions since debut. While one could visibly tell that the group’s music has drastically evolved and matured with time, not many were prepared to learn that the song-writing credits of their eighth mini-album Your Choice would include “hitman” Bang Sihyuk, the founder of HYBE Corporation that has just acquired their label Pledis Entertainment last year. Apart from him, the song also introduced the participation of Danke, Kyler Niko, Wonderkid, Christoffer Semelius, and H.Kenneth, some of which would be familiar to fans of other HYBE artists like TXT and ENHYPEN. Your Choice was released as the second part to SEVENTEEN’s yearlong project “The Power of ‘Love’”. Its title track “Ready To Love” features a prominent electric guitar and an anthemic chorus, which combined with the typical EDM beats forms an upbeat dance track that sings about the emotions of someone who has fallen in love with a friend (Chakraborty, 2021). Besides departing from the retro vibes that they have featured in their previous mini albums, Heng:garæ and Semicolon, the song also stands out for the amount of English being used in their lyrics. Despite the high energy and optimistic lyrics, the song eludes a somewhat melancholic tone, and the adlibs done by the members hold equal importance as the main melody, with the choreography during the last chorus specially made to highlight Seungkwan’s voice towards the end of the final chorus.  Sources HYBE LABELS. “SEVENTEEN (세븐틴) ‘Ready to love’ Official MV.” YouTube. 18 Jun 2021. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ffQuYFfY8 (8 Nov 2021).

Vitoria F. Doretto SF9 (shortened from Sensational Feeling 9) is the first dance boy group formed by FNC Entertainment. Known for their dynamic stage presence and experimental sound, and following their contract renovation, the nine members released on July 5, 2021, their ninth mini-album, Turn Over, with “Tear Drop” as the title track. The album follows their participation in Kingdom: Legendary War, where “Believer” was released as their final round song (which also appears on this album). The mini-album is the last part of the “9lory” series, which conveys their narrative world. In it, they show their willingness to pioneer fate on its own without yielding to what was already set. “Hey Hi Bye” is the last track with synth-brass-laden and peppy beats. The lyrics are written by Han Sung Ho (한성호),Young Bin  (영빈), Zuho (주호), and Hwiyoung (SF9s lead rapper). The composers are Han Sung Ho (한성호), Park Soo Suk (박수석), Bong Won Seok (봉원석), Moon Kim, and Tiyon TC Mack, and the arrangement was made by Park Soo Suk and Bong Won Seok. It is a fun track with a captivating mix of retro influences and a synth-like filter that adds to the instrumental – and their voices are capable of staying above it all, which is surprising. The track wraps up the album with a sweet tone, as its last verses are “Can’t nobody, can’t nobody love you like me/ Hey, hiya, bye.” Its first live stage was at the “2021 SF9 Online Fan Meeting ‘Reply FANTASY‘” (Laure, 2021).

Mariam Elba After 7 years, 2AM released its first, long-awaited EP after their hiatus that began in 2013 on November 1. Formed as a part of One Day, a project of JYP Entertainment in 2008, members Jinwoon, Changmin, Jo Kwon, and Seulong broke off to form 2AM. They quickly became known as the ballad-idol quartet, different from their One Day counterparts, 2PM. each bring different vocal styles elements to their ballads. Park Jin-young of JYP Entertainment as well as “hitman” bang, or Bang Si-hyuk, and now the chairman of HYBE, were both frequent producers and songwriters for the group. “Should’ve known” is their first of two title tracks on 2AM’s new EP, Ballad 21 F/W, written and composed by “Hitman” Bang, and arranged by Megatone and Score.  The song starts with a simple piano harmony as Jinwoon starts the song in an almost-hushed voice, Seulong ushers in the bridge, and builds a gradual crescendo as Jo Kwon and Changmin’s voices carry the crescendo into the chorus with soaring high notes, evoking the emotion of the lyrics charged with regret of a lost love. The third bridge highlights 2AM’s frequent harmonizing, a signature characteristic in their songs. A unique aspect of the music video is that it tells the first part of a story that the second title song’s music video continues. Starring One Day counterpart, 2PM’s Junho and Kim So-hyun, re-enact the story the lyrics tell in Should’ve known, and second title song No good in good-bye (잘 가라니).

New Perspectives in Popular Music Research: Changes and Turmoil  | H-Soz-Kult. Kommunikation und Fachinformation für die Geschichtswissenschaften | Geschichte im Netz | History in the web;"The University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway, invites applications for the interdisciplinary conference ""New Perspectives in Popular Music Research: Changes and Turmoil"" on 1–2 June 2022. Recent years have resulted in extensive changes in popular music production, dissemination, reception, and perception. New technological developments within music production and performance have created new creative possibilities for artists and bands as they make music and engage with the global music market. Many of these changes have been greatly accelerated by, if not the direct result of, the Covid 19 pandemic that has fundamentally disturbed the relationships between artists, fans, modes of performance, and music distribution. More than ever before, it has become critical to examine digitization, virtuality, creativity, and the music business as a whole in the context of such tumultuous changes. Thus, a two-day conference on new perspectives in popular music research will be held by the Department of Popular Music, Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Agder (UiA) in cooperation with the Popular Music Research Unit at UiA. The overarching goal of this conference is to address new perspectives on popular music through the lens of these recent changes and the perceived turmoil (and benefits) that has resulted from them. This marks the fourteenth anniversary of our PhD programme in popular music performance and provides an opportunity to showcase work by former graduates, current PhD candidates, and scholars associated with music research within the broad field of popular music studies. Two international keynote speakers will frame and contextualize the event. Keynote speakers will be announced early January 2022. It is also envisaged that contributors will have the opportunity to have their papers published through an international peer review channel. Proposals for 20-minute presentations consisting of 200 words and a brief biographical note (stating your qualifications and institutional affiliations) should be received by 3 February 2022 and addressed to: tor.dybo@uia.no We welcome proposals that deal in particular with the following themes: - Popular music and identity in the 21st Century- Social media and popular music- Virtuality, space, and place- New music technologies- Digitization- Distribution- Impact of Covid 19 in the live music sector- Music business and management- New technological developments in electronic music production- New developments in music dissemination and performance Organizing committee: - Professor Tor Dybo- Research Fellow Jelena Mijatovic- Research Fellow Zachary Bresler Advisory board: - Professor Michael Rauhut- Dr. Daniel Nordgård Practical information: - The seminar is free of charge and refreshments will be included.- The venue is University of Agder in Kristiansand, Norway: https://www.uia.no/en- The university has special rates with various hotels in Kristiansand. tor.dybo@uia.no Alle Rechte an Texten, Bildern und sonstigen Inhalten liegen bei Clio-online, H-NET und H-Soz-Kult 1996-2022.

The Cello Museum – Cold Cases in Music Research;"Museum open online 24/7. 365 (or 366) days/year  According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a cold case is “an unsolved criminal investigation … that has stopped being actively pursued because of a lack of evidence.” There are cold cases in music research, too, although they typically are not related to criminal activity. In January 2016, I offered to help the University of North Carolina at Greensboro Cello Music Collection identify a piece for cello and piano from the Maurice Eisenberg archive. This manuscript lacked a title page and the first page of music. I also offered to help with other mystery manuscripts. The archive curator, Stacey Krim, provided me with three cold cases: two from the Maurice Eisenberg archive and one from the Bernard Greenhouse archive. Image by Angeles Balaguer from Pixabay When I began my search, I thought it would take a couple of weeks. Instead, after six years of research, I am writing this article to announce that I have finally identified two of the three manuscripts. I have spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours using the tools I have, building relationships with performers, scholars, curators, and people who are more knowledgeable and resourceful than I am. This has been a humbling experience, something I have dedicated much prayer to. The research process revealed how little I know about composers and cello repertoire in general. A typical challenge for a researcher is finding the source’s location. In the case of this project, I did not know what I was looking for, much less where to find “it.” Examples include anonymous baroque and classical era manuscripts that were attributed to a composer of the time. These attributions are often changed based on new evidence. Someone once told me that, unless I am 100% convinced about the attribution, I should refrain from putting a name to the work. Franz Carl Bornschein The first work I recently (correctly) attributed is “Appalachian Legend” by Franz Carl Bornschein (10 February 1879 — 8 June 1948). Bornschein was a violinist and composer who was also a professor at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, MD. His early published works exemplify late-Romantic salon music and early 20th-Century part songs for various combinations of voices. When I undertook the identification challenge, I found the incomplete manuscript in the UNCG Greenhouse archive: http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/Greenhouse/id/9557/rec/11 In late 2018, I typeset the fragment to show to cellists and scholars who could help me in my journey. Then in 2020, I posted it on YouTube:  After dozens of educated guesses, ranging from Delius to Grainger to Bridge, Bantock, and Sowerby, I connected with dozens of amazing people and learned about cello repertoire I would have otherwise overlooked. But I still felt far from the goal.  I finally found out that the piece was by Bornschein from a January 1941 Baltimore Sun article about Eisenberg performing this work at Peabody. I matched the handwriting to another Bornschein manuscript. Maryland Center for History and Culture has confirmed that this piece is the “Appalachian Legend” by Bornschein. I thank all of the staff at the Maryland Center for helping me in my research. Digital Collection, Woodstock Public Library District. “Arthur Loeserman, violinist.” New York Heritage Digital Collections. 1927. https://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/nwkpld/id/153/rec/15 I was able to attribute the second work to Arthur Loeserman (4 October 1904 – 2 February 1999). The set of quartet parts is a part of the Bernard Greenhouse archive at UNCG. Each part has the title of “Scherzo divertissement” but lacks the composer’s name. Stacey Krim displayed these parts at an exhibit with the hopes that someone would be able to help identify them: Stacey Krim’s 2014 display of the Mystery Quartet Parts at UNCG. After finding the article about Bornschein, I decided to search for “Scherzo divertissement” in the old papers. The first article that popped up was a concert review from March 1928 in the Star Tribune, a “Scherzo divertissement” for string quartet by a violinist with the last name of Loeserman, who played in the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. I could not imagine many pieces with that title for string quartet. So, I then searched for a violinist named Loeserman, and came across the Arthur Loeserman Fellowship at the Garth Newel Music Center. I sent the YouTube link of the typesetting I had made to Garth Newel without any expectations: Within two days, I received a phone call from Amy Loeserman, Arthur Loeserman’s daughter, who was happy to hear that her father’s music was being played. Ms. Loeserman generously shared information about her father along with copies of his manuscripts. We hope that this project will increase interest in Arthur Loeserman’s music. I thank the Loeserman family for helping me in my research of this work. Expect to hear more about Bornschein and Loeserman very soon. The third cold case I have been working on is to find the composer of another manuscript in the Eisenberg archive at UNCG. Here are the clues I’ve discovered so far: This is my typesetting of the work: ﻿If you have an idea of who wrote it or other clues that might help, please comment below. Can you help solve the third cold case presented here? If so, please comment below. Know of any other cello-related musical “cold cases”? Please tell us in the comments. …  The Cello Museum is an online compendium of the cello, including articles, cello news, and digital cello exhibitions. The Cello Museum is for everyone who loves the cello.

Academy Awards New Music Research Grant - The American Academy of Audiology;"by Melinda Anderson The Academy’s Research Initiatives Committee is pleased to announce a new award for the Music and Hearing Research Grant Program. Promoting research in the profession of audiology is an important component of the long-range plan of the American Academy of Audiology. In support of this goal, the American Academy of Audiology and the American Academy of Audiology Foundation (AAAF) provide research funding through different grant programs. The Music and Hearing Research Grant program is a targeted effort to support research studies that will add to the body of knowledge and help to shape best practices in this area of audiology practice. The Music and Hearing Research Grant Program awards up to $10,000 based on the merit of the research project and application. Grants may be made for basic research or clinical/applied research with an overarching purpose ultimately to benefit musicians and others who work in the music industry. Audiologist investigators and student investigators (a doctoral student working towards a doctoral degree in audiology or hearing science who is completing a research project as a part of their course of study) are eligible to apply to the program. Student investigators have an added requirement of having a designated mentor to guide the research project. The Music and Hearing Research Grant Program is funded through the general sponsorship support of Michael Santucci, PhD. Dr. Santucci has dedicated his career to protecting the hearing of musicians through his own research and development work and promoting best practices in audiology. He recently led an Academy task force that prepared the recently released clinical consensus document titled Audiological Services for Musicians and Music Industry Personnel. The Academy plans to launch the third cycle of the grant program with a request for applications in late spring 2022 with a summer submission deadline. Grants undergo peer review for the final selection in fall 2022. The Research Initiatives Committee congratulates student investigator Allison Staker Woodford on the funding selection for her study Use of In-Ear Dosimetry to Understand Musicians’ Unique Sound Exposure (MUSE).  Ms. Woodford is a dual AuD and PhD student at the University of Texas Dallas. Through her clinical experiences, coursework, and AuD research project, she has developed a strong interest in hearing loss prevention, particularly music induced hearing loss, and has just started her PhD program. Ms. Woodford’s primary mentor is Colleen LePrell, PhD, chair of the department of speech, language, and hearing at UT Dallas. Dr. LePrell identifies Ms. Woodford as “top of her class in her clinical thinking” and describes the MUSE study as s “highly meritorious, investigating individual variation in vulnerability to music induced hearing disorders.” Ms. Woodford’s second mentor for the study is Heather Mayuk, AuD, who offers her experience as both a performing music artist and an audiologist who provides hearing health care for musicians. The MUSE research study will measure near-field and in-ear sound level exposure of musicians playing instruments near the ear, starting with the violin. Specific Aim 1 will assess bilateral sound level measurements collected inside and outside the ear. Potential sound level asymmetries will be measured in musicians playing their instrument using near-field and in-ear dosimeters. Bilateral transfer function of the open-ear (TFOE) measurements will be collected as an additional potential source of asymmetry. Specific Aim 2 will compare the sound levels reaching the inner ear and the auditory function of the musician participants, assessing potential asymmetries and early warning signs of damage to the auditory system through high-frequency audiometry (HFA), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and speech-in-noise testing. MUSE will enroll musicians ranging from pediatric early music learners to adult professional musicians, providing a lifetime approach to musician hearing health. Building on previous research exploring sound exposure levels and music induced hearing disorders (MIHD), MUSE will look specifically at the sound level reaching the inner ear of musicians while playing an instrument to understand the levels experienced by the auditory system of each musician. Melinda Anderson, PhD, is the chair of the Academy’s Research Initiatives Committee. Led by the World Health Organization (WHO) safe listening and protecting oneself against loud sounds is the theme of the World Hearing Day 2022, March 3. Audiologists have the power and the duty to spread the message about the importance of preventative care and timely action to prevent hearing loss. Not receiving prompt and professional… The American Academy of Audiology Foundation’s mission is to promote philanthropy in support of public awareness, research, and education in audiology and hearing and balance science. Offering a variety of scholarships to students pursuing degrees in audiology is one way in which the Foundation fulfills its mission to support education. The Foundation is pleased to… With its vision to support advancements in hearing and balance science that enhance the experiences of life, the AAA Foundation is committed to supporting audiology doctoral students as they continue their academic careers, learn exceptional clinical skills, and explore contemporary avenues of research.

AMRC to preserve and share historic trove of silent-era film scores | American Music Research Center | University of Colorado Boulder;"
 By Charles Wofford Between 1900 and 1929, when Sid Grauman ran silent films with live orchestral accompaniment in his Hollywood “movie palaces,” he probably never imagined that the thousands of orchestral scores used by his musicians would be recognized as important Americana in their own right. A century later—with a $116,916 grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Committee (NHPRC)—the University of Colorado Boulder’s American Music Research Center (AMRC) is creating a comprehensive digital archive of the Grauman Theatre Scores Collection. In collaboration with CU Libraries and the Silent Film Sound and Music Archive, the 3,854 scores of the collection will be digitized in multiple high-resolution, full-color formats and made available online at no charge to the public. An additional 192,700 preservation images will help preserve the particularities of the scores, such as handwritten markings from musicians and conductors. “[The Grauman Silent Film Scores Collection] is one of the most important collections anywhere,” says AMRC Director and Professor of Musicology Susan Thomas. “Because of the Grauman Theatre’s centrality in Los Angeles and U.S. film history, these scores can be considered foundational documents—not only for the cultural history of the United States, but also for the sonic construction of U.S. identity in the 20th century.”  The musical representations found in the Grauman collection inspired film composers of the following generation, such as Max Steiner and Alfred Newman; they, in turn, influenced famous film composers from Jerry Goldsmith and Henry Mancini to today’s superstars, including John Williams, Hans Zimmer and others. The collection was donated to the AMRC in 2019 by Rodney Sauer. A pianist, accordionist and director of the Monto Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Sauer drove the roughly 5,000 pounds of sheet music from Los Angeles to his Louisville, Colorado, home in 2013, narrowly averting catastrophe in the 2013 Boulder County floods. “I want to use this music, I don’t necessarily want to own it,” Sauer previously stated in the Coloradan Alumni Magazine. The AMRC is partnering with Sauer to produce video tutorials to guide performance-oriented musicians on everything from genre selection to timing and period aesthetics. The AMRC is also working to produce music packets for K-12 musicians, especially high school orchestras, who will be able to create their own scores for specific films. “This project is not about moving the music from one dusty attic to another,” says AMRC Assistant Director and Archivist Jessie de la Cruz. “This archive will be a living part of the community.” Give to the AMRC               Get AMRC Updates                        Facebook      Twitter      YouTube       288 UCBBoulder, Colorado  80309-0288303-735-3645  University of Colorado Boulder© Regents of the University of Colorado

Latin Grammys cap a blockbuster year for Latin Music - Music Business Worldwide;"The following op/ed comes from Russ Crupnick, Managing Partner of marketing research and industry analysis firm MusicWatch. On November 18 the music community celebrated the Latin Grammys. In an era where music and movie award shows are experiencing cataclysmic declines in viewership, the Latin Grammys belted one out of the park.  According to numbers just released by Univision, the telecast garnered 5.9 million viewers, an 11% increase over last year and the best audience since 2014.  By contrast the March Grammy telecast audience declined by 53%, VMA viewership was off 50% and the CMA Awards dropped nearly 40% of watchers since 2019.  If you were watching US revenue trends for the Latin genre, or following music fans, this surge would not be a surprise. Latin is the fastest growing genre in the US, and fan engagement is much stronger than for music in general.   It wasn’t always like that. If you grew up in the 60’s dad might have played Jobim’s “Girl From Ipanema” on the “hi-fi”.  Santana’s Oye Como Va was the rare Latin influenced rock song; it was actually penned by Tito Puente.  Our daughters raged on Shakira’s Laundry Service CDs, which sold over 13 million units worldwide. But these were outliers who didn’t change our fundamental listening habits.  With the advent of streaming, social media and video platforms, all that has changed.   Let’s examine the data more closely. Over the past two years US revenues for recorded music in the Latin genre have grown by a whopping 63%(comparing 1H ’21 to 1H’19).  The bulk of growth is coming from streaming. In the past, artists relied on radio which curated a highly selective and limited playlist. Whether you prefer rap or rock or dance, streaming platforms serve music from a more diverse stable of artists, across countries, cultures and languages. “Whether you prefer rap or rock or dance, streaming platforms serve music from a more diverse stable of artists, across countries, cultures and languages.” As Michelle Ballantyne of the RIAA recently noted “there’s a rising openness to new artists, music and ways of listening… with younger fans now spending 20% off their time listening in languages other than English”. With the globalization of streaming record labels have been able to invest in introducing Latin artists to the US and other territories with much more economy than in CD days.  Social media apps make it easier than ever to reach Latin fans or to make new ones. Eight of ten Latin fans used a social platform to interact with music artists, and 50% used TikTok to watch dance videos or follow a music artist.  As one senior Latin Music executive at a streaming company put it: “We are finally seeing the enormous global influence of Latin American music consumption and buying power” That is so right. Based on a recent analysis of MusicWatch data conducted on behalf of Digital Media Association (DiMA), we learned that: That enthusiasm for music listening transcends the US. According to the IFPI 18 hours each week is spent listening to music; in Mexico listening hours rise to 26 weekly, 25 hours in Brazil, and 23 in Argentina.  It’s easy to ascribe these trends to the growing Hispanic and Latin populations in the US. There’s some truth to that, but 41% of Latin music fans don’t affiliate with Hispanic ethnicity. Streaming has opened the door to these audiences and helped to unlock the value that we see in the revenue numbers.  Are the Latin Grammy’s really the “big moment” for the genre? Consider this last bit of research. In the US, one in six over the age of 13 identify as Hispanic.  The 2021 Latin Grammy audience attracted 5.9 million viewers. The 2021 Grammy Awards telecast attracted 8.8 million viewers. “Eso es loco”. Music Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.

University of Amsterdam: Henkjan Honing and Sanneke Stigter receive PDI-SSH funding – India Education | Latest Education News  | Global Educational News | Recent Educational News;The funding was granted by the Platform Digital Infrastructure Social Sciences and Humanities (PDI-SSH). The platform uses resources from the SSH sector plan of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Eligible projects focus on digital infrastructure facilities within the domain of social science and humanities.A flexible and sustainable infrastructure for MUSic-related Citizen Science Listening Experiments [MUSCLE]Data science has had an enormous impact on music research in the last few years, with several international labs basing their scientific insights on large amounts of empirical data. The University of Amsterdam has contributed to this research by showing that engaging games can serve as a powerful method to attract hundreds of thousands reliable participant responses. This unprecedented scale is necessary to characterize musical behavior properly, in particular how it varies among individuals and across societies. In addition to the technical demands of game-like listening experiments, both music and citizen science require infrastructural support that is currently not addressed by any of the existing digital infrastructures (such as CLARIAH). Hence, the aim of the current proposal is to fill this gap by developing a flexible and sustainable infrastructure for music-related citizen science listening experiments, for domains that have special needs with regard to high-quality, platform-independent audio presentation, processing and timing of responses (e.g., music information retrieval, music cognition, computational musicology, phonetics and speech research). The software developed in the project will be made available as an open-source toolkit that both Dutch and international universities can choose to adapt on their own servers.Faculty of Scienceimprove the digital research chain around using Oral History and spoken narratives, with research into artworks and museums as a use case. Holding unique audiovisual recordings about artworks in their archives, museums have a severe backlog in disclosing and sharing this information, because of the laborious workflow of storing and transcribing, the sensitivity of some of the material, and the lack of tools to use and reflect upon the content. These are generic problems for all researchers engaging with spoken narratives. An improved and user friendly deposition workflow that automatically connects to an automatic speech transcription service will resolve a significant part of this problem. Additionally, the improved workflow enables the development of new tools that especially aim at facilitating reflection by contextualizing the source material with layers of user interpretations, placing the researcher’s viewpoint into perspective. Opening up the behind the scenes of museums in a smart way, OH-SMArt advances research with spoken narratives around artworks and contributes to existing digital research infrastructures with domain-wide applications for knowledge development.;https://indiaeducationdiary.in/university-of-amsterdam-henkjan-honing-and-sanneke-stigter-receive-pdi-ssh-funding/amp/;

AMRC to preserve and share historic trove of silent-era film scores | American Music Research Center | University of Colorado Boulder;"
 By Charles Wofford Between 1900 and 1929, when Sid Grauman ran silent films with live orchestral accompaniment in his Hollywood “movie palaces,” he probably never imagined that the thousands of orchestral scores used by his musicians would be recognized as important Americana in their own right. A century later—with a $116,916 grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Committee (NHPRC)—the University of Colorado Boulder’s American Music Research Center (AMRC) is creating a comprehensive digital archive of the Grauman Theatre Scores Collection. In collaboration with CU Libraries and the Silent Film Sound and Music Archive, the 3,854 scores of the collection will be digitized in multiple high-resolution, full-color formats and made available online at no charge to the public. An additional 192,700 preservation images will help preserve the particularities of the scores, such as handwritten markings from musicians and conductors. “[The Grauman Silent Film Scores Collection] is one of the most important collections anywhere,” says AMRC Director and Professor of Musicology Susan Thomas. “Because of the Grauman Theatre’s centrality in Los Angeles and U.S. film history, these scores can be considered foundational documents—not only for the cultural history of the United States, but also for the sonic construction of U.S. identity in the 20th century.”  The musical representations found in the Grauman collection inspired film composers of the following generation, such as Max Steiner and Alfred Newman; they, in turn, influenced famous film composers from Jerry Goldsmith and Henry Mancini to today’s superstars, including John Williams, Hans Zimmer and others. The collection was donated to the AMRC in 2019 by Rodney Sauer. A pianist, accordionist and director of the Monto Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Sauer drove the roughly 5,000 pounds of sheet music from Los Angeles to his Louisville, Colorado, home in 2013, narrowly averting catastrophe in the 2013 Boulder County floods. “I want to use this music, I don’t necessarily want to own it,” Sauer previously stated in the Coloradan Alumni Magazine. The AMRC is partnering with Sauer to produce video tutorials to guide performance-oriented musicians on everything from genre selection to timing and period aesthetics. The AMRC is also working to produce music packets for K-12 musicians, especially high school orchestras, who will be able to create their own scores for specific films. “This project is not about moving the music from one dusty attic to another,” says AMRC Assistant Director and Archivist Jessie de la Cruz. “This archive will be a living part of the community.” Give to the AMRC               Get AMRC Updates                        Facebook      Twitter      YouTube       288 UCBBoulder, Colorado  80309-0288303-735-3645  University of Colorado Boulder© Regents of the University of Colorado
